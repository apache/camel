*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Caffeine Cache component enables you to perform caching operations using
the simple cache from Caffeine.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to
their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-caffeine</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------------
caffeine-cache://cacheName[?options]
-----------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following
format, `?option=value&option=#beanRef&...`

== Options


// component options: START
The Caffeine Cache component supports 17 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *action* (producer) | To configure the default cache action. If an action is set in the message header, then the operation from the header takes precedence. |  | String
| *cacheLoader* (producer) | To configure a CacheLoader in case of a LoadCache use |  | CacheLoader
| *createCacheIfNotExist* (producer) | Configure if a cache need to be created if it does exist or can't be pre-configured. | true | boolean
| *evictionType* (producer) | Set the eviction Type for this cache. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: size_based, time_based | SIZE_BASED | EvictionType
| *expireAfterAccessTime* (producer) | Set the expire After Access Time in case of time based Eviction (in seconds) | 300 | int
| *expireAfterWriteTime* (producer) | Set the expire After Access Write in case of time based Eviction (in seconds) | 300 | int
| *initialCapacity* (producer) | Set the initial Capacity for the cache | 10000 | int
| *key* (producer) | To configure the default action key. If a key is set in the message header, then the key from the header takes precedence. |  | Object
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *maximumSize* (producer) | Set the maximum size for the cache | 10000 | int
| *removalListener* (producer) | Set a specific removal Listener for the cache |  | RemovalListener
| *statsCounter* (producer) | Set a specific Stats Counter for the cache stats |  | StatsCounter
| *statsEnabled* (producer) | To enable stats on the cache | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Sets the global component configuration |  | CaffeineConfiguration
| *keyType* (advanced) | The cache key type, default java.lang.Object |  | String
| *valueType* (advanced) | The cache value type, default java.lang.Object |  | String

// endpoint options: START
The Caffeine Cache endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
caffeine-cache:cacheName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *cacheName* | *Required* the cache name |  | String

| *statsEnabled* (producer) | To enable stats on the cache | false | boolean
| *keyType* (advanced) | The cache key type, default java.lang.Object |  | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *valueType* (advanced) | The cache value type, default java.lang.Object |  | String

== Examples

You can use your cache with the following code:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
@Override
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
    return new RouteBuilder() {
        public void configure() {
            from("direct://start")
                .to("caffeine-cache://cache?action=PUT&key=1")
                .to("caffeine-cache://cache?key=1&action=GET")
                .log("Test! ${body}")
                .to("mock:result");
        }
    };
}
------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll work always on the same cache in the registry.

== Check operation result

Each time you'll use an operation on the cache you'll have two different headers to check for status:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
CaffeineConstants.ACTION_HAS_RESULT
CaffeineConstants.ACTION_SUCCEEDED
------------------------------------------------------------
