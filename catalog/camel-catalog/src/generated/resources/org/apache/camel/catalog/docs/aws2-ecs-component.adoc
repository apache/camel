*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 ECS component supports create, delete, describe and list clusters
https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[AWS ECS] clusters instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon ECS. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS].

[NOTE]
====
The AWS2 ECS component is not supported in OSGI

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws2-ecs://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) component supports 16 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (producer) | Component configuration |  | ECS2Configuration
| *ecsClient* (producer) | *Autowired* To use a existing configured AWS ECS as client |  | EcsClient
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of: listClusters, describeCluster, createCluster, deleteCluster |  | ECS2Operations
| *overrideEndpoint* (producer) | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | boolean
| *pojoRequest* (producer) | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not | false | boolean
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the ECS client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the ECS client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the ECS client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which ECS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *trustAllCertificates* (producer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *uriEndpointOverride* (producer) | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option |  | String
| *useDefaultCredentialsProvider* (producer) | Set whether the ECS client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

// endpoint options: START
The AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws2-ecs:label

with the following path and query parameters:

Required ECS component options

You have to provide the amazonECSClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS] service.

== Usage

=== Static credentials vs Default Credential Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static credentials, by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and set it to true.

 - Java system properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey
 - Environment variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
 - Web Identity Token from AWS STS.
 - The shared credentials and config files.
 - Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the environment variable AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI is set.
 - Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials. 

For more information about this you can look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS credentials documentation]

=== Message headers evaluated by the ECS producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsECSMaxResults` |`Integer` |The limit number of results while listing clusters

|`CamelAwsECSOperation` |`String` |The operation we want to perform

|`CamelAwsECSClusterName` |`String` |The cluster name
|=======================================================================

=== ECS Producer operations

Camel-AWS ECS component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listClusters
- createCluster
- describeCluster
- deleteCluster

== Producer Examples

- listClusters: this operation will list the available clusters in ECS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listClusters")
    .to("aws2-ecs://test?ecsClient=#amazonEcsClient&operation=listClusters")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Using a POJO as body

Sometimes build an AWS Request can be complex, because of multiple options. We introduce the possibility to use a POJO as body.
In AWS ECS there are multiple operations you can submit, as an example for List cluster request, you can do something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setBody(ListClustersRequest.builder().maxResults(10).build())
  .to("aws2-ecs://test?ecsClient=#amazonEcsClient&operation=listClusters&pojoRequest=true")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll pass the request directly without the need of passing headers and options specifically related to this operation.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-ecs</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
