The Fault Tolerance Configuration EIP supports 13 options which are listed below:

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *circuitBreakerRef* | Refers to an existing io.smallrye.faulttolerance.core.circuit.breaker.CircuitBreaker instance to lookup and use from the registry. When using this, then any other circuit breaker options are not in use. |  | String
| *delay* | Control how long the circuit breaker stays open. The default is 5 seconds. | 5s | String
| *successThreshold* | Controls the number of trial calls which are allowed when the circuit breaker is half-open | 1 | Integer
| *requestVolumeThreshold* | Controls the size of the rolling window used when the circuit breaker is closed | 20 | Integer
| *failureRatio* | Configures the failure rate threshold in percentage. If the failure rate is equal or greater than the threshold the CircuitBreaker transitions to open and starts short-circuiting calls. The threshold must be greater than 0 and not greater than 100. Default value is 50 percentage. | 50 | Integer
| *timeoutEnabled* | Whether timeout is enabled or not on the circuit breaker. Default is false. | false | Boolean
| *timeoutDuration* | Configures the thread execution timeout. Default value is 1 second. | 1s | String
| *timeoutPoolSize* | Configures the pool size of the thread pool when timeout is enabled. Default value is 10. | 10 | Integer
| *timeoutScheduledExecutor{zwsp}ServiceRef* | References to a custom thread pool to use when timeout is enabled |  | String
| *bulkheadEnabled* | Whether bulkhead is enabled or not on the circuit breaker. Default is false. | false | Boolean
| *bulkheadMaxConcurrentCalls* | Configures the max amount of concurrent calls the bulkhead will support. | 10 | Integer
| *bulkheadWaitingTaskQueue* | Configures the task queue size for holding waiting tasks to be processed by the bulkhead. | 10 | Integer
| *bulkheadExecutorServiceRef* | References to a custom thread pool to use when bulkhead is enabled. |  | String
