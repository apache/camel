*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The SNMP component gives you the ability to poll SNMP capable devices
or receiving traps

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-snmp</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

--------------------------------
snmp://hostname[:port][?Options]
--------------------------------

The component supports polling OID values from an SNMP enabled device
and receiving traps.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Snmp Producer 

*Available from 2.18 release*

It can also be used to request information using GET method.

The response body type is org.apache.camel.component.snmp.SnmpMessage

== Options


// component options: START
The SNMP component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The SNMP endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
snmp:host:port
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===

=== Query Parameters (37 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type

| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *delay* (consumer) | Sets update rate in seconds | 60000 | long
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *treeList* (consumer) | Sets the flag whether the scoped PDU will be displayed as the list if it has child elements in its tree | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler

| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again.

== The result of a poll

Given the situation, that I poll for the following OIDs:

*OIDs*

-------------------------
1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.2.1.5.1
1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.5.1.1.1
1.3.6.1.2.1.43.5.1.1.11.1
-------------------------

The result will be the following:

*Result of toString conversion*

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<snmp>
  <entry>
    <oid>1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0</oid>
    <value>6 days, 21:14:28.00</value>
  </entry>
  <entry>
    <oid>1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.2.1.5.1</oid>
    <value>2</value>
  </entry>
  <entry>
    <oid>1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.5.1.1.1</oid>
    <value>3</value>
  </entry>
  <entry>
    <oid>1.3.6.1.2.1.43.5.1.1.11.1</oid>
    <value>6</value>
  </entry>
  <entry>
    <oid>1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0</oid>
    <value>My Very Special Printer Of Brand Unknown</value>
  </entry>
</snmp>
-----------------------------------------------------------

As you maybe recognized there is one more result than
requested....1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0. +
 This one is filled in by the device automatically in this special case.
So it may absolutely happen, that you receive more than you
requested...be prepared.

*OID starting with dot representation*
-------------------------
.1.3.6.1.4.1.6527.3.1.2.21.2.1.50
-------------------------
As you may notice, default snmpVersion is 0 which means *version1* in the endpoint if it is not set explicitly. Make sure you explicitly set snmpVersion which is not default value, of course in a case of where you are able to query SNMP tables with different versions. Other possible values are *version2c* and *version3*.

== Examples

Polling a remote device:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
snmp:192.168.178.23:161?protocol=udp&type=POLL&oids=1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up a trap receiver (*Note that no OID info is needed here!*):

-----------------------------------------
snmp:127.0.0.1:162?protocol=udp&type=TRAP
-----------------------------------------

You can get the community of SNMP TRAP with message
header 'securityName', +
 peer address of the SNMP TRAP with message header 'peerAddress'.

Routing example in Java: (converts the SNMP PDU to XML String)

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("snmp:192.168.178.23:161?protocol=udp&type=POLL&oids=1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0").
convertBodyTo(String.class).
to("activemq:snmp.states");
