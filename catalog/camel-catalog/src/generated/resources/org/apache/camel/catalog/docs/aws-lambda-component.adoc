*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Lambda component supports create, get, list, delete and invoke
https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda] functions.

*Prerequisites*

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Lambda. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda].

When creating a Lambda function, you need to specify a IAM role which has at least the AWSLambdaBasicExecuteRole policy attached.

*Warning*

Lambda is regional service. Unlike S3 bucket, Lambda function created in a given region is not available on other regions.

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws-lambda://functionName[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Lambda component supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoDiscoverClient* (common) | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (producer) | The AWS Lambda default configuration |  | LambdaConfiguration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to perform. It can be listFunctions, getFunction, createFunction, deleteFunction or invokeFunction. There are 18 enums and the value can be one of: listFunctions, getFunction, createAlias, deleteAlias, getAlias, listAliases, createFunction, deleteFunction, invokeFunction, updateFunction, createEventSourceMapping, deleteEventSourceMapping, listEventSourceMapping, listTags, tagResource, untagResource, publishVersion, listVersions | invokeFunction | LambdaOperations
| *region* (producer) | Amazon AWS Region. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *awsLambdaClient* (advanced) | To use a existing configured AwsLambdaClient as client |  | AWSLambda
| *proxyHost* (proxy) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Lambda client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (proxy) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Lambda client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (proxy) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Lambda client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

// endpoint options: START
The AWS Lambda endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

with the following path and query parameters:

Required Lambda component options

You have to provide the awsLambdaClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[Amazon Lambda] service.

== Example

To have a full understanding of how the component works, you may have a look at this https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-aws/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/aws/lambda/integration/LambdaComponentIntegrationTest.java[integration test]

== Automatic detection of AmazonLambda client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonLambda bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.


== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-lambda</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
