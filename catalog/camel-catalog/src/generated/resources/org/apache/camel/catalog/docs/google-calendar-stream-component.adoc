*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Google Calendar Stream component provides access
to https://calendar.google.com[Calendar] via
the https://developers.google.com/calendar/overview[Google Calendar
Web APIs]. This component provides the streaming feature for Calendar events.

Google Calendar uses
the https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2[OAuth 2.0
protocol] for authenticating a Google account and authorizing access to
user data. Before you can use this component, you will need
to https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth[create an
account and generate OAuth credentials]. Credentials comprise of a
clientId, clientSecret, and a refreshToken. A handy resource for
generating a long-lived refreshToken is
the https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground[OAuth playground].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-google-calendar</artifactId>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
        <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----

== URI Format

The Google Calendar Component uses the following URI format:

----
google-calendar-stream://index?[options]
----


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The Google Calendar Stream component supports 19 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *applicationName* (consumer) | Google Calendar application name. Example would be camel-google-calendar/1.0 |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *calendarId* (consumer) | The calendarId to be used | primary | String
| *clientId* (consumer) | Client ID of the calendar application |  | String
| *configuration* (consumer) | The configuration |  | GoogleCalendarStreamConfiguration
| *considerLastUpdate* (consumer) | Take into account the lastUpdate of the last event polled as start date for the next poll | false | boolean
| *consumeFromNow* (consumer) | Consume events in the selected calendar from now on | true | boolean
| *maxResults* (consumer) | Max results to be returned | 10 | int
| *query* (consumer) | The query to execute on calendar |  | String
| *scopes* (consumer) | Specifies the level of permissions you want a calendar application to have to a user account. See \https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth for more info. |  | List
| *syncFlow* (consumer) | Sync events, see \https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/sync Note: not compatible with: 'query' and 'considerLastUpdate' parameters | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *clientFactory* (advanced) | The client Factory |  | GoogleCalendarClientFactory
| *accessToken* (security) | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. |  | String
| *clientSecret* (security) | Client secret of the calendar application |  | String
| *emailAddress* (security) | The emailAddress of the Google Service Account. |  | String
| *p12FileName* (security) | The name of the p12 file which has the private key to use with the Google Service Account. |  | String
| *refreshToken* (security) | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Calendar component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. |  | String
| *user* (security) | The email address of the user the application is trying to impersonate in the service account flow. |  | String

(an API method may have multiple signatures due to overloading):

[source,java]
----

com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar.CalendarList.Delete delete(String calendarId);

com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar.CalendarList.Get get(String calendarId);

com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar.CalendarList.Insert insert(com.google.api.services.calendar.model.CalendarListEntry content);

com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar.CalendarList.Patch patch(String calendarId, com.google.api.services.calendar.model.CalendarListEntry content);

com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar.CalendarList.Update update(String calendarId, com.google.api.services.calendar.model.CalendarListEntry content);

com.google.api.services.calendar.Calendar.CalendarList.Watch watch(com.google.api.services.calendar.model.Channel content);

----

The list API is defined in the syntax as follows:

----
google-calendar-stream:list/methodName?[parameters]
----

The 6 method(s) is listed in the table below.
(API methods can have a shorthand alias name which can be used in the syntax instead of the name)

| *patch* |  | Updates an entry on the user's calendar list
| *update* |  | Updates an entry on the user's calendar list
| *watch* |  | Watch for changes to CalendarList resources
|===

The list API method(s) has the following set of parameters listed in the table below:
[width="100%",cols="2,2,4,2",options="header"]
|===
| Method | Parameter | Description | Type
| delete | *calendarId* |  Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the primary keyword. | String
| get | *calendarId* |  Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the primary keyword. | String
| insert | *content* |  The com.google.api.services.calendar.model.CalendarListEntry | CalendarListEntry
| patch | *calendarId* |  Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the primary keyword. | String
| patch | *content* |  The com.google.api.services.calendar.model.CalendarListEntry | CalendarListEntry

In addition to the parameters above, the list API can also use from the 34 endpoint query option
which is listed in the _Query Parameters_ section.

Any of the parameters can be provided in either the endpoint URI, or dynamically in a message header.
The message header name must be of the format `CamelGoogleCalendarStream.parameter`.
The `inBody` parameter overrides message header, i.e. the endpoint parameter `inBody=myParameterNameHere`
would override a `CamelGoogleCalendarStream.myParameterNameHere` header.
