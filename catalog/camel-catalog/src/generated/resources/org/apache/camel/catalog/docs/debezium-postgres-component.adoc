*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*


The Debezium PostgresSQL component is wrapper around https://debezium.io/[Debezium] using https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html[Debezium Embedded], which enables Change Data Capture from PostgresSQL database using Debezium without the need for Kafka or Kafka Connect.

*Note on handling failures:* Per https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html#_handling_failures[Debezium Embedded Engine] documentation, the engines is actively recording source offsets and periodically flushes these offsets to a persistent storage, so when the application is restarted or crashed, the engine will resume from the last recorded offset.
Thus, at normal operation, your downstream routes will receive each event exactly once, however in case of an application crash (not having a graceful shutdown), the application will resume from the last recorded offset,
which may result in receiving duplicate events immediately after the restart. Therefore, your downstream routes should be tolerant enough of such case and deduplicate events if needed.

*Note:* The Debezium PostgresSQL component is currently not supported in OSGi

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component.

'columns_diff' (the default) is the safest mode, ensuring the in-memory schema stays in-sync with the database table's schema at all times. 'columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast' instructs the connector to refresh the in-memory schema cache if there is a discrepancy between it and the schema derived from the incoming message, unless unchanged TOASTable data fully accounts for the discrepancy. This setting can improve connector performance significantly if there are frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data that are rarely part of these updates.

| *snapshotCustomClass* (postgres) | When 'snapshot.mode' is set as custom, this setting must be set to specify a fully qualified class name to load (via the default class loader).This class must implement the 'Snapshotter' interface and is called on each app boot to determine whether to do a snapshot and how to build queries. |  | String
| *snapshotDelayMs* (postgres) | The number of milliseconds to delay before a snapshot will begin. | 0ms | long
| *snapshotFetchSize* (postgres) | The maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while performing a snapshot |  | int

Options include: 'always' to specify that the connector run a snapshot each time it starts up; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally start emitting changes;'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the last position (LSN) recorded by the server; and'exported' to specify the connector should run a snapshot based on the position when the replication slot was created; 'custom' to specify a custom class with 'snapshot.custom_class' which will be loaded and used to determine the snapshot, see docs for more details. | initial | String
| *snapshotSelectStatement{zwsp}Overrides* (postgres) | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *sourceStructVersion* (postgres) | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String

| *timePrecisionMode* (postgres) | Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive' (the default) bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column's precision; 'adaptive_time_microseconds' like 'adaptive' mode, but TIME fields always use microseconds precision;'connect' always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision . | adaptive | String
| *toastedValuePlaceholder* (postgres) | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database. If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | __debezium_unavailable_value | String
| *tombstonesOnDelete* (postgres) | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | boolean
| *xminFetchIntervalMs* (postgres) | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. | 0ms | long

Each expression must match the pattern ':',where the table names could be defined as (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector,and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. For any table without an explicit key configuration the table's primary key column(s) will be used as message key.Example: dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id |  | String
| *pluginName* (postgres) | The name of the Postgres logical decoding plugin installed on the server. Supported values are 'decoderbufs' and 'wal2json'. Defaults to 'decoderbufs'. | decoderbufs | String
| *pollIntervalMs* (postgres) | Frequency in milliseconds to wait for new change events to appear after receiving no events. Defaults to 500ms. | 500ms | long
| *provideTransactionMetadata* (postgres) | Enables transaction metadata extraction together with event counting | false | boolean
| *publicationAutocreateMode* (postgres) | Applies only when streaming changes using pgoutput.Determine how creation of a publication should work, the default is all_tables.DISABLED - The connector will not attempt to create a publication at all. The expectation is that the user has created the publication up-front. If the publication isn't found to exist upon startup, the connector will throw an exception and stop.ALL_TABLES - If no publication exists, the connector will create a new publication for all tables. Note this requires that the configured user has access. If the publication already exists, it will be used. i.e CREATE PUBLICATION FOR ALL TABLES;FILTERED - If no publication exists, the connector will create a new publication for all those tables matchingthe current filter configuration (see table/database include/exclude list properties). If the publication already exists, it will be used. i.e CREATE PUBLICATION FOR TABLE | all_tables | String
| *publicationName* (postgres) | The name of the Postgres 10 publication used for streaming changes from a plugin.Defaults to 'dbz_publication' | dbz_publication | String
| *queryFetchSize* (postgres) | The maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while streaming. A value of 0 uses the default JDBC fetch size. | 0 | int
| *retriableRestartConnectorWait{zwsp}Ms* (postgres) | Time to wait before restarting connector after retriable exception occurs. Defaults to 10000ms. | 10s | long
| *sanitizeFieldNames* (postgres) | Whether field names will be sanitized to Avro naming conventions | false | boolean

| *schemaIncludeList* (postgres) | The schemas for which events should be captured |  | String
| *schemaRefreshMode* (postgres) | Specify the conditions that trigger a refresh of the in-memory schema for a table. 'columns_diff' (the default) is the safest mode, ensuring the in-memory schema stays in-sync with the database table's schema at all times. 'columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast' instructs the connector to refresh the in-memory schema cache if there is a discrepancy between it and the schema derived from the incoming message, unless unchanged TOASTable data fully accounts for the discrepancy. This setting can improve connector performance significantly if there are frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data that are rarely part of these updates. However, it is possible for the in-memory schema to become outdated if TOASTable columns are dropped from the table. | columns_diff | String
| *schemaWhitelist* (postgres) | The schemas for which events should be captured (deprecated, use schema.include.list instead) |  | String
| *skippedOperations* (postgres) | The comma-separated list of operations to skip during streaming, defined as: 'i' for inserts; 'u' for updates; 'd' for deletes. By default, no operations will be skipped. |  | String
| *slotDropOnStop* (postgres) | Whether or not to drop the logical replication slot when the connector finishes orderlyBy default the replication is kept so that on restart progress can resume from the last recorded location | false | boolean

| *slotStreamParams* (postgres) | Any optional parameters used by logical decoding plugin. Semi-colon separated. E.g. 'add-tables=public.table,public.table2;include-lsn=true' |  | String
| *snapshotCustomClass* (postgres) | When 'snapshot.mode' is set as custom, this setting must be set to specify a fully qualified class name to load (via the default class loader).This class must implement the 'Snapshotter' interface and is called on each app boot to determine whether to do a snapshot and how to build queries. |  | String
| *snapshotDelayMs* (postgres) | The number of milliseconds to delay before a snapshot will begin. | 0ms | long
| *snapshotFetchSize* (postgres) | The maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while performing a snapshot |  | int
| *snapshotLockTimeoutMs* (postgres) | The maximum number of millis to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If locks cannot be acquired in this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. Defaults to 10 seconds | 10s | long
| *snapshotMode* (postgres) | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'always' to specify that the connector run a snapshot each time it starts up; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally start emitting changes;'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the last position (LSN) recorded by the server; and'exported' to specify the connector should run a snapshot based on the position when the replication slot was created; 'custom' to specify a custom class with 'snapshot.custom_class' which will be loaded and used to determine the snapshot, see docs for more details. | initial | String
| *snapshotSelectStatement{zwsp}Overrides* (postgres) | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *sourceStructVersion* (postgres) | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String
| *statusUpdateIntervalMs* (postgres) | Frequency in milliseconds for sending replication connection status updates to the server. Defaults to 10 seconds (10000 ms). | 10s | int
| *tableBlacklist* (postgres) | A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring (deprecated, use table.exclude.list instead) |  | String
| *tableExcludeList* (postgres) | A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring |  | String
| *tableIgnoreBuiltin* (postgres) | Flag specifying whether built-in tables should be ignored. | true | boolean

| *tableWhitelist* (postgres) | The tables for which changes are to be captured (deprecated, use table.include.list instead) |  | String
| *timePrecisionMode* (postgres) | Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive' (the default) bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column's precision; 'adaptive_time_microseconds' like 'adaptive' mode, but TIME fields always use microseconds precision;'connect' always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision . | adaptive | String
| *toastedValuePlaceholder* (postgres) | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database. If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | __debezium_unavailable_value | String
| *tombstonesOnDelete* (postgres) | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | boolean
| *xminFetchIntervalMs* (postgres) | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. | 0ms | long

== Message headers

=== Consumer headers

The following headers are available when consuming change events from Debezium.
[width="100%",cols="2m,2m,1m,5",options="header"]
|===
| Header constant                           | Header value                                   | Type        | Description
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_IDENTIFIER       | "CamelDebeziumIdentifier"                      | String      | The identifier of the connector, normally is this format "+++{server-name}.{database-name}.{table-name}+++".
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_KEY              | "CamelDebeziumKey"                             | Struct      | The key of the event, normally is the table Primary Key.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_SOURCE_METADATA  | "CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata"                  | Map         | The metadata about the source event, for example `table` name, database `name`, log position, etc, please refer to the Debezium documentation for more info.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_OPERATION        | "CamelDebeziumOperation"                       | String      | If presents, the type of event operation. Values for the connector are `c` for create (or insert), `u` for update, `d` for delete or `r` in case of a snapshot event.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_TIMESTAMP        | "CamelDebeziumTimestamp"                       | Long        | If presents, the time (using the system clock in the JVM) at which the connector processed the event.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_BEFORE           | "CamelDebeziumBefore"                          | Struct     | If presents, contains the state of the row before the event occurred.
|===

== Message body
The message body if is not `null` (in case of tombstones), it contains the state of the row after the event occurred as `Struct` format or `Map` format if you use the included Type Converter from `Struct` to `Map` (please look below for more explanation).

== Samples

=== Consuming events

Here is a very simple route that you can use in order to listen to Debezium events from PostgresSQL connector.
[source,java]
----
from("debezium-postgres:dbz-test-1?offsetStorageFileName=/usr/offset-file-1.dat&databaseHostName=localhost&databaseUser=debezium&databasePassword=dbz&databaseServerName=my-app-connector&databaseHistoryFileName=/usr/history-file-1.dat")
    .log("Event received from Debezium : ${body}")
    .log("    with this identifier ${headers.CamelDebeziumIdentifier}")
    .log("    with these source metadata ${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata}")
    .log("    the event occured upon this operation '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceOperation}'")
    .log("    on this database '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[db]}' and this table '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[table]}'")
    .log("    with the key ${headers.CamelDebeziumKey}")
    .log("    the previous value is ${headers.CamelDebeziumBefore}")
----

By default, the component will emit the events in the body and `CamelDebeziumBefore` header as https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html[`Struct`] data type, the reasoning behind this, is to perceive the schema information in case is needed.
However, the component as well contains a xref:manual::type-converter.adoc[Type Converter] that converts
from default output type of https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html[`Struct`] to `Map` in order to leverage Camel's rich xref:manual::data-format.adoc[Data Format] types which many of them work out of box with `Map` data type.
To use it, you can either add `Map.class` type when you access the message e.g: `exchange.getIn().getBody(Map.class)`, or you can convert the body always to `Map` from the route builder by adding `.convertBodyTo(Map.class)` to your Camel Route DSL after `from` statement.

We mentioned above about the schema, which can be used in case you need to perform advance data transformation and the schema is needed for that. If you choose not to convert your body to `Map`,
you can obtain the schema information as https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Schema.html[`Schema`] type from `Struct` like this:
[source,java]
----
from("debezium-postgres:[name]?[options]])
    .process(exchange -> {
        final Struct bodyValue = exchange.getIn().getBody(Struct.class);
        final Schema schemaValue = bodyValue.schema();

        log.info("Body value is :" + bodyValue);
        log.info("With Schema : " + schemaValue);
        log.info("And fields of :" + schemaValue.fields());
        log.info("Field name has `" + schemaValue.field("name").schema() + "` type");
    });
----

*Important Note:* This component is a thin wrapper around Debezium Engine as mentioned, therefore before using this component in production, you need to understand how Debezium works and how configurations can reflect the expected behavior, especially in regards to https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html#_handling_failures[handling failures].
