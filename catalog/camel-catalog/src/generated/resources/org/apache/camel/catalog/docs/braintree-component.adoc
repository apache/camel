*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Braintree component provides access to
https://www.braintreepayments.com/[Braintree Payments] trough through
theirs https://developers.braintreepayments.com/start/hello-server/java[Java
SDK].

All client applications need API credential in order to process
payments. In order to use camel-braintree with your account, you'll need
to create a new
https://www.braintreepayments.com/get-started[Sandbox] or https://www.braintreepayments.com/signup[Production]
account.


Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:


[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-braintree</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>

== Braintree Options




// component options: START
The Braintree component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Component configuration |  | BraintreeConfiguration

// endpoint options: START
The Braintree endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
braintree:apiName/methodName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apiName* | *Required* What kind of operation to perform. There are 17 enums and the value can be one of: ADD_ON, ADDRESS, CLIENT_TOKEN, CREDIT_CARD_VERIFICATION, CUSTOMER, DISCOUNT, DISPUTE, DOCUMENT_UPLOAD, MERCHANT_ACCOUNT, PAYMENT_METHOD, PAYMENT_METHOD_NONCE, PLAN, REPORT, SETTLEMENT_BATCH_SUMMARY, SUBSCRIPTION, TRANSACTION, WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATION |  | BraintreeApiName

| *inBody* (common) | Sets the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body |  | String
| *merchantId* (common) | The merchant id provided by Braintree. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: END

== Producer Endpoints:

Producer endpoints can use endpoint prefixes followed by endpoint names
and associated options described next. A shorthand alias can be used for
some endpoints. The endpoint URI MUST contain a prefix.

Endpoint options that are not mandatory are denoted by []. When there
are no mandatory options for an endpoint, one of the set of [] options
MUST be provided. Producer endpoints can also use a special
option *inBody* that in turn should contain the name of the endpoint
option whose value will be contained in the Camel Exchange In message.

Any of the endpoint options can be provided in either the endpoint URI,
or dynamically in a message header. The message header name must be of
the format *CamelBraintree.<option>*. Note that the *inBody* option
overrides message header, i.e. the endpoint option *inBody=option* would
override a *CamelBraintree.option* header.

For more information on the endpoints and options see Braintree
references
at https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/overview[https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/overview]


== Consumer Endpoints

Any of the producer endpoints can be used as a consumer endpoint.
Consumer endpoints can
use http://camel.apache.org/polling-consumer.html#PollingConsumer-ScheduledPollConsumerOptions[Scheduled
Poll Consumer Options] to schedule endpoint invocation.
By default Consumer endpoints that return an array or
collection will generate one exchange per element, and their routes will
be executed once for each exchange. To change this behavior use the
property *splitResults=true* to return a single exchange for
the entire list or array. 

== Message Headers

Any URI option can be provided in a message header for producer
endpoints with a *CamelBraintree.* prefix.

== Message body

All result message bodies utilize objects provided by the Braintree Java
SDK. Producer endpoints can specify the option name for incoming message
body in the *inBody* endpoint parameter.
