*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

Testing of distributed and asynchronous processing is
notoriously difficult. The xref:mock-component.adoc[Mock], xref:mock-component.adoc[Test]
and xref:dataset-component.adoc[DataSet] endpoints work great with the
Camel Testing Framework to simplify your unit and
integration testing using
xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] and Camel's large range of Components
together with the powerful Bean Integration.

The *dataset-test* component extends the xref:mock-component.adoc[Mock] component to
support pulling messages from another endpoint on startup to set the
expected message bodies on the underlying xref:mock-component.adoc[Mock] endpoint.
That is, you use the test endpoint in a route and messages arriving on
it will be implicitly compared to some expected messages extracted from
some other location.

So you can use, for example, an expected set of message bodies as files.
This will then set up a properly configured xref:mock-component.adoc[Mock]
endpoint, which is only valid if the received messages match the number
of expected messages and their message payloads are equal.

The xref:others:test.adoc[Test] component is provided
directly in the camel-core.

== URI format

[source]
----
dataset-test:expectedMessagesEndpointUri
----

Where *expectedMessagesEndpointUri* refers to some other
Component URI that the expected message bodies are
pulled from before starting the test.

== URI Options

// component options: START
The DataSet Test component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The DataSet Test endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
dataset-test:name
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *name* | *Required* Name of endpoint to lookup in the registry to use for polling messages used for testing |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (16 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *anyOrder* (producer) | Whether the expected messages should arrive in the same order or can be in any order. | false | boolean
| *assertPeriod* (producer) | Sets a grace period after which the mock endpoint will re-assert to ensure the preliminary assertion is still valid. This is used for example to assert that exactly a number of messages arrives. For example if expectedMessageCount(int) was set to 5, then the assertion is satisfied when 5 or more message arrives. To ensure that exactly 5 messages arrives, then you would need to wait a little period to ensure no further message arrives. This is what you can use this method for. By default this period is disabled. | 0 | long
| *delimiter* (producer) | The split delimiter to use when split is enabled. By default the delimiter is new line based. The delimiter can be a regular expression. |  | String
| *expectedCount* (producer) | Specifies the expected number of message exchanges that should be received by this endpoint. Beware: If you want to expect that 0 messages, then take extra care, as 0 matches when the tests starts, so you need to set a assert period time to let the test run for a while to make sure there are still no messages arrived; for that use setAssertPeriod(long). An alternative is to use NotifyBuilder, and use the notifier to know when Camel is done routing some messages, before you call the assertIsSatisfied() method on the mocks. This allows you to not use a fixed assert period, to speedup testing times. If you want to assert that exactly n'th message arrives to this mock endpoint, then see also the setAssertPeriod(long) method for further details. | -1 | int
| *failFast* (producer) | Sets whether assertIsSatisfied() should fail fast at the first detected failed expectation while it may otherwise wait for all expected messages to arrive before performing expectations verifications. Is by default true. Set to false to use behavior as in Camel 2.x. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *reportGroup* (producer) | A number that is used to turn on throughput logging based on groups of the size. |  | int
| *resultMinimumWaitTime* (producer) | Sets the minimum expected amount of time (in millis) the assertIsSatisfied() will wait on a latch until it is satisfied | 0 | long
| *resultWaitTime* (producer) | Sets the maximum amount of time (in millis) the assertIsSatisfied() will wait on a latch until it is satisfied | 0 | long
| *retainFirst* (producer) | Specifies to only retain the first n'th number of received Exchanges. This is used when testing with big data, to reduce memory consumption by not storing copies of every Exchange this mock endpoint receives. Important: When using this limitation, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return the actual number of received Exchanges. For example if we have received 5000 Exchanges, and have configured to only retain the first 10 Exchanges, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return 5000 but there is only the first 10 Exchanges in the getExchanges() and getReceivedExchanges() methods. When using this method, then some of the other expectation methods is not supported, for example the expectedBodiesReceived(Object...) sets a expectation on the first number of bodies received. You can configure both setRetainFirst(int) and setRetainLast(int) methods, to limit both the first and last received. | -1 | int
| *retainLast* (producer) | Specifies to only retain the last n'th number of received Exchanges. This is used when testing with big data, to reduce memory consumption by not storing copies of every Exchange this mock endpoint receives. Important: When using this limitation, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return the actual number of received Exchanges. For example if we have received 5000 Exchanges, and have configured to only retain the last 20 Exchanges, then the getReceivedCounter() will still return 5000 but there is only the last 20 Exchanges in the getExchanges() and getReceivedExchanges() methods. When using this method, then some of the other expectation methods is not supported, for example the expectedBodiesReceived(Object...) sets a expectation on the first number of bodies received. You can configure both setRetainFirst(int) and setRetainLast(int) methods, to limit both the first and last received. | -1 | int
| *sleepForEmptyTest* (producer) | Allows a sleep to be specified to wait to check that this endpoint really is empty when expectedMessageCount(int) is called with zero | 0 | long
| *split* (producer) | If enabled the messages loaded from the test endpoint will be split using new line delimiters so each line is an expected message. For example to use a file endpoint to load a file where each line is an expected message. | false | boolean
| *timeout* (producer) | The timeout to use when polling for message bodies from the URI | 2000 | long
| *copyOnExchange* (producer) | Sets whether to make a deep copy of the incoming Exchange when received at this mock endpoint. Is by default true. | true | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Example

For example, you could write a test case as follows:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:someEndpoint").
  to("dataset-test:file://data/expectedOutput?noop=true");
----

If your test then invokes the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-mock/current/org/apache/camel/component/mock/MockEndpoint.html#assertIsSatisfied-org.apache.camel.CamelContext-[MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(camelContext)
method], your test case will perform the necessary assertions.

To see how you can set other expectations on the test endpoint, see the
xref:mock-component.adoc[Mock] component.
