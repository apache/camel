*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Google Storage component provides access to https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage] via
the https://github.com/googleapis/java-storage[google java storage library].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-google-storage</artifactId>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>

[[GoogleStorage-AuthenticationConfiguration]]

== Authentication Configuration

Google Storage component authentication is targeted for use with the GCP Service Accounts.
For more information please refer to https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication[Google Storage Auth Guide].

When you have the **service account key** you can provide authentication credentials to your application code.
Google security credentials can be set through the component endpoint:
[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------------
String endpoint = "google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json";
--------------------------------------------------------

Or by providing the path to the GCP credentials file location:

Provide authentication credentials to your application code by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` :

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------------
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json"
--------------------------------------------------------


== URI Format

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------------
google-storage://bucketNameOrArn?[options]
--------------------------------------------------------

By default the bucket will be created if it don't already exists. +
You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

For example in order to read file `hello.txt` from bucket `myCamelBucket`, use the following snippet:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json&objectName=hello.txt")
  .to("file:/var/downloaded");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== URI Options

// component options: START
The Google Storage component supports 16 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoCreateBucket* (common) | Setting the autocreation of the bucket bucketName. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (common) | The component configuration |  | GoogleCloudStorageConfiguration
| *serviceAccountKey* (common) | The Service account key that can be used as credentials for the Storage client. It can be loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. |  | String
| *storageClass* (common) | The Cloud Storage class to use when creating the new buckets | STANDARD | StorageClass
| *storageClient* (common) | *Autowired* The storage client |  | Storage
| *storageLocation* (common) | The Cloud Storage location to use when creating the new buckets | US-EAST1 | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *deleteAfterRead* (consumer) | Delete objects from the bucket after they have been retrieved. The delete is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not deleted. If this option is false, then the same objects will be retrieve over and over again on the polls. | true | boolean
| *destinationBucket* (consumer) | Define the destination bucket where an object must be moved when moveAfterRead is set to true. |  | String
| *includeBody* (consumer) | If it is true, the Object exchange will be consumed and put into the body. If false the Object stream will be put raw into the body and the headers will be set with the object metadata. | true | boolean
| *includeFolders* (consumer) | If it is true, the folders/directories will be consumed. If it is false, they will be ignored, and Exchanges will not be created for those | true | boolean
| *moveAfterRead* (consumer) | Move objects from the origin bucket to a different bucket after they have been retrieved. To accomplish the operation the destinationBucket option must be set. The copy bucket operation is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not moved. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *objectName* (producer) | The Object name inside the bucket |  | String
| *operation* (producer) | Set the operation for the producer. There are 7 enums and the value can be one of: copyObject, listObjects, deleteObject, deleteBucket, listBuckets, getObject, createDownloadLink |  | GoogleCloudStorageOperations
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

=== Google Storage Producer operations

Google Storage component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- copyObject
- listObjects
- deleteObject
- deleteBucket
- listBuckets
- getObject
- createDownloadLink

If you don't specify an operation explicitly the producer will a file upload.

=== Advanced component configuration

If you need to have more control over the `storageClient` instance configuration, you can create your own instance and refer to it in your Camel google-storage component configuration:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("google-storage://myCamelBucket?storageClient=#client")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Google Storage Producer Operation examples

- File Upload: This operation will upload a file to the Google Storage based on the body content

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//upload a file
byte[] payload = "Camel rocks!".getBytes();
ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(payload);
from("direct:start")
.process( exchange -> {
    exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.OBJECT_NAME, "camel.txt");
    exchange.getIn().setBody(bais);    
})
.to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json")
.log("uploaded file object:${header.CamelGoogleCloudStorageObjectName}, body:${body}");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will upload the file camel.txt with the content "Camel rocks!" in the myCamelBucket bucket

- CopyObject: this operation copy an object from one bucket to a different one

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process( exchange -> {
    exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.OPERATION, GoogleCloudStorageOperations.copyObject);
    exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.OBJECT_NAME, "camel.txt" );
    exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME, "myCamelBucket_dest");
    exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.DESTINATION_OBJECT_NAME, "camel_copy.txt");
  })
  .to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will copy the object with the name expressed in the header DESTINATION_OBJECT_NAME to the DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME bucket, from the bucket myCamelBucket.

- DeleteObject: this operation deletes an object from a bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process( exchange -> {
    exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.OPERATION, GoogleCloudStorageOperations.deleteObject);
    exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.OBJECT_NAME, "camel.txt" );
  })
  .to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will delete the object from the bucket myCamelBucket.

- ListBuckets: this operation list the buckets for this account in this region

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json&operation=listBuckets")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will list the buckets for this account.

- DeleteBucket: this operation delete the bucket specified as URI parameter or header

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json&operation=deleteBucket")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will delete the bucket myCamelBucket.

- ListObjects: this operation list object in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json&operation=listObjects")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will list the objects in the myCamelBucket bucket.

- GetObject: this operation get a single object in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.process( exchange -> {
  exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.OBJECT_NAME, "camel.txt");
})
.to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json&operation=getObject")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will return an Blob objct instance related to the OBJECT_NAME object in myCamelBucket bucket.

- CreateDownloadLink: this operation will return a download link

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.process( exchange -> {
  exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.OBJECT_NAME, "camel.txt" );
  exchange.getIn().setHeader(GoogleCloudStorageConstants.DOWNLOAD_LINK_EXPIRATION_TIME, 86400000L); //1 day
})
.to("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json&operation=createDownloadLink")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will return a download link url for the file OBJECT_NAME in the bucket myCamelBucket. It's possible to specify the expiration time for the created link through the header DOWNLOAD_LINK_EXPIRATION_TIME. If not specified, by default it is 5 minutes.

== Bucket Autocreation

With the option `autoCreateBucket` users are able to avoid the autocreation of a Bucket in case it doesn't exist. The default for this option is `true`.
If set to false any operation on a not-existent bucket won't be successful and an error will be returned.

== MoveAfterRead consumer option

In addition to deleteAfterRead it has been added another option, moveAfterRead. With this option enabled the consumed object will be moved to a target destinationBucket instead of being only deleted.
This will require specifying the destinationBucket option. As example:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountKey=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json"
    + "&autoCreateBucket=true"
    + "&destinationBucket=myCamelProcessedBucket"
    + "&moveAfterRead=true"
    + "&deleteAfterRead=true"
    + "&includeBody=true"
  )
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case the objects consumed will be moved to myCamelProcessedBucket bucket and deleted from the original one (because of deleteAfterRead).
