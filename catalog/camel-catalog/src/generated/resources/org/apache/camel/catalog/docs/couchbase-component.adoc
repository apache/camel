*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The *couchbase:* component allows you to treat
https://www.couchbase.com/[CouchBase] instances as a producer or consumer
of messages.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-couchbase</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== Options

// component options: START
The Couchbase component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The Couchbase endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
couchbase:protocol:hostname:port
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (3 parameters):

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *protocol* | *Required* The protocol to use |  | String
| *hostname* | *Required* The hostname to use |  | String
| *port* | The port number to use | 8091 | int
|===


=== Query Parameters (46 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type

| *collection* (common) | The collection to use |  | String
| *key* (common) | The key to use |  | String
| *scope* (common) | The scope to use |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *consumerProcessedStrategy* (consumer) | Define the consumer Processed strategy to use | none | String
| *descending* (consumer) | Define if this operation is descending or not | false | boolean
| *designDocumentName* (consumer) | The design document name to use | beer | String
| *fullDocument* (consumer) | If true consumer will return complete document instead data defined in view | false | boolean
| *limit* (consumer) | The output limit to use | -1 | int
| *rangeEndKey* (consumer) | Define a range for the end key |  | String
| *rangeStartKey* (consumer) | Define a range for the start key |  | String
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *skip* (consumer) | Define the skip to use | -1 | int
| *viewName* (consumer) | The view name to use | brewery_beers | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *autoStartIdForInserts* (producer) | Define if we want an autostart Id when we are doing an insert operation | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to do | CCB_PUT | String
| *persistTo* (producer) | Where to persist the data | 0 | int

| *connectTimeout* (advanced) | Define the timeoutconnect in milliseconds | 2500 | long
| *queryTimeout* (advanced) | Define the operation timeout in milliseconds | 2500 | long
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. There are 6 enums and the value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel

== Couchbase SDK compatibility
Using collections and scopes is supported only for Couchbase Enterprise Server 6.5+.

This component is currently using Java SDK 3.x so it might be not compatible with older Couchbase servers anymore. See the compatibility https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/project-docs/compatibility.html[page].

 * The value formerly interpreted as a bucket-name is now interpreted as a username. The username must correspond to a user defined on the cluster that is being accessed.
 * The value formerly interpreted as a bucket-password is now interpreted as the password of the defined user.
