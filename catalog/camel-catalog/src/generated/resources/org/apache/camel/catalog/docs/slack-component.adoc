*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Slack component allows you to connect to an instance
of http://www.slack.com/[Slack] and delivers a message contained in the
message body via a pre
established https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks[Slack incoming
webhook].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-slack</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

To send a message to a channel.

[source,java]
------------------------
slack:#channel[?options]
------------------------

To send a direct message to a slackuser.

[source,java]
-------------------------
slack:@userID[?options]
-------------------------

== Options



// component options: START
The Slack component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *token* (token) | The token to use |  | String
| *webhookUrl* (webhook) | The incoming webhook URL |  | String
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The Slack endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
slack:channel
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *channel* | *Required* The channel name (syntax #name) or slackuser (syntax userName) to send a message directly to an user. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (29 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *token* (common) | The token to use |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *conversationType* (consumer) | Type of conversation. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of: PUBLIC_CHANNEL, PRIVATE_CHANNEL, MPIM, IM | PUBLIC_CHANNEL | ConversationType

| *naturalOrder* (consumer) | Create exchanges in natural order (oldest to newest) or not | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *serverUrl* (consumer) | The Server URL of the Slack instance | https://slack.com | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy

| *iconUrl* (producer) | *Deprecated* The avatar that the component will use when sending message to a channel or user. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *username* (producer) | *Deprecated* This is the username that the bot will have when sending messages to a channel or user. |  | String
| *webhookUrl* (producer) | The incoming webhook URL |  | String

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. There are 6 enums and the value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel

== SlackComponent

The SlackComponent with XML must be configured as a Spring or Blueprint
bean that contains the incoming webhook url or the app token for the integration as a
parameter.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="slack" class="org.apache.camel.component.slack.SlackComponent">
    <property name="webhookUrl" value="https://hooks.slack.com/services/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"/>
    <property name="token" value="xoxb-12345678901-1234567890123-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"/>
</bean>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Java you can configure this using Java code.

== Example

A CamelContext with Blueprint could be as:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0" default-activation="lazy">

    <bean id="slack" class="org.apache.camel.component.slack.SlackComponent">
        <property name="webhookUrl" value="https://hooks.slack.com/services/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"/>
    </bean>

    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:test"/>
            <to uri="slack:#channel?iconEmoji=:camel:&amp;username=CamelTest"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>

</blueprint>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Producer

You can now use a token to send a message instead of WebhookUrl

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:test")
    .to("slack:#random?token=RAW(<YOUR_TOKEN>)");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can now use the Slack API model to create blocks. You can read more about it here https://api.slack.com/block-kit

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    public void testSlackAPIModelMessage() {
        Message message = new Message();
        message.setBlocks(Collections.singletonList(SectionBlock
                .builder()
                .text(MarkdownTextObject
                        .builder()
                        .text("*Hello from Camel!*")
                        .build())
                .build()));

        template.sendBody(test, message);
    }
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Consumer

You can use also a consumer for messages in channel

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("slack://general?token=RAW(<YOUR_TOKEN>)&maxResults=1")
    .to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll get the last message from general channel. The consumer will take track of the timestamp of the last message consumed and in the next poll it will check from that timestamp.

You'll need to create a Slack app and use it on your workspace.

Use the 'Bot User OAuth Access Token' as token for the consumer endpoint.

IMPORTANT: Add the corresponding history (`channels:history` or `groups:history` or `mpim:history` or `im:history`) and
read (`channels:read` or `groups:read` or `mpim:read` or `im:read`) user token scope to your app to grant it permission to
view messages in the corresponding channel. You will need to use the conversationType option to set it up too (`PUBLIC_CHANNEL`, `PRIVATE_CHANNEL`, `MPIM`, `IM`)

The naturalOrder option allows consuming messages from the oldest to the newest.
Originally you would get the newest first and consume backward (message 3 => message 2 => message 1)

IMPORTANT: You can use the conversationType option to read history and messages from a channel that is not only public
(`PUBLIC_CHANNEL`,`PRIVATE_CHANNEL`, `MPIM`, `IM`)
