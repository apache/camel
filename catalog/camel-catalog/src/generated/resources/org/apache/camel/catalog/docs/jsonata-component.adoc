*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Jsonata component allows you to process JSON messages using the
https://jsonata.org/[JSONATA] specification. This can be
ideal when doing JSON to JSON transformation and other transformations from JSON.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to
their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jsonata</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------
 

== URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------
jsonata:specName[?options]
-----------------------

Where *specName* is the classpath-local URI of the specification to
invoke; or the complete URL of the remote specification
(eg: \file://folder/myfile.vm).

You can append query options to the URI in the following
format, `?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options




// component options: START
The JSONATA component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The JSONATA endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
jsonata:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* Path to the resource. You can prefix with: classpath, file, http, ref, or bean. classpath, file and http loads the resource using these protocols (classpath is default). ref will lookup the resource in the registry. bean will call a method on a bean to be used as the resource. For bean you can specify the method name after dot, eg bean:myBean.myMethod. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (6 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *allowContextMapAll* (producer) | Sets whether the context map should allow access to all details. By default only the message body and headers can be accessed. This option can be enabled for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext. Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API. | false | boolean
| *contentCache* (producer) | Sets whether to use resource content cache or not | false | boolean
| *inputType* (producer) | Specifies if the output should be Jackson JsonNode or a JSON String. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: Jackson, JsonString | Jackson | JsonataInputOutputType
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *outputType* (producer) | Specifies if the output should be Jackson JsonNode or a JSON String. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: Jackson, JsonString | Jackson | JsonataInputOutputType
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END




== Samples

For example you could use something like

[source,java]
--------------------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("jsonata:com/acme/MyResponse.json");
--------------------------------------

And a file based resource:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("jsonata:file://myfolder/MyResponse.json?contentCache=true").
  to("activemq:Another.Queue");
---------------------------------------------------------------
