== URI Options

// component options: START
The Etcd Watch component supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *configuration* (consumer) | Component configuration. |  | EtcdConfiguration
| *recursive* (consumer) | To apply an action recursively. | false | boolean
| *servicePath* (consumer) | The path to look for for service discovery | /services/ | String
| *timeout* (consumer) | To set the maximum time an action could take to complete. |  | Long
| *uris* (common) | To set the URIs the client connects. | http://localhost:2379,http://localhost:4001 | String
| *sendEmptyExchangeOnTimeout* (consumer) | To send an empty message in case of timeout watching for a key. | false | boolean
| *fromIndex* (consumer) | The index to watch from | 0 | long
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *password* (security) | The password to use for basic authentication. |  | String
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters. |  | SSLContextParameters
| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean
| *userName* (security) | The user name to use for basic authentication. |  | String

| *timeout* (consumer) | To set the maximum time an action could take to complete. |  | Long
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *fromIndex* (consumer) | The index to watch from | 0 | long
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
