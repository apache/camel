*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Milo Server component provides an OPC UA server using the
http://eclipse.org/milo[Eclipse Miloâ„¢] implementation.

*Java 9+*: This component requires Java 9+ at runtime.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-milo</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Messages sent to the endpoint from Camel will be available from the OPC UA server to OPC UA Clients.
Value write requests from OPC UA Client will trigger messages which are sent into Apache Camel.


// component options: START
The OPC UA Server component supports 20 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *applicationName* (common) | The application name |  | String
| *applicationUri* (common) | The application URI |  | String
| *bindAddresses* (common) | Set the addresses of the local addresses the server should bind to |  | String
| *buildInfo* (common) | Server build info |  | BuildInfo
| *namespaceUri* (common) | The URI of the namespace, defaults to urn:org:apache:camel | urn:org:apache:camel | String
| *path* (common) | The path to be appended to the end of the endpoint url. (doesn't need to start with '/') |  | String
| *port* (common) | The TCP port the server binds to |  | int
| *productUri* (common) | The product URI |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *certificate* (security) | Server certificate |  | X509Certificate
| *certificateManager* (security) | Server certificate manager |  | CertificateManager
| *certificateValidator* (security) | Validator for client certificates |  | CertificateValidator
| *defaultCertificateValidator* (security) | Validator for client certificates using default file based approach |  | String
| *enableAnonymousAuthentication* (security) | Enable anonymous authentication, disabled by default | false | boolean
| *securityPolicies* (security) | Security policies |  | Set
| *securityPoliciesById* (security) | Security policies by URI or name. Multiple policies can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *userAuthenticationCredentials* (security) | Set user password combinations in the form of user1:pwd1,user2:pwd2 Usernames and passwords will be URL decoded |  | String
| *usernameSecurityPolicyUri* (security) | Set the UserTokenPolicy used when. There are 6 enums and the value can be one of: None, Basic128Rsa15, Basic256, Basic256Sha256, Aes128_Sha256_RsaOaep, Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss |  | SecurityPolicy

// endpoint options: START
The OPC UA Server endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
milo-server:itemId

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *itemId* | *Required* ID of the item |  | String

=== Query Parameters (5 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
