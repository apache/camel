= Camel Report Maven Plugin

The Camel Report Maven Plugin supports the following goals

 - camel-report:validate - To validate your source code for invalid Camel endpoint uris
 - camel-report:route-coverage - To report the coverage of your Camel routes after unit testing

== camel-report:validate

For validating the source code for mis-configured Camel:

- endpoint uris
- simple expressions or predicates
- duplicate route ids
- seda/direct endpoint pairs
- configuration in properties files

Then you can run the `validate` goal from the command line or from within your Java editor such as IDEA or Eclipse.

----
mvn camel-report:validate
----

You can also enable the plugin to run automatically as part of the build to catch these errors.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-report-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>process-classes</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>validate</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

The phase determines when the plugin runs. In the sample above the phase is `process-classes` which runs after
the compilation of the main source code.

The maven plugin can also be configured to validate the test source code , which means that the phase should be
changed accordingly to `process-test-classes` as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-report-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <configuration>
        <includeTest>true</includeTest>
      </configuration>
      <phase>process-test-classes</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>validate</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

=== Running the goal on any Maven project

You can also run the validate goal on any Maven project without having to add the plugin to the `pom.xml` file.
Doing so requires to specify the plugin using its fully qualified name. For example to run the goal on
the `camel-example-cdi` from Apache Camel you can run

----
$cd camel-example-cdi
$mvn org.apache.camel:camel-report-maven-plugin:2.20.0:validate
----

which then runs and outputs the following:

----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Building Camel :: Example :: CDI 3.0.0
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO]
[INFO] --- camel-report-maven-plugin:3.0.0:validate (default-cli) @ camel-example-cdi ---
[INFO] Endpoint validation success: (4 = passed, 0 = invalid, 0 = incapable, 0 = unknown components)
[INFO] Simple validation success: (0 = passed, 0 = invalid)
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

The validation passed, and 4 endpoints was validated. Now suppose we made a typo in one of the Camel endpoint uris in the source code, such as:

[source,java]
----
@Uri("timer:foo?period=5000")
----


is changed to include a typo error in the `period` option

[source,java]
----
@Uri("timer:foo?perid=5000")
----

And when running the `validate` goal again reports the following:

----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Building Camel :: Example :: CDI 3.0.0
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO]
[INFO] --- camel-report-maven-plugin:3.0.0:validate (default-cli) @ camel-example-cdi ---
[WARNING] Endpoint validation error at: org.apache.camel.example.cdi.MyRoutes(MyRoutes.java:32)

	timer:foo?perid=5000

	                   perid    Unknown option. Did you mean: [period]


[WARNING] Endpoint validation error: (3 = passed, 1 = invalid, 0 = incapable, 0 = unknown components)
[INFO] Simple validation success: (0 = passed, 0 = invalid)
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

=== Options

The maven plugin *validate* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| downloadVersion | true | Whether to allow downloading Camel catalog version from the internet. This is needed if the project uses a different Camel version than this plugin is using by default.
| failOnError | false | Whether to fail if invalid Camel endpoints was found. By default the plugin logs the errors at WARN level.
| coverageThreshold | 100 | The minimum route coverage in percent when using failOnError.
| overallCoverageThreshold | 0 | The minimum coverage across all routes in percent when using failOnError.
| logUnparseable | false | Whether to log endpoint URIs which was un-parsable and therefore not possible to validate.
| includeJava | true | Whether to include Java files to be validated for invalid Camel endpoints.
| includeXml | true | Whether to include XML files to be validated for invalid Camel endpoints.
| includeTest | false | Whether to include test source code.
| includes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to only include files matching any of the given list of patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| excludes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to exclude files matching any of the given list of patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| ignoreUnknownComponent | true | Whether to ignore unknown components.
| ignoreIncapable | true | Whether to ignore incapable of parsing the endpoint uri or simple expression.
| ignoreLenientProperties | true | Whether to ignore components that uses lenient properties. When this is true, then the uri validation is stricter but would fail on properties that are not part of the component but in the uri because of using lenient properties. For example using the HTTP components to provide query parameters in the endpoint uri.
| ignoreDeprecated | true |Whether to ignore deprecated options being used in the endpoint uri.
| duplicateRouteId | true |Whether to validate for duplicate route ids. Route ids should be unique and if there are duplicates then Camel will fail to startup.
| directOrSedaPairCheck | true |Whether to validate direct/seda endpoints sending to non existing consumers.
| configurationFiles | application.properties | Location of configuration files to validate. The default is application.properties. Multiple values can be separated by comma and use wildcard pattern matching.
| showAll | false | Whether to show all endpoints and simple expressions (both invalid and valid).
|===

For example to turn on ignoring usage of deprecated options from the command line, you can run:

----
$mvn camel-report:validate -Dcamel.ignoreDeprecated=true
----

Notice that you must prefix the `-D` command argument with `camel.`, eg `camel.ignoreDeprecated` as the option name.

=== Validating include test

If you have a Maven project then you can run the plugin to validate the endpoints in the unit test source code as well.
You can pass in the options using `-D` style as shown:

----
$cd myproject
$mvn org.apache.camel:camel-report-maven-plugin:3.0.0:validate -Dcamel.includeTest=true
----


== camel-report:route-coverage

For generating a report of the coverage of your Camel routes from unit testing.
In the same manner you can generate Java code coverage reports, then this is the same but for Camel routes.
You can therefore use this to know which parts of your Camel routes have been used or not.

Camel uses JMX to capture metrics during tests which are used for calculating route coverage.
You must have `camel-management` JAR on the classpath (can be test scoped)
such as by declaring the following Maven dependency in your pom.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- JMX is needed for route coverage testing -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-management</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Enabling route coverage

You can enable route coverage while running unit tests either by:

- setting global JVM system property enabling for all test classes
- using `@EnableRouteCoverage` annotation per test class if using `camel-test-spring-junit5` module
- overriding `isDumpRouteCoverage` method per test class if using `camel-test` module

==== Enabling via JVM system property

You can turn on the JVM system property `CamelTestRouteCoverage` to enable route coverage for all tests cases.
This can be done either in the configuration of the `maven-surefire-plugin`:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <systemPropertyVariables>
      <CamelTestRouteCoverage>true</CamelTestRouteCoverage>
    </systemPropertyVariables>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Or from the command line when running tests:

----
mvn clean test -DCamelTestRouteCoverage=true
----

==== Enabling via @EnableRouteCoverage annotation

You need to enable route coverage in the unit tests classes. You can do this by adding the `@EnableRouteCoverage`
annotation to the test class if you are testing using `camel-test-spring-junit5`:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(CamelSpringBootRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SampleCamelApplication.class)
@EnableRouteCoverage
public class FooApplicationTest {
----

==== Enabling via isDumpRouteCoverage method

However if you are using `camel-test` and your unit tests are extending `CamelTestSupport` then you can
turn on route coverage as shown:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public boolean isDumpRouteCoverage() {
    return true;
}
----

Routes that can be route coveraged must have an unique id assigned, in other words you cannot use anonymous routes.

You do this using `routeId` in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:cheese").routeId("cheesy")
  .to("log:foo")
  ...
----

And in XML DSL you just assign the route id via the id attribute

[source,xml]
----
<route id="cheesy">
  <from uri="jms:queue:cheese"/>
  <to uri="log:foo"/>
  ...
</route>
----

=== Generating route coverage report

After unit testing with:

----
mvn test
----

You can then run the goal to report the route coverage

----
mvn camel-report:route-coverage
----

Which then reports which routes has missing route coverage with precise source code line reporting:

----
[INFO] --- camel-camel-report-plugin:3.0.0:route-coverage (default-cli) @ camel-example-spring-boot-xml ---
[INFO] Discovered 1 routes
[INFO] Route coverage summary:

File:	src/main/resources/my-camel.xml
RouteId:	hello

  Line #      Count   Route
  ------      -----   -----
      28          1   from
      29          1     transform
      32          1     filter
      34          0       to
      36          1     to

Coverage: 4 out of 5 (80.0%)
----

Here we can see that the 2nd last line with `to` has `0` in the count column, and therefore is not covered.
We can also see that this is one line 34 in the source code file, which is in the `my-camel.xml` XML file.

=== Options

The maven plugin *coverage* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax),
 or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| failOnError | false | Whether to fail if any of the routes has not 100% coverage.
| includeTest | false | Whether to include test source code.
| includes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to only include files matching any of the given list of
 patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| excludes | | To filter the names of java and xml files to exclude files matching any of the given list of
 patterns (wildcard and regular expression). Multiple values can be separated by comma.
| anonymousRoutes | false | Whether to allow anonymous routes (routes without any route id assigned).
 By using route id's then its safer to match the route cover data with the route source code.
 Anonymous routes are less safe to use for route coverage as its harder to know exactly which route
 that was tested corresponds to which of the routes from the source code.
| generateJacocoXmlReport | false | Whether to generate a coverage-report in Jacoco XML format. When enabled it will generate the file: `target/site/jacoco/xmlJacoco.xml`
| generateHtmlReport | false | Whether to generate a coverage-report in HTML format. When enabled it will generate the file: `target/site/route-coverage/html/index.html`
