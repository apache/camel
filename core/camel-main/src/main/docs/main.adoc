*Since Camel {since}*

This module is used for running Camel standalone via a main class extended from `camel-main`.

== Configuration options

When running Camel via `camel-main` you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

The following tables lists all the options:

// main options: START
=== Camel Main configurations
The camel.main supports 118 options, which are listed below.

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.main.allowUseOriginal{zwsp}Message* | Sets whether to allow access to the original message from Camel's error handler, or from org.apache.camel.spi.UnitOfWork.getOriginalInMessage(). Turning this off can optimize performance, as defensive copy of the original message is not needed. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}Enabled* | Whether auto configuration of components, dataformats, languages is enabled or not. When enabled the configuration parameters are loaded from the properties component. You can prefix the parameters in the properties file with: - camel.component.name.option1=value1 - camel.component.name.option2=value2 - camel.dataformat.name.option1=value1 - camel.dataformat.name.option2=value2 - camel.language.name.option1=value1 - camel.language.name.option2=value2 Where name is the name of the component, dataformat or language such as seda,direct,jaxb. The auto configuration also works for any options on components that is a complex type (not standard Java type) and there has been an explicit single bean instance registered to the Camel registry via the org.apache.camel.spi.Registry#bind(String,Object) method or by using the org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry annotation style. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}EnvironmentVariablesEnabled* | Whether auto configuration should include OS environment variables as well. When enabled this allows to overrule any configuration using an OS environment variable. For example to set a shutdown timeout of 5 seconds: CAMEL_MAIN_SHUTDOWNTIMEOUT=5. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}FailFast* | Whether auto configuration should fail fast when configuring one ore more properties fails for whatever reason such as a invalid property name, etc. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}LogSummary* | Whether auto configuration should log a summary with the configured properties. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}SystemPropertiesEnabled* | Whether auto configuration should include JVM system properties as well. When enabled this allows to overrule any configuration using a JVM system property. For example to set a shutdown timeout of 5 seconds: -D camel.main.shutdown-timeout=5. Note that JVM system properties take precedence over OS environment variables. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoStartup* | Sets whether the object should automatically start when Camel starts. Important: Currently only routes can be disabled, as CamelContext's are always started. Note: When setting auto startup false on CamelContext then that takes precedence and no routes are started. You would need to start CamelContext explicit using the org.apache.camel.CamelContext.start() method, to start the context, and then you would need to start the routes manually using CamelContext.getRouteController().startRoute(String). Default is true to always start up. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. Default is true. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.backlogTracing* | Sets whether backlog tracing is enabled or not. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.basePackageScan* | Package name to use as base (offset) for classpath scanning of RouteBuilder , and org.apache.camel.TypeConverter classes. If you are using Spring Boot then it is instead recommended to use Spring Boots component scanning and annotate your route builder classes with Component. In other words only use this for Camel Main in standalone mode. |  | String
| *camel.main.basePackageScan{zwsp}Enabled* | Whether base package scan is enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.beanIntrospection{zwsp}ExtendedStatistics* | Sets whether bean introspection uses extended statistics. The default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.beanIntrospection{zwsp}LoggingLevel* | Sets the logging level used by bean introspection, logging activity of its usage. The default is TRACE. |  | LoggingLevel
| *camel.main.beanPostProcessor{zwsp}Enabled* | Can be used to turn off bean post processing. Be careful to turn this off, as this means that beans that use Camel annotations such as org.apache.camel.EndpointInject , org.apache.camel.ProducerTemplate , org.apache.camel.Produce , org.apache.camel.Consume etc will not be injected and in use. Turning this off should only be done if you are sure you do not use any of these Camel features. Not all runtimes allow turning this off (such as camel-blueprint or camel-cdi with XML). The default value is true (enabled). | true | boolean
| *camel.main.camelEvents{zwsp}TimestampEnabled* | Whether to include timestamps for all emitted Camel Events. Enabling this allows to know fine-grained at what time each event was emitted, which can be used for reporting to report exactly the time of the events. This is by default false to avoid the overhead of including this information. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.caseInsensitive{zwsp}Headers* | Whether to use case sensitive or insensitive headers. Important: When using case sensitive (this is set to false). Then the map is case sensitive which means headers such as content-type and Content-Type are two different keys which can be a problem for some protocols such as HTTP based, which rely on case insensitive headers. However case sensitive implementations can yield faster performance. Therefore use case sensitive implementation with care. Default is true. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.configuration{zwsp}Classes* | Sets classes names that will be used to configure the camel context as example by providing custom beans through org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry annotation. |  | String
| *camel.main.configurations* | Sets the configuration objects used to configure the camel context. |  | List
| *camel.main.consumerTemplate{zwsp}CacheSize* | Consumer template endpoints cache size. | 1000 | int
| *camel.main.contextReload{zwsp}Enabled* | Used for enabling context reloading. If enabled then Camel allow external systems such as security vaults (AWS secrets manager, etc.) to trigger refreshing Camel by updating property placeholders and reload all existing routes to take changes into effect. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.debugging* | Sets whether debugging is enabled or not. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.description* | Sets the description (intended for humans) of the Camel application. |  | String
| *camel.main.devConsoleEnabled* | Whether to enable developer console (requires camel-console on classpath). The developer console is only for assisting during development. This is NOT for production usage. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.dumpRoutes* | If dumping is enabled then Camel will during startup dump all loaded routes (incl rests and route templates) represented as XML DSL into the log. This is intended for trouble shooting or to assist during development. Sensitive information that may be configured in the route endpoints could potentially be included in the dump output and is therefore not recommended being used for production usage. This requires to have camel-xml-jaxb on the classpath to be able to dump the routes as XML. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.durationHitExitCode* | Sets the exit code for the application if duration was hit |  | int
| *camel.main.durationMaxAction* | Controls whether the Camel application should shutdown the JVM, or stop all routes, when duration max is triggered. | shutdown | String

| *camel.main.durationMaxMessages* | To specify how many messages to process by Camel before automatic terminating the JVM. You can use this to run Camel for a short while. |  | int
| *camel.main.durationMaxSeconds* | To specify for how long time in seconds to keep running the JVM before automatic terminating the JVM. You can use this to run Camel for a short while. |  | int
| *camel.main.endpointBridgeError{zwsp}Handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored. The default value is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.endpointLazyStart{zwsp}Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. The default value is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.endpointRuntime{zwsp}StatisticsEnabled* | Sets whether endpoint runtime statistics is enabled (gathers runtime usage of each incoming and outgoing endpoints). The default value is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.exchangeFactory* | Controls whether to pool (reuse) exchanges or create new exchanges (prototype). Using pooled will reduce JVM garbage collection overhead by avoiding to re-create Exchange instances per message each consumer receives. The default is prototype mode. | default | String
| *camel.main.exchangeFactory{zwsp}Capacity* | The capacity the pool (for each consumer) uses for storing exchanges. The default capacity is 100. | 100 | int
| *camel.main.exchangeFactory{zwsp}StatisticsEnabled* | Configures whether statistics is enabled on exchange factory. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.extraShutdown{zwsp}Timeout* | Extra timeout in seconds to graceful shutdown Camel. When Camel is shutting down then Camel first shutdown all the routes (shutdownTimeout). Then additional services is shutdown (extraShutdownTimeout). | 15 | int
| *camel.main.fileConfigurations* | Directory to load additional configuration files that contains configuration values that takes precedence over any other configuration. This can be used to refer to files that may have secret configuration that has been mounted on the file system for containers. You can specify a pattern to load from sub directories and a name pattern such as /var/app/secret/.properties, multiple directories can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *camel.main.globalOptions* | Sets global options that can be referenced in the camel context Important: This has nothing to do with property placeholders, and is just a plain set of key/value pairs which are used to configure global options on CamelContext, such as a maximum debug logging length etc. |  | Map
| *camel.main.inflightRepository{zwsp}BrowseEnabled* | Sets whether the inflight repository should allow browsing each inflight exchange. This is by default disabled as there is a very slight performance overhead when enabled. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.javaRoutesExclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for exclusive filtering RouteBuilder classes which are collected from the registry or via classpath scanning. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma. For example to exclude all classes starting with Bar use: &#42;&#42;/Bar&#42; To exclude all routes form a specific package use: com/mycompany/bar/&#42; To exclude all routes form a specific package and its sub-packages use double wildcards: com/mycompany/bar/&#42;&#42; And to exclude all routes from two specific packages use: com/mycompany/bar/&#42;,com/mycompany/stuff/&#42; |  | String
| *camel.main.javaRoutesInclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for inclusive filtering RouteBuilder classes which are collected from the registry or via classpath scanning.

| *camel.main.jmxManagement{zwsp}StatisticsLevel* | Sets the JMX statistics level, the level can be set to Extended to gather additional information The default value is Default. | Default | ManagementStatisticsLevel
| *camel.main.lightweight* | Configure the context to be lightweight. This will trigger some optimizations and memory reduction options. Lightweight context have some limitations. At this moment, dynamic endpoint destinations are not supported. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.loadHealthChecks* | Whether to load custom health checks by scanning classpath. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.loadStatistics{zwsp}Enabled* | Sets whether context load statistics is enabled (something like the unix load average). The statistics requires to have camel-management on the classpath as JMX is required. The default value is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.loadTypeConverters* | Whether to load custom type converters by scanning classpath. This is used for backwards compatibility with Camel 2.x. Its recommended to migrate to use fast type converter loading by setting Converter(loader = true) on your custom type converter classes. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.logDebugMaxChars* | Is used to limit the maximum length of the logging Camel message bodies. If the message body is longer than the limit, the log message is clipped. Use -1 to have unlimited length. Use for example 1000 to log at most 1000 characters. |  | int
| *camel.main.logExhaustedMessage{zwsp}Body* | Sets whether to log exhausted message body with message history. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.logMask* | Sets whether log mask is enabled or not. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.mdcLoggingKeys{zwsp}Pattern* | Sets the pattern used for determine which custom MDC keys to propagate during message routing when the routing engine continues routing asynchronously for the given message. Setting this pattern to will propagate all custom keys. Or setting the pattern to foo,bar will propagate any keys starting with either foo or bar. Notice that a set of standard Camel MDC keys are always propagated which starts with camel. as key name. The match rules are applied in this order (case insensitive): 1. exact match, returns true 2. wildcard match (pattern ends with a and the name starts with the pattern), returns true 3. regular expression match, returns true 4. otherwise returns false |  | String
| *camel.main.messageHistory* | Sets whether message history is enabled or not. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.modeline* | Whether camel-k style modeline is also enabled when not using camel-k. Enabling this allows to use a camel-k like experience by being able to configure various settings using modeline directly in your route source code. | false | boolean

| *camel.main.producerTemplate{zwsp}CacheSize* | Producer template endpoints cache size. | 1000 | int
| *camel.main.routeControllerBack{zwsp}OffDelay* | Backoff delay in millis when restarting a route that failed to startup. |  | long
| *camel.main.routeControllerBack{zwsp}OffMaxAttempts* | Backoff maximum number of attempts to restart a route that failed to startup. When this threshold has been exceeded then the controller will give up attempting to restart the route, and the route will remain as stopped. |  | long
| *camel.main.routeControllerBack{zwsp}OffMaxDelay* | Backoff maximum delay in millis when restarting a route that failed to startup. |  | long
| *camel.main.routeControllerBack{zwsp}OffMaxElapsedTime* | Backoff maximum elapsed time in millis, after which the backoff should be considered exhausted and no more attempts should be made. |  | long
| *camel.main.routeControllerBack{zwsp}OffMultiplier* | Backoff multiplier to use for exponential backoff. This is used to extend the delay between restart attempts. |  | double
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}ExcludeRoutes* | Pattern for filtering routes to be excluded as supervised. The pattern is matching on route id, and endpoint uri for the route. Multiple patterns can be separated by comma. For example to exclude all JMS routes, you can say jms:. And to exclude routes with specific route ids mySpecialRoute,myOtherSpecialRoute. The pattern supports wildcards and uses the matcher from org.apache.camel.support.PatternHelper#matchPattern. |  | String
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}IncludeRoutes* | Pattern for filtering routes to be included as supervised. The pattern is matching on route id, and endpoint uri for the route. Multiple patterns can be separated by comma. For example to include all kafka routes, you can say kafka:. And to include routes with specific route ids myRoute,myOtherRoute. The pattern supports wildcards and uses the matcher from org.apache.camel.support.PatternHelper#matchPattern. |  | String
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}InitialDelay* | Initial delay in milli seconds before the route controller starts, after CamelContext has been started. |  | long
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}LoggingLevel* | Sets the logging level used for logging route activity (such as starting and stopping routes). The default logging level is DEBUG. | DEBUG | LoggingLevel
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}SuperviseEnabled* | To enable using supervising route controller which allows Camel to startup and then the controller takes care of starting the routes in a safe manner. This can be used when you want to startup Camel despite a route may otherwise fail fast during startup and cause Camel to fail to startup as well. By delegating the route startup to the supervising route controller then its manages the startup using a background thread. The controller allows to be configured with various settings to attempt to restart failing routes. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}ThreadPoolSize* | The number of threads used by the route controller scheduled thread pool that are used for restarting routes.

| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}UnhealthyOnExhausted* | Whether to mark the route as unhealthy (down) when all restarting attempts (backoff) have failed and the route is not successfully started and the route manager is giving up. Setting this to true allows health checks to know about this and can report the Camel application as DOWN. The default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.routeFilterExclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for filtering routes routes matching the given pattern, which follows the following rules: - Match by route id - Match by route input endpoint uri The matching is using exact match, by wildcard and regular expression as documented by PatternHelper#matchPattern(String,String) . For example to only include routes which starts with foo in their route id's, use: include=foo&#42; And to exclude routes which starts from JMS endpoints, use: exclude=jms:&#42; Multiple patterns can be separated by comma, for example to exclude both foo and bar routes, use: exclude=foo&#42;,bar&#42; Exclude takes precedence over include. |  | String
| *camel.main.routeFilterInclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for filtering routes matching the given pattern, which follows the following rules: - Match by route id - Match by route input endpoint uri The matching is using exact match, by wildcard and regular expression as documented by PatternHelper#matchPattern(String,String) . For example to only include routes which starts with foo in their route id's, use: include=foo&#42; And to exclude routes which starts from JMS endpoints, use: exclude=jms:&#42; Multiple patterns can be separated by comma, for example to exclude both foo and bar routes, use: exclude=foo&#42;,bar&#42; Exclude takes precedence over include. |  | String
| *camel.main.routesBuilder{zwsp}Classes* | Sets classes names that implement RoutesBuilder . |  | String
| *camel.main.routesBuilders* | Sets the RoutesBuilder instances. |  | List
| *camel.main.routesCollector{zwsp}Enabled* | Whether the routes collector is enabled or not. When enabled Camel will auto-discover routes (RouteBuilder instances from the registry and also load additional routes from the file system). The routes collector is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.routesCompile{zwsp}Directory* | Directory to use for saving runtime compiled Camel routes to class files, when using camel-java-joor-dsl as Java DSL (such as when using Camel K with Java source routes). Camel will compile to in-memory only by default. Specifying this option, allows Camel to persist the compiled class to disk. And when starting the application again the routes are loaded from the pre-compiled class files instead of re-compiling again. |  | String
| *camel.main.routesCompileLoad{zwsp}First* | Whether to load preexisting compiled Camel routes class files, when using camel-java-joor-dsl as Java DSL (such as when using Camel K with Java source routes). If enabled then Camel will look in the routes compile directory if a compiled Java route already exists and load its bytecode instead of runtime compiling from its java source file. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.routesExclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for exclusive filtering of routes from directories. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma, as example, to exclude all the routes from a directory whose name contains foo use: &#42;&#42;/foo. |  | String
| *camel.main.routesInclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for inclusive filtering of routes from directories. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma, as example, to include all the routes from a directory whose name contains foo use: &#42;&#42;/foo. | classpath:camel/*,classpath:camel-template/*,classpath:camel-rest/* | String
| *camel.main.routesReload{zwsp}Directory* | Directory to scan for route changes. Camel cannot scan the classpath, so this must be configured to a file directory. Development with Maven as build tool, you can configure the directory to be src/main/resources to scan for Camel routes in XML or YAML files. | src/main/resources/camel | String
| *camel.main.routesReload{zwsp}DirectoryRecursive* | Whether the directory to scan should include sub directories. Depending on the number of sub directories, then this can cause the JVM to startup slower as Camel uses the JDK file-watch service to scan for file changes. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.routesReloadEnabled* | Used for enabling automatic routes reloading. If enabled then Camel will watch for file changes in the given reload directory, and trigger reloading routes if files are changed. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.routesReloadPattern* | Used for inclusive filtering of routes from directories. Typical used for specifying to accept routes in XML or YAML files, such as .yaml,.xml. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma. |  | String
| *camel.main.routesReloadRemove{zwsp}AllRoutes* | When reloading routes should all existing routes be stopped and removed. By default, Camel will stop and remove all existing routes before reloading routes. This ensures that only the reloaded routes will be active. If disabled then only routes with the same route id is updated, and any existing routes are continued to run. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.routesReloadRestart{zwsp}Duration* | Whether to restart max duration when routes are reloaded. For example if max duration is 60 seconds, and a route is reloaded after 25 seconds, then this will restart the count and wait 60 seconds again. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.shutdownLogInflight{zwsp}ExchangesOnTimeout* | Sets whether to log information about the inflight Exchanges which are still running during a shutdown which didn't complete without the given timeout. This requires to enable the option inflightRepositoryBrowseEnabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.shutdownNowOn{zwsp}Timeout* | Sets whether to force shutdown of all consumers when a timeout occurred and thus not all consumers was shutdown within that period. You should have good reasons to set this option to false as it means that the routes keep running and is halted abruptly when CamelContext has been shutdown. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.shutdownRoutesIn{zwsp}ReverseOrder* | Sets whether routes should be shutdown in reverse or the same order as they were started. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.shutdownSuppress{zwsp}LoggingOnTimeout* | Whether Camel should try to suppress logging during shutdown and timeout was triggered, meaning forced shutdown is happening. And during forced shutdown we want to avoid logging errors/warnings et all in the logs as a side-effect of the forced timeout. Notice the suppress is a best effort as there may still be some logs coming from 3rd party libraries and whatnot, which Camel cannot control. This option is default false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.shutdownTimeout* | Timeout in seconds to graceful shutdown all the Camel routes. | 45 | int
| *camel.main.sourceLocation{zwsp}Enabled* | Whether to capture precise source location:line-number for all EIPs in Camel routes. Enabling this will impact parsing Java based routes (also Groovy, Kotlin, etc.) on startup as this uses JDK StackTraceElement to calculate the location from the Camel route, which comes with a performance cost. This only impact startup, not the performance of the routes at runtime. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.startupRecorder* | To use startup recorder for capturing execution time during starting Camel. The recorder can be one of: false (or off), logging, java-flight-recorder (or jfr). |  | String
| *camel.main.startupRecorderDir* | Directory to store the recording. By default the current directory will be used. Use false to turn off saving recording to disk. |  | String
| *camel.main.startupRecorder{zwsp}Duration* | How long time to run the startup recorder. Use 0 (default) to keep the recorder running until the JVM is exited. Use -1 to stop the recorder right after Camel has been started (to only focus on potential Camel startup performance bottlenecks) Use a positive value to keep recording for N seconds. When the recorder is stopped then the recording is auto saved to disk (note: save to disk can be disabled by setting startupRecorderDir to false) |  | long
| *camel.main.startupRecorderMax{zwsp}Depth* | To filter our sub steps at a maximum depth. Use -1 for no maximum. Use 0 for no sub steps. Use 1 for max 1 sub step, and so forth. The default is -1. | -1 | int
| *camel.main.startupRecorder{zwsp}Profile* | To use a specific Java Flight Recorder profile configuration, such as default or profile. The default is default. | default | String
| *camel.main.startupRecorder{zwsp}Recording* | To enable Java Flight Recorder to start a recording and automatic dump the recording to disk after startup is complete. This requires that camel-jfr is on the classpath, and to enable this option. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.startupSummaryLevel* | Controls the level of information logged during startup (and shutdown) of CamelContext. | Default | StartupSummaryLevel
| *camel.main.streamCachingAny{zwsp}SpoolRules* | Sets whether if just any of the org.apache.camel.spi.StreamCachingStrategy.SpoolRule rules returns true then shouldSpoolCache(long) returns true, to allow spooling to disk. If this option is false, then all the org.apache.camel.spi.StreamCachingStrategy.SpoolRule must return true. The default value is false which means that all the rules must return true. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.streamCachingBuffer{zwsp}Size* | Sets the stream caching buffer size to use when allocating in-memory buffers used for in-memory stream caches. The default size is 4096. |  | int
| *camel.main.streamCaching{zwsp}Enabled* | Sets whether stream caching is enabled or not. While stream types (like StreamSource, InputStream and Reader) are commonly used in messaging for performance reasons, they also have an important drawback: they can only be read once. In order to be able to work with message content multiple times, the stream needs to be cached. Streams are cached in memory only (by default). If streamCachingSpoolEnabled=true, then, for large stream messages (over 128 KB by default) will be cached in a temporary file instead, and Camel will handle deleting the temporary file once the cached stream is no longer necessary. Default is true. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.streamCachingRemove{zwsp}SpoolDirectoryWhenStopping* | Whether to remove stream caching temporary directory when stopping. This option is default true. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.streamCachingSpool{zwsp}Cipher* | Sets a stream caching cipher name to use when spooling to disk to write with encryption. By default the data is not encrypted. |  | String
| *camel.main.streamCachingSpool{zwsp}Directory* | Sets the stream caching spool (temporary) directory to use for overflow and spooling to disk. If no spool directory has been explicit configured, then a temporary directory is created in the java.io.tmpdir directory. |  | String
| *camel.main.streamCachingSpool{zwsp}Enabled* | To enable stream caching spooling to disk. This means, for large stream messages (over 128 KB by default) will be cached in a temporary file instead, and Camel will handle deleting the temporary file once the cached stream is no longer necessary. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.streamCachingSpool{zwsp}Threshold* | Stream caching threshold in bytes when overflow to disk is activated. The default threshold is 128kb. Use -1 to disable overflow to disk. |  | long
| *camel.main.streamCachingSpool{zwsp}UsedHeapMemoryLimit* | Sets what the upper bounds should be when streamCachingSpoolUsedHeapMemoryThreshold is in use. |  | String
| *camel.main.streamCachingSpool{zwsp}UsedHeapMemoryThreshold* | Sets a percentage (1-99) of used heap memory threshold to activate stream caching spooling to disk. |  | int
| *camel.main.streamCaching{zwsp}StatisticsEnabled* | Sets whether stream caching statistics is enabled. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.threadNamePattern* | Sets the thread name pattern used for creating the full thread name. The default pattern is: Camel (#camelId#) thread ##counter# - #name# Where #camelId# is the name of the CamelContext. and #counter# is a unique incrementing counter. and #name# is the regular thread name. You can also use #longName# which is the long thread name which can includes endpoint parameters etc. |  | String
| *camel.main.tracing* | Sets whether tracing is enabled or not. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *camel.main.tracingLogging{zwsp}Format* | To use a custom tracing logging format. The default format (arrow, routeId, label) is: %-4.4s %-12.12s %-33.33s | %-4.4s [%-12.12s] [%-33.33s] | String
| *camel.main.tracingPattern* | Tracing pattern to match which node EIPs to trace. For example to match all To EIP nodes, use to. The pattern matches by node and route id's Multiple patterns can be separated by comma. |  | String

=== Camel Health Check configurations
The camel.health supports 8 options, which are listed below.

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.health.componentsEnabled* | Whether components health check is enabled | true | Boolean
| *camel.health.consumersEnabled* | Whether consumers health check is enabled | true | Boolean
| *camel.health.enabled* | Whether health check is enabled globally | true | Boolean
| *camel.health.excludePattern* | Pattern to exclude health checks from being invoked by Camel when checking healths. Multiple patterns can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *camel.health.exposureLevel* | Sets the level of details to exposure as result of invoking health checks. There are the following levels: full, default, oneline The full level will include all details and status from all the invoked health checks. The default level will report UP if everything is okay, and only include detailed information for health checks that was DOWN. The oneline level will only report either UP or DOWN. | default | String
| *camel.health.initialState* | The initial state of health-checks (readiness). There are the following states: UP, DOWN, UNKNOWN. By default, the state is DOWN, is regarded as being pessimistic/careful. This means that the overall health checks may report as DOWN during startup and then only if everything is up and running flip to being UP. Setting the initial state to UP, is regarded as being optimistic. This means that the overall health checks may report as UP during startup and then if a consumer or other service is in fact un-healthy, then the health-checks can flip being DOWN. Setting the state to UNKNOWN means that some health-check would be reported in unknown state, especially during early bootstrap where a consumer may not be fully initialized or validated a connection to a remote system. This option allows to pre-configure the state for different modes. | down | String

== Package Scanning

*Available since Camel 3.16*

When running Camel standalone via `camel-main` JAR, then Camel will use package scanning to discover:

- Camel routes by discovering `RouteBuilder` classes
- Camel configuration classes by discovering `CamelConfiguration` classes or classes annotated with `@Configuration`.
- Camel type converters by discovering classes annotated with `@Converter`

To use package scanning then Camel needs to know the base package to use as _offset_. This
can be specified either with the `camel.main.basePackage` option or via `Main` class as shown below:

[source,java]
----
package com.foo.acme;

public class MyCoolApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main main = new Main(MyCoolApplication.class);
        main.run();
    }

}
----

In the example above, then we use `com.foo.acme` as the base package, which is done
by passing in the class in the `Main` constructor. This is similar with how Spring Boot does this.

Camel will then scan from the base package and the sub packages.

=== Disabling Package Scanning

Package scanning can be turned off by setting `camel.main.basePackageScanEnabled=false`.

There is a little overhead when using package scanning as Camel performs this scan during startup.

== Configuring Camel Main applications

You can use _configuration_ classes to configure Camel Main applications from Java.

IMPORTANT: In *Camel 3.16* onwards the configuration classes must either implement the interface `org.apache.camel.CamelConfiguration`,
or be annotated with `@Configuration` (or both). In previous versions this was not required.

For example to configure a Camel application by creating custom beans you can do:

[source,java]
----
public class MyConfiguration implements CamelConfiguration {

    @BindToRegistry
    public MyBean myAwesomeBean() {
        MyBean bean = new MyBean();
        // do something on bean
        return bean;
    }

    public void configure(CamelContext camelContext) throws Exception {
        // this method is optional and can be omitted
        // do any kind of configuration here if needed
    }

}
----

In the configuration class you can also have custom methods that creates beans, such as the `myAwesomeBean` method
that creates the `MyBean` and registers it with the name `myAwesomeBean` (defaults to method name).

This is similar to Spring Boot where you can also do this with the Spring Boot `@Bean` annotations,
or in Quarkus/CDI with the `@Produces` annotation.

=== Using annotation based configuration classes

Instead of configuration classes that implements `CamelConfiguration`, you can annotate the class with `org.apache.camel.@Configuration` as shown:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @BindToRegistry
    public MyBean myAwesomeBean() {
        MyBean bean = new MyBean();
        // do something on bean
        return bean;
    }
}
----

== Specifying custom beans

Custom beans can be configured in `camel-main` via properties (such as in the `application.properties` file).

For example to create a `DataSource` for a Postgress database, you can create a new bean instance via `#class:` with the class name (fully qualified).
Properties on the data source can then additional configured such as the server and database name, etc.

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.myDS = #class:org.postgresql.jdbc3.Jdbc3PoolingDataSource
camel.beans.myDS.dataSourceName = myDS
camel.beans.myDS.serverName = mypostrgress
camel.beans.myDS.databaseName = test
camel.beans.myDS.user = testuser
camel.beans.myDS.password = testpassword
camel.beans.myDS.maxConnections = 10
----

The bean is registered in the Camel Registry with the name `myDS`.

If you use the SQL component then the datasource can be configured on the SQL component:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #myDS
----

To refer to a custom bean you may want to favour using `#bean:` style, as this states the intention more clearly that its referring to a bean,
and not just a text value that happens to start with a `+#+` sign:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #bean:myDS
----

=== Creating a custom map bean

When creating a bean as a `java.util.Map` type, then you can use the `[]` syntax as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.myApp[id] = 123
camel.beans.myApp[name] = Demo App
camel.beans.myApp[version] = 1.0.1
camel.beans.myApp[username] = goofy
----

Camel will then create this as a `LinkedHashMap` type with the name `myApp` which is
bound to the Camel xref:manual:ROOT:registry.adoc[Registry], with the data defined in the properties.

If you desire a different `java.util.Map` implementation, then you can use `#class` style as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.myApp = #class:com.foo.MyMapImplementation
camel.beans.myApp[id] = 123
camel.beans.myApp[name] = Demo App
camel.beans.myApp[version] = 1.0.1
camel.beans.myApp[username] = goofy
----

=== Creating a custom bean with constructor parameters

When creating a bean then parameters to the constructor can be provided.
Suppose we have a class `MyFoo` with a constructor:

[source,java]
----
public class MyFoo {
    private String name;
    private boolean important;
    private int id;

    public MyFoo(String name, boolean important, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.important = important;
        this.id = id;
    }
}
----

Then we can create a bean instance with name `foo` and provide parameters to the constructor as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
----

=== Creating custom beans with factory method

When creating a bean then parameters to a factorty method can be provided.
Suppose we have a class `MyFoo` with a static factory method:

[source,java]
----
public class MyFoo {
    private String name;
    private boolean important;
    private int id;

    private MyFoo() {
        // use factory method
    }

    public static MyFoo buildFoo(String name, boolean important, int id) {
        MyFoo foo = new MyFoo();
        foo.name = name;
        foo.important = important;
        foo.id = id;
        return foo;
    }
}
----

Then we can create a bean instance with name `foo` and provide parameters to the static factory method as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean#buildFoo("Hello World", true, 123)
----

IMPORTANT: The syntax must use `#factoryMethodName` to tell Camel that the bean
should be created from a factory method.

=== Optional parameters on beans

If a parameter on a bean is not mandatory then the parameter can be marked as optional using `?` syntax, as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
camel.beans.foo.?company = Acme
----

Then the company parameter is only set if `MyBean` has this option (silent ignore if no option present).
Otherwise, if a parameter is set, and the bean does not have such a parameter, then an exception is thrown by Camel.

=== Optional parameter values on beans

If a parameter value on a bean is configured using xref:manual:ROOT:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholder]
and the placeholder is optional, then the placeholder can be marked as optional using `?` syntax, as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
camel.beans.foo.company = {{?companyName}}
----

Then the company parameter is only set if there is a property placeholder with the key _companyName_ (silent ignore if no option present).

==== Default parameter values on beans

It is possible to supply a default value (using `:defaultValue`) if the placeholder does not exist as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
camel.beans.foo.company = {{?companyName:Acme}}
----

Here the default value is _Acme_ that will be used if there is no property placeholder with the key _companyName_.

=== Nested parameters on beans

You can configure nested parameters separating them via `.` (dot).

For example given this `Country` class:

[source,java]
----
public class Country {
    private String iso;
    private String name;

    public void setIso(String iso) {
        this.iso = iso;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
----

Which is an option on the `MyBean` class.
Then we can then configure its iso and name parameter as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
camel.beans.foo.country.iso = USA
camel.beans.foo.country.name = United States of America
----

Camel will automatically create an instance of `Country` if `MyBean` has a getter/setter for this option, and that the `Country` bean
has a default no-arg constructor.

=== Configuring singleton beans by their type

In the example above the SQL component was configured with the name of the `DataSource`. There can be situations where you know there is only
a single instance of a data source in the Camel registry. In such a situation you can instead refer to the class
or interface type via the `#type:` prefix as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #type:javax.sql.DataSource
----

If there is no bean in the registry with the type `javax.sql.DataSource` then the option isn't configured.

=== Autowiring beans

The example above can be taken one step further by letting `camel-main` try to autowire the beans.

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #autowired
----

In this situation then `#autowrired` will make Camel detect the type of the `dataSource` option on the `SQL` component.
Because type is a `javax.sql.DataSource` instance, then Camel will lookup in the registry if there is a single instance of the same type.
If there is no such bean then the option isn't configured.

== Defining a Map bean

You can specify `java.util.Map` beans in `camel-main` via properties (such as in the `application.properties` file).

Maps have a special syntax with brackets as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.mymap[table] = 12
camel.beans.mymap[food] = Big Burger
camel.beans.mymap[cheese] = yes
camel.beans.mymap[quantity] = 1
----

The Map is registered in the Camel Registry with the name `mymap`.

=== Using dots in Map keys

If the Map should contain keys with dots then the key must be quoted,
as shown below using single quoted keys:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.myldapserver['java.naming.provider.url'] = ldaps://ldap.local:636
camel.beans.myldapserver['java.naming.security.principal'] = scott
camel.beans.myldapserver['java.naming.security.credentials'] = tiger
----

== Defining a List bean

This is similar to Map bean where the key is the index, eg 0, 1, 2, etc:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.myprojects[0] = Camel
camel.beans.myprojects[1] = Kafka
camel.beans.myprojects[2] = Quarkus
----

The List is registered in the Camel Registry with the name `myprojects`.

== Examples

You can find a set of examples using `camel-main` in https://github.com/apache/camel-examples[Camel Examples]
which demonstrate running Camel in standalone with `camel-main`.
