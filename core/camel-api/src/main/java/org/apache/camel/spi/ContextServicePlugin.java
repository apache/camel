/**
 * A plugin interface that allows third-party components to perform initialization tasks when a CamelContext is being
 * configured and started.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are automatically discovered and loaded via the Java ServiceLoader mechanism. To
 * register a plugin, create a service provider configuration file at
 * {@code META-INF/services/org.apache.camel.spi.ContextServicePlugin} containing the fully qualified class name of your
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * Common use cases include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Registering beans in the Camel registry</li>
 * <li>Adding event notifiers for monitoring</li>
 * <li>Configuring global interceptors</li>
 * <li>Setting up custom type converters</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Example Usage:</h3>
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public class MyContextServicePlugin implements ContextServicePlugin {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void load(CamelContext camelContext) {
 *         // Register a bean in the registry
 *         camelContext.getRegistry().bind("myBean", new MyBean());
 *
 *         // Add an event notifier
 *         camelContext.getManagementStrategy().addEventNotifier(new MyEventNotifier());
 *     }
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
