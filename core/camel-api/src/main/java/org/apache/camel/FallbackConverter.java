/**
 * An annotation used to mark methods to indicate code capable of being a fallback converter which are then
 * auto-discovered using the <a href="http://camel.apache.org/type-converter.html">Type Conversion Support</a>.
 * <p/>
 * The difference between a regular <tt>@Converter</tt> and a <tt>@FallbackConverter</tt> is that the fallback is
 * resolved at last if no regular converter could be found. Also the method signature is scoped to be generic to allow
 * handling a broader range of types trying to be converted. The fallback converter can just return <tt>null</tt> if it
 * can not handle the types to convert from/to.
 *
 * @see        org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileConverter GenericFileConverter for an example.
 * @deprecated use @Converter(fallback = true) instead
