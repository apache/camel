/**
 * Marks a method as having a specific kind of {@link ExchangePattern} for use with
 * <a href="http://camel.apache.org/bean-integration.html">Bean Integration</a> or
 * <a href="http://camel.apache.org/spring-remoting.html">Spring Remoting</a> to overload the default value which is
 * {@link ExchangePattern#InOut} for request/reply if no annotations are used.
 *
 * There are abbreviation annotations like {@link InOnly} or {@link InOut} which are typically used for the common
 * message exchange patterns. You could also add this annotation onto your own custom annotation to default the message
 * exchange pattern when your own annotation is added to a method <a href="using-exchange-pattern-annotations.html">as
 * in this example</a>.
 *
 * This annotation can be added to individual methods or added to a class or interface to act as a default for all
 * methods within the class or interface.
 *
 * See the <a href="using-exchange-pattern-annotations.html">using exchange pattern annotations</a> for more details on
 * how the overloading rules work.
