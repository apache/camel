*Since Camel {since}*

The xml tokenizer language is a built-in language in camel-core, which
is a truly XML-aware tokenizer that can be used with the Splitter as the
conventional Tokenizer to efficiently and
effectively tokenize XML documents. XMLTokenizer is capable of not only
recognizing XML namespaces and hierarchical structures of the document
but also more efficiently tokenizing XML documents than the conventional
Tokenizer. 

For more details see Splitter.
