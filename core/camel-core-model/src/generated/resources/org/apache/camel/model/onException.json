This allows you to store the original input in the dead letter queue instead of the inprogress snapshot of the IN message. For instance if you route transform the IN body during routing and then failed. With the original exchange store in the dead letter queue it might be easier to manually re submit the org.apache.camel.Exchange again as the IN message is the same as when Camel received it. So you should be able to send the org.apache.camel.Exchange to the same input. The difference between useOriginalMessage and useOriginalBody is that the former includes both the original body and headers, where as the latter only includes the original body. You can use the latter to enrich the message with custom headers and include the original message body. The former wont let you do this, as its using the original message body and headers as they are. You cannot enable both useOriginalMessage and useOriginalBody.
