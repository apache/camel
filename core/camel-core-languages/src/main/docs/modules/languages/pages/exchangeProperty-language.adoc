The ExchangeProperty Expression Language allows you to extract values of
named exchange properties.

== Exchange Property Options

// language options: START
The ExchangeProperty language supports 1 options, which are listed below.

// language options: END

== Example

The `recipientList` EIP can utilize a exchangeProperty like:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:a" />
  <recipientList>
    <exchangeProperty>myProperty</exchangeProperty>
  </recipientList>
</route>
----

In this case, the list of recipients are contained in the property
'myProperty'.

And the same example in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a").recipientList(exchangeProperty("myProperty"));
----

== Dependencies

The ExchangeProperty language is part of *camel-core*.
