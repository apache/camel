*Since Camel {since}*

The Constant Expression Language is really just a way to use a constant value or object.

[NOTE]
====
This is a fixed constant value (or object) that is only set once during starting up the route,
do not use this if you want dynamic values during routing.
====

== Constant Options


// language options: START
The Constant language supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,1m,1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Default | Java Type | Description
| resultType |  | String | Sets the class name of the constant type
| trim | true | Boolean | Whether to trim the value to remove leading and trailing whitespaces and line breaks
|===
// language options: END


== Example

The `setHeader` EIP can utilize a constant
expression like:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <setHeader name="theHeader">
    <constant>the value</constant>
  </setHeader>
  <to uri="mock:b"/>
</route>
----

in this case, the message coming from the seda:a
endpoint will have the header with key `theHeader`
set its value as `the value` (string type).

And the same example using Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .setHeader("theHeader", constant("the value"))
  .to("mock:b");
----

=== Specifying type of value

The option `resultType` can be used to specify the type of the value, when the value is given
as a `String` value, which happens when using XML or YAML DSL:

For example to set a header with `int` type you can do:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <setHeader name="zipCode">
    <constant resultType="int">90210</constant>
  </setHeader>
  <to uri="mock:b"/>
</route>
----


== Loading constant from external resource

You can externalize the constant and have Camel load it from a resource
such as `"classpath:"`, `"file:"`, or `"http:"`. +
 This is done using the following syntax: `"resource:scheme:location"`,
eg to refer to a file on the classpath you can do:

[source,java]
----
.setHeader("myHeader").constant("resource:classpath:constant.txt")
----

== Dependencies

The Constant language is part of *camel-core*.
