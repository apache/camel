*Since Camel {since}*

The tokenizer language is a built-in language in camel-core, which is
most often used only with the Splitter EIP to split
a message using a token-based strategy. +
The tokenizer language is intended to tokenize text documents using a
specified delimiter pattern. It can also be used to tokenize XML
documents with some limited capability. For a truly XML-aware
tokenization, the use of the XMLTokenizer
language is recommended as it offers a faster, more efficient
tokenization specifically for XML documents.

For more details see xref:{eip-vc}:eips:split-eip.adoc[Split] EIP.
