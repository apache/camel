*Since Camel {since}*

The tokenizer language is a built-in language in `camel-core`, which is
most often used with the xref:eips:split-eip.adoc[Split] EIP
to split a message using a token-based strategy.

The tokenizer language is intended to tokenize text documents using a
specified delimiter pattern. It can also be used to tokenize XML
documents with some limited capability. For a truly XML-aware
tokenization, the use of the xref:xtokenize-language.adoc[XML Tokenize]
language is recommended as it offers a faster, more efficient
tokenization specifically for XML documents.

== Example

The following example shows how to take a request from the direct:a endpoint
then split it into pieces using an xref:manual::expression.adoc[Expression],
then forward each piece to direct:b:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:a"/>
  <split>
    <tokenize token="\n"/>
    <to uri="direct:b"/>
  </split>
</route>
----

And in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .split(body().tokenize("\n"))
        .to("direct:b");
----
