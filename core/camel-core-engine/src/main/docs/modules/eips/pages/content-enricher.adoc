Enricher] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns] using a xref:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator], an
arbitrary xref:latest@manual:ROOT:processor.adoc[Processor] in the routing logic, or using
the xref:content-enricher.adoc[enrich] DSL element to enrich the

== Content enrichment using a Message Translator or a Processor

*Using the* *xref:latest@manual:ROOT:fluent-builders.adoc[Fluent Builders]*

You can use xref:latest@manual:ROOT:templating.adoc[Templating] to consume a message from
one destination, transform it with something like
xref:components::velocity-component.adoc[Velocity] or xref:components::xquery-component.adoc[XQuery], and then send
it on to another destination. For example using InOnly (one way
messaging)

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:My.Queue")
    .to("velocity:com/acme/MyResponse.vm")
    .to("activemq:Another.Queue");
----

If you want to use InOut (request-reply) semantics to process requests
on the *My.Queue* queue on xref:components::activemq-component.adoc[ActiveMQ] with a template
generated response, then sending responses back to the JMSReplyTo
Destination you could use this:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:My.Queue")
    .to("velocity:com/acme/MyResponse.vm");
----

Here is a simple example using the xref:latest@manual:ROOT:dsl.adoc[DSL] directly to
transform the message

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/core/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/TransformViaDSLTest.java[tags=example]
----

In this example we add our own xref:latest@manual:ROOT:processor.adoc[Processor] using
explicit Java

[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/core/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/TransformTest.java[tags=example]
----

we can use xref:latest@manual:ROOT:bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration] to use any Java
method on any bean to act as the transformer

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:My.Queue")
    .beanRef("myBeanName", "myMethodName")
    .to("activemq:Another.Queue");
----

For further examples of this pattern in use you could look at one of the
JUnit tests

[[ContentEnricher-ContentenrichmentusingtheenrichDSLelement]]
== Content enrichment using the `enrich` DSL element

Camel comes with two flavors of content enricher in the DSL

* `enrich`
* `pollEnrich`

`enrich` uses a `Producer` to obtain the additional data. It is usually
used for xref:request-reply.adoc[Request Reply] messaging, for instance
to invoke an external web service. +
`pollEnrich` on the other hand uses a xref:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumer] to obtain the additional data. It is usually used for
xref:event-message.adoc[Event Message] messaging, for instance to read a
file or download a xref:components::ftp-component.adoc[FTP] file.

Camel 2.15 or older - Data from current Exchange not used

`pollEnrich` or `enrich` does *not* access any data from the current
xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] which means when polling it cannot use any
of the existing headers you may have set on the
xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]. For example you cannot set a filename in
the `Exchange.FILE_NAME` header and use `pollEnrich` to consume only
that file. For that you *must* set the filename in the endpoint URI.

Instead of using `enrich` you can use xref:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient
List] and have dynamic endpoints and define an `AggregationStrategy` on
the xref:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List] which then would work as a
`enrich` would do.

pollEnrich only accept one message as response. That means that if you
target to enrich your original message with the enricher collecting
messages from a seda, ... components using an aggregation strategy. Only
one response message will be aggregated with the original message.

From *Camel 2.16* onwards both enrich and pollEnrich supports dynamic
endpoints that uses an xref:latest@manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression] to compute the
uri, which allows to use data from the current
xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]. In other words all what is told above no
longer apply and it just works.

service as outgoing message. From *Camel 2.12* onwards you can also use
a POJO as the `AggregationStrategy`, see the
xref:aggregate-eip.adoc[Aggregate] page for more details.

|`strategyMethodName` |  |*Camel 2.12:* This option can be used to
explicit declare the method name to use, when using POJOs as the
`AggregationStrategy`. See the xref:aggregate-eip.adoc[Aggregate] page for

|`strategyMethodAllowNull` |`false` |*Camel 2.12:* If this option is
`false` then the aggregate method is not used if there was no data to
enrich. If this option is `true` then `null` values is used as the

`AggregationStrategy`. See the xref:aggregate-eip.adoc[Aggregate] page for
more details.

|`aggregateOnException` |`false` |*Camel 2.14:* If this option is
`false` then the aggregate method is *not* used if there was an

to suppress the exception or set a custom message body etc.

|`shareUnitOfWork` |`false` |*Camel 2.16:*  Shares the unit of work with

*Using the* *xref:latest@manual:ROOT:fluent-builders.adoc[Fluent Builders]*


[source,java]
----
AggregationStrategy aggregationStrategy = ... 

from("direct:start")
    .enrich("direct:resource", aggregationStrategy)
    .to("direct:result");

from("direct:resource") ...
----

The content enricher (`enrich`) retrieves additional data from a
_resource endpoint_ in order to enrich an incoming message (contained in
the _original exchange_). An aggregation strategy is used to combine the
original exchange and the _resource exchange_. The first parameter of
the `AggregationStrategy.aggregate(Exchange, Exchange)` method
corresponds to the the original exchange, the second parameter the
resource exchange. The results from the resource endpoint are stored in
the resource exchange's out-message. Here's an example template for
implementing an aggregation strategy:

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleAggregationStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {

    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange original, Exchange resource) {
        Object originalBody = original.getIn().getBody();
        Object resourceResponse = resource.getIn().getBody();
        Object mergeResult = ... // combine original body and resource response

        if (original.getPattern().isOutCapable()) {
            original.getOut().setBody(mergeResult);
        } else {
            original.getIn().setBody(mergeResult);
        }

        return original;
    }
}
----

Using this template the original exchange can be of any pattern. The
resource exchange created by the enricher is always an in-out exchange.

*Using Spring XML*

The same example in the Spring DSL

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>

[[ContentEnricher-Aggregationstrategyisoptional]]
=== Aggregation strategy is optional

The aggregation strategy is optional. If you do not provide it Camel
will by default just use the body obtained from the resource.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .enrich("direct:resource")
    .to("direct:result");
----

In the route above the message sent to the `direct:result` endpoint will
contain the output from the `direct:resource` as we do not use any
custom aggregation.

And for Spring DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <enrich>
        <constant>direct:resource</constant>
    </enrich>
    <to uri="direct:result"/>
</route>
----

[[ContentEnricher-Usingdynamicuris]]
=== Using dynamic uris

*Since Camel 2.16*

From Camel 2.16 onwards enrich and pollEnrich supports using dynamic
uris computed based on information from the
current xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]. For example to enrich from
a xref:components::http-component.adoc[HTTP] endpoint where the header with key orderId is
used as part of the content-path of the HTTP url:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .enrich().simple("http:myserver/$\{header.orderId}/order")
    .to("direct:result");
----

And in XML DSL

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <enrich>
        <simple>http:myserver/$\{header.orderId}/order</simple>
    </enrich>
    <to uri="direct:result"/>
</route>
----

[[ContentEnricher-ContentenrichmentusingpollEnrich]]
=== Content enrichment using `pollEnrich`

The `pollEnrich` works just as the `enrich` however as it uses a

|=======================================================================

Good practice to use timeout value

By default Camel will use the `receive`. Which may block until there is
a message available. It is therefore recommended to always provide a
timeout value, to make this clear that we may wait for a message, until
the timeout is hit.

If there is no data then the `newExchange` in the aggregation strategy
is `null`.

You can pass in a timeout value that determines which method to use

* if timeout is -1 or other negative number then `receive` is selected
(*Important:* the `receive` method may block if there is no message)
* if timeout is 0 then `receiveNoWait` is selected
* otherwise `receive(timeout)` is selected

The timeout values is in millis.

Camel 2.15 or older - Data from current Exchange not used

`pollEnrich` does *not* access any data from the current
xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] which means when polling it cannot use any
of the existing headers you may have set on the
xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]. For example you cannot set a filename in
the `Exchange.FILE_NAME` header and use `pollEnrich` to consume only
that file. For that you *must* set the filename in the endpoint URI.

From **Camel 2.16** onwards both enrich and pollEnrich supports dynamic
endpoints that uses an xref:latest@manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression] to compute the
uri, which allows to use data from the current
xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]. In other words all what is told above no
longer apply and it just works.

[[ContentEnricher-Example]]
==== Example

In this example we enrich the message by loading the content from the
file named inbox/data.txt.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .pollEnrich("file:inbox?fileName=data.txt")
    .to("direct:result");
----

And in XML DSL you do:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <pollEnrich>
        <constant>file:inbox?fileName=data.txt</constant>
    </pollEnrich>
    <to uri="direct:result"/>
</route>
----

If there is no file then the message is empty. We can use a timeout to
either wait (potentially forever) until a file exists, or use a timeout
to wait a certain period.

For example to wait up to 5 seconds you can do:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <pollEnrich timeout="5000">
        <constant>file:inbox?fileName=data.txt</constant>
    </pollEnrich>
    <to uri="direct:result"/>
</route>
----

[[ContentEnricher-Usingdynamicuris.1]]
==== Using dynamic uris

*Since Camel 2.16*

From Camel 2.16 onwards enrich and pollEnrich supports using dynamic
uris computed based on information from the
current xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]. For example to pollEnrich from an
endpoint that uses a header to indicate a xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] queue
name:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .pollEnrich()
    .simple("seda:$\{header.name}")
    .to("direct:result");
----

And in XML DSL

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <pollEnrich>
        <simple>seda:$\{header.name}</simple>
    </pollEnrich>
    <to uri="direct:result"/>
</route>
