= Return Address

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ReturnAddress.html[Return
Address] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns].

How does a replier know where to send the reply?

image::eip/ReturnAddressSolution.gif[image]

The request message should contain a Return Address that indicates where to send the reply message.

Camel supports Return Address by messaging xref:ROOT:index.adoc[Components]
that provides this functionality such as the xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS]
component via the `JMSReplyTo` header.

== Example

In the example below we send a message to the JMS cheese queue using `InOut` mode, this means
that Camel will automatically configure the `JMSReplyTo` header with a temporary queue as the Return Address.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:foo")
  .to(ExchangePattern.InOut, "jms:queue:cheese");
----

And in XML

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:foo"/>
    <to pattern="InOut" uri="jms:queue:cheese"/>
</route>
----

You can also specify a named reply queue with the `replyTo` option (instead of a temporary queue).
When doing so then `InOut` mode is implied:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:foo")
  .to("jms:queue:cheese?replyTo=myReplyQueue");
----

And in XML

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:foo"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:cheese?replyTo=myReplyQueue"/>
</route>
----
