= Correlation Identifier
:tabs-sync-option:

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CorrelationIdentifier.html[Correlation
Identifier] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns] by getting or setting a header on the xref:message.adoc[Message].

When working with the xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS]
components the correlation identifier header is called
*JMSCorrelationID*, and they handle the correlation automatically.

Other messaging systems, such as xref:ROOT:spring-rabbitmq-component.adoc[Spring RabbitMQ] also handles this automatic,
and you should generally not have a need for using custom correlation IDs with these systems.

You can use your own correlation identifier to any
message exchange to help correlate messages together to a single
conversation (or business process). For example if you need to correlation messages when using web services.

The use of a correlation identifier is key to working with xref:others:tracing.adoc[Distributed Tracing]
and be useful when using xref:manual::tracer.adoc[Tracer] messages to log,
or testing with simulation or canned data such as with the xref:ROOT:mock-component.adoc[Mock] testing framework.


== EIPs using correlation identifiers

Some xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP] patterns will spin off a sub message, and in
those cases, Camel will add a correlation id on the
xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] as a property with they key
`Exchange.CORRELATION_ID`, which links back to the source
xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] and its exchange id.

The following EIPs does this:

- xref:enrich-eip.adoc[Enrich]
- xref:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast]
- xref:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List]
- xref:split-eip.adoc[Split]
- xref:wireTap-eip.adoc[Wire Tap]

== Example

The following example uses a request/reply pattern in
the xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] component, where correlation identifiers are automatically handled:
