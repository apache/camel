The http://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/latest/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
is used for processing message xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchanges].

The processor is a core Camel concept that represents a node capable of using, creating,
or modifying an incoming exchange. During routing, exchanges flow from one processor
to another; as such, you can think of a route as a graph having specialized processors
as the nodes, and lines that connect the output of one processor to the input of another.
Processors could be implementations of EIPs, producers for specific components, or
your own custom creation. The figure below shows the flow between processors.

A route first starts with a consumer (think `from` in the DSL) that populates the initial
exchange. At each processor step, the out message from the previous step is the in
message of the next. In many cases, processors don’t set an out message, so in this case
the in message is reused. At the end of a route, the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Message Exchange Pattern] (MEP)
of the exchange determines whether a reply needs to be sent back to the caller of the route. If the MEP is `InOnly`,
no reply will be sent back. If it’s `InOut`, Camel will take the out message from the last
step and return it.

== Processor API

The `Processor` interface is a central API in Camel.
Its API is purposely designed to be both straightforward and flexible in the form of a single functional method:

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Processor {

    /**
     * Processes the message exchange
     *
     * @param  exchange  the message exchange
     * @throws Exception if an internal processing error has occurred.
     */
    void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception;
}
----

The `Processor` is used heavily internally in Camel, such as the base for all implementations of
the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

=== Using a processor in a route

Once you have written a class which implements `Processor` like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MyProcessor implements Processor {
  public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    // do something...
  }
}
----

Then in Camel you can call this processor:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:myQueue")
  .process(new MyProcessor());
----

You can also call a processor by its bean id, if the processor
has been enlisted in the xref:manual::registry.adoc[Registry], such as with the id `myProcessor`:

====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("activemq:myQueue")
  .process("myProcessor");
----

XML::
+
And in XML you can refer to the fully qualified class name via `#class:` syntax:
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="activemq:myQueue"/>
  <process ref="#class:com.foo.MyProcessor"/>
</route>
----

Spring XML::
+
Or if you use Spring XML you can create the processor via `<bean>`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<beans>

    <bean id="myProcessor" class="com.foo.MyProcessor"/>

    <camelContext>
        <routes>
            <route>
              <from uri="activemq:myQueue"/>
              <process ref="myProcessor"/>
            </route>
        </routes>
    </camelContext>

</beans>

=== Why use `process` when you can use `to` instead?

The process can be used in routes as an anonymous inner class such:

[source,java]
----
    from("activemq:myQueue").process(new Processor() {
        public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            String payload = exchange.getMessage().getBody(String.class);
            // do something with the payload and/or exchange here
           exchange.getMessage().setBody("Changed body");
       }
    }).to("activemq:myOtherQueue");
----

This is usable for quickly whirling up some code. If the code in the
inner class gets a bit more complicated, it is advised to
refactor it into a separate class.
