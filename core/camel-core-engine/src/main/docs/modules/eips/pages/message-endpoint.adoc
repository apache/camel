= Message Endpoint
:tabs-sync-option:

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageEndpoint.html[Message
Endpoint] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns] using the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface.

How does an application connect to a messaging channel to send and receive messages?

image::eip/MessageEndpointSolution.gif[image]

Connect an application to a messaging channel using a Message Endpoint, a client of the messaging system that the application can then use to send or receive messages.

When using the xref:manual::dsl.adoc[DSL] to create xref:manual::routes.adoc[Routes], you
typically refer to Message Endpoints by their xref:manual::uris.adoc[URIs]
rather than directly using the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface. It's then a responsibility of the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html[CamelContext]
to create and activate the necessary `Endpoint` instances using the
available xref:ROOT:index.adoc[Components].

== Example

The following example route demonstrates the use of a xref:ROOT:file-component.adoc[File] consumer endpoint and a xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] producer endpoint,
by their xref:manual::uris.adoc[URIs]:
