:description: Routes a message through a series of steps that are pre-determined (the slip)
:since: 
:supportlevel: Stable

Camel supports the
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RoutingTable.html[Routing Slip]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How do we route a message consecutively through a series of processing steps when the sequence of steps is not known at design-time and may vary for each message?

image::eip/RoutingTableSimple.gif[image]

Attach a Routing Slip to each message, specifying the sequence of processing steps. Wrap each component with a special message router that reads the Routing Slip and routes the message to the next component in the list.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

TIP: See the `cacheSize` option for more details on _how much cache_ to use depending on how many or few unique endpoints are used.

== Exchange properties

The following exchange properties are set on each `Exchange` that are sent by the routing slip:

[width="100%",cols="3,1m,6",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Property | Type | Description
| `CamelToEndpoint` | `String` | Uri of the `Endpoint` that the message was sent to.
| `CamelSlipEndpoint` | `String` | Uri of the `Endpoint` that the message was sent to.
|=======================================================================

== Using Routing Slip

The Routing Slip EIP allows to route a message through a series of xref:manual::endpoint.adoc[endpoints] (the slip).

There can be 1 or more endpoint xref:manual::uris.adoc[uris] in the slip.

TIP: A slip can be empty, meaning that the message will not be routed anywhere.

The following route will take any messages sent to the Apache ActiveMQ queue cheese
and use the header with key "whereTo" that is used to compute the slip (endpoint xref:manual::uris.adoc[uris]).

[source,java]
---------------------
from("activemq:cheese")
  .routingSlip(header("whereTo"));
---------------------

The value of the header ("whereTo") should be a comma-delimited string of endpoint URIs you wish the message to be routed to.
The message will be routed in a xref:pipeline-eip.adoc[pipeline] fashion, i.e., one after the other.

The Routing Slip sets a property, `Exchange.SLIP_ENDPOINT`, on the `Exchange` which contains the
current endpoint as it advanced though the slip. This allows you to _know_ how far we have processed in the slip.

The Routing Slip will compute the slip *beforehand* which means,
the slip is only computed once. If you need to compute the slip _on-the-fly_ then use the xref:dynamicRouter-eip.adoc[Dynamic Router] EIP instead.

The same example in XML is simply just:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="activemq:cheese"/>
  <routingSlip>
    <header>whereTo</header>
  </routingSlip>
</route>
----

=== How is the slip computed

The Routing Slip uses an xref:manual::expression.adoc[Expression] to compute the value for the slip.
The result of the expression can be one of:

- `String`
- `Collection`
- `Iterator` or `Iterable`
- Array

If the value is a `String` then the `uriDelimiter` is used to split the string into multiple uris.
The default delimiter is comma, but can be re-configured.

=== Ignore Invalid Endpoints

The Routing Slip supports `ignoreInvalidEndpoints` (like xref:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List] EIP).
You can use it to skip endpoints which are invalid.

[source,java]
---------------------
from("direct:start")
  .routingSlip("myHeader").ignoreInvalidEndpoints();
---------------------

And in XML DSL it is an attribute on `<routingSlip>`:

[source,xml]
---------------------
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <routingSlip ignoreInvalidEndpoints="true">
    <header>myHeader</header>
  </routingSlip>
</route>
---------------------

Then let us say the `myHeader` contains the following two endpoints `direct:foo,xxx:bar`.
The first endpoint is valid and works. However, the second one is invalid and will just be ignored.
Camel logs at DEBUG level about it, so you can see why the endpoint was invalid.
