Camel supports the

Enricher] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns].

In Camel the Content Enricher can be done in several ways:

* Using xref:enrich-eip.adoc[Enrich] EIP or xref:pollEnrich-eip.adoc[Poll Enrich] EIP
* Using a xref:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator]
* Using a xref:manual::processor.adoc[Processor] with the enrichment programmed in Java
* Using a xref:bean-eip.adoc[Bean] EIP with the enrichment programmed in Java

The most natural Camel approach is using xref:enrich-eip.adoc[Enrich] EIP,
which comes as two kinds:

* xref:enrich-eip.adoc[Enrich] EIP - This is the most common content enricher that uses a `Producer` to obtain the data.
It is usually used for xref:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request Reply] messaging, for instance to invoke an external web service.

* xref:pollEnrich-eip.adoc[Poll Enrich] EIP - Uses a xref:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumer] to obtain the additional data. It is usually used for
xref:event-message.adoc[Event Message] messaging, for instance to read a
file or download a xref:ROOT:ftp-component.adoc[FTP] file.

NOTE: This page documents the Enrich EIP.

== Content enrichment using Enrich EIP

Enrich EIP is the most common content enricher that uses a `Producer` to obtain the data.

The content enricher (`enrich`) retrieves additional data from a _resource endpoint_ in order to enrich an incoming message (contained in the _original exchange_).

An `AggregationStrategy` is used to combine the original exchange and the _resource exchange_. The first parameter of the `AggregationStrategy.aggregate(Exchange, Exchange)` method corresponds to the original exchange, the second parameter the resource exchange.

Here's an example for implementing an `AggregationStrategy`, which merges the two data together
as a `String` with colon separator:

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleAggregationStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {

    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange newExchange, Exchange oldExchange) {
        // this is just an example, for real-world use-cases the
        // aggregation strategy would be specific to the use-case

        if (newExchange == null) {
            return oldExchange;
        }
        Object oldBody = oldExchange.getIn().getBody();
        Object newBody = newExchange.getIn().getBody();
        oldExchange.getIn().setBody(oldBody + ":" + newBody);
        return oldExchange;
    }

}
----

In the example Camel will call the http endpoint to collect some data, that will then
be merged with the original message using the `AggregationStrategy`:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
AggregationStrategy aggregationStrategy = ...

from("direct:start")
  .enrich("http:remoteserver/foo", aggregationStrategy)
  .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myStrategy" class="com.foo.ExampleAggregationStrategy"/>

<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <enrich aggregationStrategy="myStrategy">
      <constant>http:remoteserver/foo</constant>
    </enrich>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: direct:start
    steps:
      - enrich:
          expression:
            constant: "http:remoteserver/foo"
          aggregationStrategy: "#myStrategy"
      - to: 
          uri: mock:result
- beans:
    - name: myStrategy
      type: com.foo.ExampleAggregationStrategy
----

=== Aggregation Strategy is optional

The aggregation strategy is optional.
If not provided then Camel will just use the result exchange as the result.

The following example:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .enrich("http:remoteserver/foo")
  .to("direct:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <enrich>
        <constant>http:remoteserver/foo</constant>
    </enrich>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: direct:start
    steps:
      - enrich:
          expression:
            constant: "http:remoteserver/foo"
      - to: 
          uri: mock:result
----
====

Would be the same as using `to`:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .to("http:remoteserver/foo")
  .to("direct:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="http:remoteserver/foo"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: direct:start
    steps:
      - to:
          uri: http:remoteserver/foo
      - to:
          uri: mock:result
----
====

=== Using dynamic uris

Both `enrich` and `pollEnrich` supports using dynamic uris computed based on information from the current Exchange. For example to enrich from a HTTP endpoint where the header with key orderId is used as part of the content-path of the HTTP url:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .enrich().simple("http:myserver/${header.orderId}/order")
  .to("direct:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <enrich>
    <simple>http:myserver/${header.orderId}/order</simple>
  </enrich>
  <to uri="direct:result"/>
</route>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: direct:start
    steps:
      - enrich:
          expression:
            simple: "http:myserver/${header.orderId}/order"
      - to: 
          uri: mock:result
----
====

TIP: See the `cacheSize` option for more details on _how much cache_ to use depending on how many or few unique endpoints are used.

=== Using out of the box Aggregation Strategies

The `org.apache.camel.builder.AggregationStrategies` is a builder that can
be used for creating commonly used aggregation strategies without having to create a class.

For example the `ExampleAggregationStrategy` from previously can be built as follows:

[source,java]
----
AggregationStrategy agg = AggregationStrategies.string(":");
----

There are many other possibilities with the `AggregationStrategies` builder, and for
more details see the https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.apache.camel/camel-core-model/3.12.0/org/apache/camel/builder/AggregationStrategies.html[AggregationStrategies javadoc].
