= Change Data Capture

Camel supports the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture[Change Data Capture] pattern.

This pattern allows tracking changes in databases, and then let applications listen to change events,
and react accordingly.
For example, this can be used as a xref:messaging-bridge.adoc[Messaging Bridge] to
bridge two systems.

Camel integrates with https://debezium.io/[Debezium], which is a CDC system.
There are a number of Camel Debezium
components that work with different databases such as MySQL, Postgres, and MongoDB.
