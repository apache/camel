= Marshal EIP
:tabs-sync-option:

The xref:marshal-eip.adoc[Marshal] and xref:unmarshal-eip.adoc[Unmarshal] EIPs are used
for xref:message-translator.adoc[Message Transformation].

image::eip/MessageTranslator.gif[image]

Camel has support for message transformation using several techniques.
One such technique is xref:components:dataformats:index.adoc[Data Formats],
where marshal and unmarshal comes from.

So in other words the xref:marshal-eip.adoc[Marshal] and xref:unmarshal-eip.adoc[Unmarshal] EIPs
are used with xref:dataformats:index.adoc[Data Formats].

- _Marshal_ - Transforms the message body (such as Java object) into a binary or textual format, ready to be wired over the network.
- _Unmarshal_ - Transforms data in some binary or textual format (such as received over the network)
into a Java object; or some other representation according to the data format being used.

== Example

The following example reads XML files from the inbox/xml directory.
Each file is then transformed into Java Objects using xref:dataformats:jaxb-dataformat.adoc[JAXB].
Then a xref:ROOT:bean-component.adoc[Bean] is invoked that takes in the Java object.

Then the reverse operation happens to transform the Java objects back into XML also via JAXB,
but using the `marshal` operation. And finally the message is routed to a xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] queue.
