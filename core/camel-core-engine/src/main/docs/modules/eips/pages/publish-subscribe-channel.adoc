= Publish Subscribe Channel
:tabs-sync-option:

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PublishSubscribeChannel.html[Publish-Subscribe Channel]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How can the sender broadcast an event to all interested receivers?

image::eip/PublishSubscribeSolution.gif[image]

Send the event on a Publish-Subscribe Channel, which delivers a copy of a particular event to each receiver.

The Publish-Subscribe Channel is supported in Camel by messaging based xref:ROOT:index.adoc[Components], such as:

* xref:ROOT:amqp-component.adoc[AMQP] for working with AMQP Queues
* xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[ActiveMQ], or xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] for working with JMS Queues
* xref:ROOT:seda-component.adoc[SEDA] for internal Camel seda queue based messaging
* xref:ROOT:spring-rabbitmq-component.adoc[Spring RabbitMQ] for working with AMQP Queues (RabbitMQ)

There is also messaging based in the cloud from cloud providers such as Amazon, Google and Azure.
