= Event Driven Consumer

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/EventDrivenConsumer.html[Event Driven Consumer]
from the
xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

The default consumer model is event based (i.e. asynchronous)
as this means that the Camel container can then manage pooling,
threading and concurrency for you in a declarative manner.

TIP: The alternative consumer mode is xref:pollEnrich-eip.adoc[Polling Consumer].

The Event Driven Consumer is implemented by consumers implementing the
http://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/latest/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
interface which is invoked by the xref:message-endpoint.adoc[Message Endpoint]
when a xref:message.adoc[Message] is available for processing.

== Example

The following demonstrates a xref:bean-eip.adoc[Bean] being invoked when
an event occurs from a xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] queue.

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:foo")
    .bean(MyBean.class);
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
    <bean beanType="com.foo.MyBean"/>
</route>
----
