IMPORTANT: The Service Call EIP is deprecated in Camel 3.x and will be removed in a future Camel release. There is no direct replacement.
If you use Kubernetes then services can be called directly by name.

How can I call a remote service in a distributed system where the service is looked up from a service registry of some sorts?

image::eip/MessagingGatewayIcon.gif[image]

Use a Service Call acting as a xref:messaging-gateway.adoc[Messaging Gateway] for distributed systems, that
handles the complexity of calling the service in a reliable manner.

The pattern has the following noteworthy features:

* _Location transparency_ — Decouples Camel and the physical location of the services
using logical names representing the services.
* _URI templating_ — Allows you to template the Camel endpoint URI as the physical
endpoint to use when calling the service.
* _Service discovery_ - Looks up the service from a service registry of some sort to know
the physical locations of the services.
* _Service filter_ — Allows you to filter unwanted services (for example, blacklisted or
unhealthy services).
* _Service chooser_ — Allows you to choose the most appropriate service based on
factors such as geographical zone, affinity, plans, canary deployments, and SLAs.
* _Load balancer_ — A preconfigured Service Discovery, Filter, and Chooser intended
for a specific runtime (these three features combined as one).

In a nutshell, the EIP pattern sits between your Camel application and the services running
in a distributed system (cluster). The pattern hides all the complexity of keeping
track of all the physical locations where the services are running and allows you to call
the service by a name.

== Using Service Call

The service to call is looked up in a service registry of some sorts such as Kubernetes, Consul, Zookeeper, DNS.
The EIP separates the configuration of the service registry from the calling of the service.

When calling a service you may just refer to the name of the service in the EIP as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall("foo")
    .to("mock:result");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <serviceCall name="foo"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

Camel will then:

* search for a service call configuration from the Camel context and registry
* lookup a service with the name ```foo``` from an external service registry
* filter the servers
* select the server to use
* build a Camel URI using the chosen server info

By default, the Service Call EIP uses `camel-http` so assuming that the selected service
instance runs on host ```myhost.com``` on port ```80```, the computed Camel URI will be:

[source,text]
----
http:myhost.com:80
----

=== Mapping Service Name to Endpoint URI

It is often needed to build more complex Camel URI which may include options or paths which is possible through different options:name: value

The *service name* supports a limited uri like syntax, here some examples

[width="100%",cols="25%a,75%a",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Resolution

|foo | http://host:port
|foo/path | http://host:port/path
|foo/path?foo=bar | http://host:port/path?foo=bar
|===

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall("foo/hello")
    .to("mock:result");
----

If you want to have more control over the uri construction, you can use the *uri* directive:

[width="100%",cols="25%a,40%a,35%a",options="header"]
|===
|Name | URI | Resolution
|foo | undertow:http://foo/hello | undertow:http://host:port/hello
|foo | undertow:http://foo.host:foo.port/hello | undertow:http://host:port/hello
|===

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall("foo", "undertow:http://foo/hello")
    .to("mock:result");
----

Advanced users can have full control over the uri construction through expressions:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall()
        .name("foo")
        .expression()
            .simple("undertow:http://${header.CamelServiceCallServiceHost}:${header.CamelServiceCallServicePort}/hello");
----

=== Static Service Discovery

This service discovery implementation does not query any external services to find out the list of services associated to a named service but keep them in memory. Each service should be provided in the following form:

[source,text]
----
[service@]host:port
----

[TIP]
====
The ``service`` part is used to discriminate against the services but if not provided it acts like a wildcard so each non named service will be returned whatever the service name is. This is useful if you have a single service so the service name is redundant.
====

[NOTE]
====
This implementation is provided by ``camel-core`` artifact.

Available options:

[width="100%",cols="3,1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Java Type | Description
| servers | String | A comma separated list of servers in the form: [service@]host:port,[service@]host2:port,[service@]host3:port

        .staticServiceDiscovery()
            .servers("service1@host1:80,service1@host2:80")
            .servers("service2@host1:8080,service2@host2:8080,service2@host3:8080")
            .end()
    .to("mock:result");
----

And in XML:

      </staticServiceDiscovery>
    </serviceCall>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>

=== Using service filtering

The Service Call EIP supports filtering the services using built-in filters, or a custom filter.

==== Blacklist Service Filter

This service filter implementation removes the listed services from those found by the service discovery.
Each service should be provided in the following form:

[source,text]
----
[service@]host:port
----

[NOTE]
====
The services are removed if they fully match
====

Available options:

[width="100%",cols="3,1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Java Type | Description
| servers | String | A comma separated list of servers to blacklist: [service@]host:port,[service@]host2:port,[service@]host3:port
|===

Example in Java:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall("foo")
        .staticServiceDiscovery()
            .servers("service1@host1:80,service1@host2:80")
            .servers("service2@host1:8080,service2@host2:8080,service2@host3:8080")
            .end()
        .blacklistFilter()
            .servers("service2@host2:8080")
            .end()
    .to("mock:result");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <serviceCall name="foo">
      <staticServiceDiscovery>
        <servers>service1@host1:80,service1@host2:80</servers>
        <servers>service2@host1:8080,service2@host2:8080,service2@host3:8080</servers>
      </staticServiceDiscovery>
      <blacklistServiceFilter>
        <servers>service2@host2:8080</servers>
      </blacklistServiceFilter>
    </serviceCall>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

==== Custom Service Filter

Service Filters choose suitable candidates from the service definitions found in the service discovery. 

The service filter have access to the current exchange, which allows you to create service filters
comparing service metadata with message content.

Assuming you have labeled one of the services in your service discovery to support a certain type of requests:

[source,java]
----
serviceDiscovery.addServer(new DefaultServiceDefinition("service", "127.0.0.1", 1003, 
    Collections.singletonMap("supports", "foo")));
----

The current exchange has a property which says that it needs a foo service:

[source,java]
----
exchange.setProperty("needs", "foo");
----

You can then use a `ServiceFilter` to select the service instances which match the exchange:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall()
        .name("service")
        .serviceFilter((exchange, services) -> services.stream()
			.filter(serviceDefinition -> Optional.ofNullable(serviceDefinition.getMetadata()
				.get("supports"))
				.orElse("")
				.equals(exchange.getProperty("needs", String.class)))
			.collect(Collectors.toList()));
        .end()
    .to("mock:result");
----

=== Shared configurations

The Service Call EIP can be configured straight on the route definition or through shared configurations,
here an example with two configurations registered in the `CamelContext`:

[source,java]
----
ServiceCallConfigurationDefinition globalConf = new ServiceCallConfigurationDefinition();
globalConf.setServiceDiscovery(
    name -> Arrays.asList(
        new DefaultServiceDefinition(name, "my.host1.com", 8080),
        new DefaultServiceDefinition(name, "my.host2.com", 443))
);
globalConf.setServiceChooser(
    list -> list.get(ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(list.size()))
);

ServiceCallConfigurationDefinition httpsConf = new ServiceCallConfigurationDefinition();
httpsConf.setServiceFilter(
    list -> list.stream().filter((exchange, s) -> s.getPort() == 443).collect(toList())
);

getContext().setServiceCallConfiguration(globalConf);
getContext().addServiceCallConfiguration("https", httpsConf);
----

Each Service Call definition and configuration will inherit from the `globalConf` which can be seen as default configuration,
then you can reference the `httpsConf` in your route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall()
        .name("foo")
        .serviceCallConfiguration("https")
    .end()
    .to("mock:result");
----

This route will leverage the service discovery and service chooser from `globalConf` and the service filter from `httpsConf,
but you can override any of them if needed straight on the route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .serviceCall()
        .name("foo")
        .serviceCallConfiguration("https")
        .serviceChooser(list -> list.get(0))
    .end()
    .to("mock:result");
----
