:description: Aggregates many messages into a single message
:since: 
:supportlevel: Stable
:tabs-sync-option:

The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Aggregator.html[Aggregator]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] allows
you to combine a number of messages into a single message.

How do we combine the results of individual, but related, messages so that they can be processed as a whole?

image::eip/Aggregator.gif[image]

Use a stateful filter, an Aggregator, to collect and store individual messages until a complete set of related messages has been received. Then, the Aggregator publishes a single message distilled from the individual messages.

The aggregator is one of the most complex EIP and has many features and configurations.

The logic for combing messages together is _correlated_ in buckets based on a _correlation key_.
Messages with the same correlation key are aggregated together, using an `AggregationStrategy`.

== Aggregate options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Worker pools

The aggregate EIP will always use a worker pool used to process all the outgoing messages from the aggregator.
The worker pool is determined accordingly:

- If a custom `ExecutorService` has been configured, then this is used as worker pool.
- If `parallelProcessing=true` then a _default_ worker pool (is 10 worker threads by default) is created.
However, the thread pool size and other configurations can be configured using _thread pool profiles_.
- Otherwise, a single threaded worker pool is created.
- To achieve synchronous aggregation, use an instance of `SynchronousExecutorService` for the
`executorService` option. The aggregated output will execute in the same thread that called the aggregator.

== Aggregating

The `AggregationStrategy` is used for aggregating the old, and the new exchanges together into a single exchange;
that becomes the next old, when the next message is aggregated, and so forth.

Possible implementations include performing some kind of combining or
delta processing.
For instance, adding line items together into an invoice or
just using the newest exchange and removing old exchanges such as for
state tracking or market data prices, where old values are of little
use.

Notice the aggregation strategy is a mandatory option and must be
provided to the aggregator.

IMPORTANT: In the aggregate method, do not create a new exchange instance to return,
instead return either the old or new exchange from the input parameters;
favor returning the old exchange whenever possible.

Here are a few example `AggregationStrategy` implementations that should
help you create your own custom strategy.

[source,java]
----
//simply combines Exchange String body values using '+' as a delimiter
class StringAggregationStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {

    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {
        if (oldExchange == null) {
            return newExchange;
        }

        String oldBody = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        String newBody = newExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        oldExchange.getIn().setBody(oldBody + "+" + newBody);
        return oldExchange;
    }
}

//simply combines Exchange body values into an ArrayList<Object>
class ArrayListAggregationStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {

    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {
        Object newBody = newExchange.getIn().getBody();
        ArrayList<Object> list = null;
        if (oldExchange == null) {
            list = new ArrayList<Object>();
            list.add(newBody);
            newExchange.getIn().setBody(list);
            return newExchange;
        } else {
            list = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(ArrayList.class);
            list.add(newBody);
            return oldExchange;
        }
    }
}
----

TIP: The `org.apache.camel.builder.AggregationStrategies` is a builder that can
be used for creating commonly used aggregation strategies without having to create a class.

=== Exchange Properties

The completed (outgoing) exchange from the Aggregate EIP contains the following information
as exchange properties, allowing you to know how the exchange was completed, and how
many messages were combined.

[width="100%",cols="3,1m,6",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Property | Type | Description
| `CamelAggregatedSize` | `int` | The total number of messages aggregated.
| `CamelAggregatedCompletedBy` | `String` | The condition that triggered the completion. Possible values are size, timeout, interval, predicate, force, strategy, and consumer. The consumer value represents the completion from batch consumer.
| `CamelAggregatedCorrelationKey` | `String` | The correlation identifier as a `String`.
| `CamelAggregatedTimeout` | `long` | The time-out in milliseconds as set by the completion time-out.
|=======================================================================


=== Aggregate by grouping exchanges

In the route below we group all the exchanges together using
`GroupedExchangeAggregationStrategy`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    // aggregates all using the same expression and group the
    // exchanges, so we get one single exchange containing all
    // the others
    .aggregate(new GroupedExchangeAggregationStrategy()).constant(true)
    // wait for 0.5 seconds to aggregate
    .completionTimeout(500L).to("mock:result");
----

As a result we have one outgoing `Exchange` being
routed to the `"mock:result"` endpoint. The exchange is a holder
containing all the incoming Exchanges.

The output of the aggregator will then contain the exchanges grouped
together in a list as shown below:

[source,java]
----
List<Exchange> grouped = exchange.getMessage().getBody(List.class);
----

=== Aggregating into a List

If you want to aggregate some value from the messages `<V>` into a `List<V>`
then you can use the
`org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.AbstractListAggregationStrategy`
abstract class.

The completed Exchange sent out of the aggregator will contain the `List<V>` in
the message body.

For example, to aggregate a `List<Integer>` you can extend this class as
shown below, and implement the `getValue` method:

[source,java]
----
public class MyListOfNumbersStrategy extends AbstractListAggregationStrategy<Integer> {

    @Override
    public Integer getValue(Exchange exchange) {
        // the message body contains a number, so return that as-is
        return exchange.getIn().getBody(Integer.class);
    }
}
----

The `org.apache.camel.builder.AggregationStrategies` is a builder that can
be used for creating commonly used aggregation strategies without having to create a class.

The previous example can also be built using the builder as shown:

[source,java]
----
AggregationStrategy agg = AggregationStrategies.flexible(Integer.class)
    .accumulateInCollection(ArrayList.class)
    .pick(body());
----

=== Aggregating on timeout

If your aggregation strategy implements
`TimeoutAwareAggregationStrategy`, then Camel will invoke the `timeout`
method when the timeout occurs. Notice that the values for index and
total parameters will be -1, and the timeout parameter will be provided
only if configured as a fixed value. You must *not* throw any exceptions
from the `timeout` method.

=== Aggregate with persistent repository

The aggregator provides a pluggable repository which you can implement
your own `org.apache.camel.spi.AggregationRepository`.

If you need a persistent repository, then Camel provides numerous implementations, such as from the
xref:ROOT:caffeine-cache-component.adoc[Caffeine],
xref:ROOT:cql-component.adoc[CassandraQL],
xref:ROOT:ehcache-component.adoc[EHCache],
xref:ROOT:infinispan-component.adoc[Infinispan],
xref:ROOT:jcache-component.adoc[JCache],
xref:others:leveldb.adoc[LevelDB],
xref:others:redis.adoc[Redis],
or xref:ROOT:sql-component.adoc[SQL] components.

== Completion

When aggregation xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange]s at some point, you need to
indicate that the aggregated exchanges are complete, so they can be sent
out of the aggregator. Camel allows you to indicate completion in
various ways as follows:

* _completionTimeout_: Is an inactivity timeout in that is triggered if
no new exchanges have been aggregated for that particular correlation
key within the period.
* _completionInterval_: Once every X period all the current aggregated
exchanges are completed.
* _completionSize_: Is a number indicating that after X aggregated
exchanges its complete.
* _completionPredicate_: Runs a xref:manual::predicate.adoc[Predicate] when a new
exchange is aggregated to determine if we are complete or not.
The configured aggregationStrategy can implement the
Predicate interface and will be used as the completionPredicate if no
completionPredicate is configured. The configured aggregationStrategy can
override the `preComplete` method and will be used as
the completionPredicate in pre-complete check mode. See further below
for more details.
* _completionFromBatchConsumer_: Special option for
xref:manual::batch-consumer.adoc[Batch Consumer], which allows you to complete
when all the messages from the batch have been aggregated.
* _forceCompletionOnStop_: Indicates to complete all current
aggregated exchanges when the context is stopped
* _AggregateController_: which allows to use an external source (`AggregateController` implementation) to complete groups or all groups.
This can be done using Java or JMX API.

All the different completions are per correlation key. You can
combine them in any way you like. It's basically the first that
triggers that wins. So you can use a completion size together with a
completion timeout. Only completionTimeout and completionInterval cannot
be used at the same time.

Completion is mandatory and must be configured on the aggregation.

=== Pre-completion mode

There can be use-cases where you want the incoming
xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] to determine if the correlation group
should pre-complete, and then the incoming
xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] is starting a new group from scratch.
The pre-completion mode must be enabled by the `AggregationStrategy` by overriding the `canPreComplete` method
to return a `true` value.

When pre-completion is enabled then the `preComplete` method is invoked:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Determines if the aggregation should complete the current group, and start a new group, or the aggregation
 * should continue using the current group.
 *
 * @param oldExchange the oldest exchange (is <tt>null</tt> on first aggregation as we only have the new exchange)
 * @param newExchange the newest exchange (can be <tt>null</tt> if there was no data possible to acquire)
 * @return <tt>true</tt> to complete current group and start a new group, or <tt>false</tt> to keep using current
 */
boolean preComplete(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange);
----

If the `preComplete` method returns `true`, then the existing correlation group is
completed (without aggregating the incoming exchange (`newExchange`).
Then the `newExchange` is used to start the correlation group from scratch,
so the group would contain only that new incoming exchange. This is
known as pre-completion mode.

The `newExchange` contains the following exchange properties, which can be used
to determine whether to pre complete.

[width="100%",cols="3,1m,6",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Property | Type | Description
| `CamelAggregatedSize` | `int` | The total number of messages aggregated.
| `CamelAggregatedCorrelationKey` | `String` | The correlation identifier as a `String`.
|=======================================================================

When the aggregation is in _pre-completion_ mode, then only the following completions are in use:

* _completionTimeout_ or _completionInterval_ can also be used as fallback
completions
* any other completions are not used (such as by size, from batch consumer, etc.)
* _eagerCheckCompletion_ is implied as `true`, but the option has no effect

=== CompletionAwareAggregationStrategy

If your aggregation strategy implements
`CompletionAwareAggregationStrategy`, then Camel will invoke the
`onComplete` method when the aggregated `Exchange` is completed. This
allows you to do any last minute custom logic such as to clean up some
resources, or additional work on the exchange as it's now completed.
You must *not* throw any exceptions from the `onCompletion` method.

=== Completing the current group decided from the AggregationStrategy

The `AggregationStrategy` supports checking for the exchange property (`Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_CURRENT_GROUP`)
on the returned `Exchange` that contains a boolean to indicate if the current
group should be completed. This allows to overrule any existing
completion predicates / sizes / timeouts etc., and complete the group.

For example, the following logic will complete the
group if the message body size is larger than 5. This is done by setting
the exchange property `Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_CURRENT_GROUP` to `true`.

[source,java]
----
public final class MyCompletionStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {
    @Override
    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {
        if (oldExchange == null) {
            return newExchange;
        }
        String body = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class) + "+"
            + newExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        oldExchange.getIn().setBody(body);
        if (body.length() >= 5) {
            oldExchange.setProperty(Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_CURRENT_GROUP, true);
        }
        return oldExchange;
    }
}
----

=== Completing all previous group decided from the AggregationStrategy

The `AggregationStrategy` checks an exchange property, from the returned exchange,
indicating if all previous groups should be completed.

This allows to overrule any existing
completion predicates / sizes / timeouts etc., and complete all the existing
previous group.

The following logic will complete all the
previous groups, and start a new aggregation group.

This is done by setting the property `Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_ALL_GROUPS` to `true`
on the returned exchange.

[source,java]
----
public final class MyCompletionStrategy implements AggregationStrategy {
    @Override
    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {
        if (oldExchange == null) {
            // we start a new correlation group, so complete all previous groups
            newExchange.setProperty(Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_ALL_GROUPS, true);
            return newExchange;
        }

        String body1 = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        String body2 = newExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);

        oldExchange.getIn().setBody(body1 + body2);
        return oldExchange;
    }
}
----

=== Manually force the completion of all aggregated Exchanges immediately

You can manually trigger completion of all current aggregated exchanges
by sending an exchange containing the exchange property
`Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_ALL_GROUPS` set to `true`. The message is
considered a signal message only, the message headers/contents will not
be processed otherwise.

You can alternatively set the exchange property
`Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_ALL_GROUPS_INCLUSIVE` to `true` to trigger
completion of all groups after processing the current message.

=== Using a controller to force the aggregator to complete

The `org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.AggregateController` allows
you to control the aggregate at runtime using Java or JMX API. This can
be used to force completing groups of exchanges, or query its current
runtime statistics.

The aggregator provides a default implementation if no custom one has been
configured, which can be accessed using `getAggregateController()` method.
Though it may be easier to configure a controller in the route using
`aggregateController` as shown below:

[source,java]
----
private AggregateController controller = new DefaultAggregateController();

from("direct:start")
   .aggregate(header("id"), new MyAggregationStrategy())
      .completionSize(10).id("myAggregator")
      .aggregateController(controller)
      .to("mock:aggregated");
----

Then there is API on `AggregateController` to force completion. For
example, to complete a group with key foo:

[source,java]
----
int groups = controller.forceCompletionOfGroup("foo");
----

The returned value is the number of groups completed.
A value of 1 is returned if the foo group existed, otherwise 0 is returned.

There is also a method to complete all groups:

[source,java]
----
int groups = controller.forceCompletionOfAllGroups();
----

The controller can also be used in XML DSL using the `aggregateController` to
refer to a bean with the controller implementation, which is looked up in the registry.

When using Spring XML, you can create the bean with `<bean>` as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myController" class="org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.DefaultAggregateController"/>
 
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <aggregate aggregationStrategy="myAppender" completionSize="10"
                   aggregateController="myController">
            <correlationExpression>
                <header>id</header>
            </correlationExpression>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </aggregate>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

There is also JMX API on the aggregator which is available under the processors node in the Camel JMX tree.

== Aggregating with Beans

To use the `AggregationStrategy` you had to implement the
`org.apache.camel.AggregationStrategy` interface,
which means your logic would be tied to the Camel API.
You can use a bean for the logic and let Camel adapt to your
bean. To use a bean, then a convention must be followed:

* there must be a public method to use
* the method must not be void
* the method can be static or non-static
* the method must have two or more parameters
* the parameters are paired, so the first half is applied to the
`oldExchange`, and the reminder half is for the `newExchange`.
 Therefore, there must be an equal number of parameters, e.g., 2, 4, 6, etc.

The paired methods are expected to be ordered as follows:

* the first parameter is the message body
* optional, the second parameter is a `Map` of the headers
* optional, the third parameter is a `Map` of the exchange properties

This convention is best explained with some examples.

In the method below, we have only two parameters, so the first parameter is
the body of the `oldExchange`, and the second is paired to the body of the
`newExchange`:

[source,java]
----
public String append(String existing, String next) {
    return existing + next;
}
----

In the method below, we have only four parameters, so the first parameter is
the body of the `oldExchange`, and the second is the `Map` of the
`oldExchange` headers, and the third is paired to the body of the `newExchange`,
and the fourth parameter is the `Map` of the `newExchange` headers:

[source,java]
----
public String append(String existing, Map existingHeaders, String next, Map nextHeaders) {
    return existing + next;
}
----

And finally, if we have six parameters, that includes the exchange properties:

[source,java]
----
public String append(String existing, Map existingHeaders, Map existingProperties,
                     String next, Map nextHeaders, Map nextProperties) {
    return existing + next;
}
----

To use this with the aggregate EIP, we can use a bean with the aggregate logic as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class MyBodyAppender {

    public String append(String existing, String next) {
        return next + existing;
    }

}
----

And then in the Camel route we create an instance of our bean, and then
refer to the bean in the route using `bean` method from
`org.apache.camel.builder.AggregationStrategies` as shown:

[source,java]
----
private MyBodyAppender appender = new MyBodyAppender();

public void configure() throws Exception {
    from("direct:start")
        .aggregate(constant(true), AggregationStrategies.bean(appender, "append"))
            .completionSize(3)
            .to("mock:result");
}
----

We can also provide the bean class type directly:

[source,java]
----
public void configure() throws Exception {
    from("direct:start")
        .aggregate(constant(true), AggregationStrategies.bean(MyBodyAppender.class, "append"))
            .completionSize(3)
            .to("mock:result");
}
----

And if the bean has only one method, we do not need to specify the name
of the method:

[source,java]
----
public void configure() throws Exception {
    from("direct:start")
        .aggregate(constant(true), AggregationStrategies.bean(MyBodyAppender.class))
            .completionSize(3)
            .to("mock:result");
}
----

And the `append` method could be static:

[source,java]
----
public class MyBodyAppender {

    public static String append(String existing, String next) {
        return next + existing;
    }

}
----

If you are using XML DSL, then we need to declare a `<bean>` with the bean:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myAppender" class="com.foo.MyBodyAppender"/>
----

And in the Camel route we use `aggregationStrategy` to refer to the bean by its
id, and the `strategyMethodName` can be used to define the method name
to call:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <aggregate aggregationStrategy="myAppender" aggregationStrategyMethodName="append" completionSize="3">
            <correlationExpression>
                <constant>true</constant>
            </correlationExpression>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </aggregate>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

When using XML DSL, you can also specify the bean class directly in `aggregationStrategy`
using the `#class:` syntax as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <aggregate aggregationStrategy="#class:com.foo.MyBodyAppender" aggregationStrategyMethodName="append" completionSize="3">
        <correlationExpression>
            <constant>true</constant>
        </correlationExpression>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </aggregate>
</route>
----

You can use this in XML DSL when you are not using the classic Spring XML files (
where you use XML only for Camel routes).

=== Aggregating when no data

When using bean as `AggregationStrategy`, then the method is
*only* invoked when there is data to be aggregated, meaning that the message body
is not `null`. In cases where you want to have the method invoked, even when there are no data (message body is `null`),
then set the `strategyMethodAllowNull` to `true`.

When using beans, this can be configured a bit easier using the `beanAllowNull` method
from `AggregationStrategies` as shown:

[source,java]
----
public void configure() throws Exception {
    from("direct:start")
        .pollEnrich("seda:foo", 1000, AggregationStrategies.beanAllowNull(appender, "append"))
            .to("mock:result");
}
----

Then the `append` method in the bean would need to deal with the
situation that `newExchange` can be `null`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyBodyAppender {

    public String append(String existing, String next) {
        if (next == null) {
            return "NewWasNull" + existing;
        } else {
            return existing + next;
        }
    }

}
----

In the example above we use the xref:content-enricher.adoc[Content Enricher]
EIP using `pollEnrich`. The `newExchange` will be `null` in the
situation we could not get any data from the "seda:foo" endpoint, and
a timeout was hit after 1 second.

So if we need to do special merge logic, we would need to set `setAllowNullNewExchange=true`.
If we didn't do this, then on timeout the append method would normally not be
invoked, meaning the xref:content-enricher.adoc[Content Enricher] did
not merge/change the message.

In XML DSL you would configure the `strategyMethodAllowNull` option and
set it to `true` as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <aggregate aggregationStrategy="myAppender"
                   aggregationStrategyMethodName="append"
                   aggregationStrategyMethodAllowNull="true"
                   completionSize="3">
            <correlationExpression>
                <constant>true</constant>
            </correlationExpression>
            <to uri="mock:result"/>
        </aggregate>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

=== Aggregating with different body types

When, for example, using `strategyMethodAllowNull` as `true`, then the
parameter type of the message bodies does not have to be the same.
For example suppose we want to aggregate from a `com.foo.User` type to a
`List<String>` that contains the name of the user. We could code a bean as follows:

[source,java]
----
public final class MyUserAppender {

    public List addUsers(List names, User user) {
        if (names == null) {
            names = new ArrayList();
        }
        names.add(user.getName());
        return names;
    }
}
----

Notice that the return type is a `List` which we want to contain the name of the users.
The first parameter is the `List` of names, and the second parameter is the incoming `com.foo.User` type.
