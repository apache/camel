The SetProperty EIP is used for setting a xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] property.

NOTE: An `Exchange` property is a key/value set as a `Map` on the `org.apache.camel.Exchange` instance.
This is *not* for setting xref:manual:ROOT:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders].

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Example

The following example shows how to set a property on the exchange in a Camel route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .setProperty("myProperty", constant("test"))
    .to("direct:b");
----

And the same example using XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <setProperty name="myProperty">
        <constant>test</constant>
    </setProperty>
    <to uri="direct:b"/>
</route>
----

=== Setting an exchange property from another exchange property

You can also set an exchange property with the value from another exchange property.

In the example we set the exchange property foo with the value from an existing exchange property named bar.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .setProperty("foo", exchangeProperty("bar"))
    .to("direct:b");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <setProperty name="foo">
        <exchangeProperty>bar</exchangeProperty>
    </setProperty>
    <to uri="direct:b"/>
</route>
----

=== Setting an exchange property with the current message body

It is of course also possible to set an exchange property with a value
from anything on the `Exchange` such as the message body:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .setProperty("myBody", body())
    .to("direct:b");
----

And in XML we use the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language
to refer to the message body:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <setProperty name="myBody">
        <simple>${body}</simple>
    </setProperty>
    <to uri="direct:b"/>
</route>
----
