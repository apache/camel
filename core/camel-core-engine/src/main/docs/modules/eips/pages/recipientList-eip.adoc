Camel supports the
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/RecipientList.html[Recipient List]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How do we route a message to a list of dynamically specified recipients?

image::eip/RecipientList.gif[image]

Define a channel for each recipient. Then use a Recipient List to inspect an incoming message, determine the list of desired recipients, and forward the message to all channels associated with the recipients in the list.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END


TIP: See the `cacheSize` option for more details on _how much cache_ to use depending on how many or few unique endpoints are used.

== Exchange properties

The following exchange properties are set on each `Exchange` that are sent by the recipient list:

[width="100%",cols="3,1m,6",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Property | Type | Description
| `CamelRecipientListEndpoint` | `String` | Uri of the `Endpoint` that the message was sent to.
|=======================================================================

== Using Recipient List

The Recipient List EIP allows to route *the same* message to a number of xref:manual::endpoint.adoc[endpoints]
and process them in a different way.

There can be 1 or more destinations, and Camel will execute them sequentially (by default).
However, a parallel mode exists which allows processing messages concurrently.

The Recipient List EIP has many features and is based on the xref:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] EIP.
For example the Recipient List EIP is capable of aggregating each message into a single
_response_ message as the result after the Recipient List EIP.

=== Using Static Recipient List

The following example shows how to route a request from an input queue:a endpoint
to a static list of destinations, using `constant`:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:a")
    .recipientList(constant("seda:x,seda:y,seda:z"));
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="jms:queue:a"/>
    <recipientList>
        <constant>seda:x,seda:y,seda:z</constant>
    </recipientList>
</route>
----

=== Using Dynamic Recipient List

Usually one of the main reasons for using the Recipient List pattern is that the list of recipients is dynamic and
calculated at runtime.

The following example demonstrates how to create a dynamic recipient list using an xref:manual::expression.adoc[Expression]
(which in this case extracts a named header value dynamically) to calculate the list of endpoints; which are either
of type `Endpoint` or are converted to a `String` and then resolved using the endpoint URIs (separated by comma).

In Java DSL its as easy as:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:a")
    .recipientList(header("foo"));
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="jms:queue:a"/>
    <recipientList>
        <header>foo</constant>
    </recipientList>
</route>
----

==== How is dynamic destinations evaluated

The dynamic list of recipients that are defined in the header must be iterable such as:

* `java.util.Collection`
* `java.util.Iterator`
* arrays
* `org.w3c.dom.NodeList`
* a single `String` with values separated by comma (the delimiter configured)
* any other type will be regarded as a single value


=== Configuring delimiter for dynamic destinations

In XML DSL you can set the delimiter attribute for setting a delimiter to be used if the header value is a single `String` with multiple separated endpoints.
By default, Camel uses comma as delimiter, but this option lets you specify a custom delimiter to use instead.

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:a"/>
  <!-- use semi-colon as a delimiter for String based values -->
  <recipientList delimiter=";">
    <header>myHeader</header>
  </recipientList>
</route>
----

So if *myHeader* contains a `String` with the value `"activemq:queue:foo;activemq:topic:hello ; log:bar"`
then Camel will split the `String` using the delimiter given in the XML that was comma, resulting into 3 endpoints to send to.
You can use spaces between the endpoints as Camel will trim the value when it look up the endpoint to send to.

And in Java DSL, you specify the delimiter as 2nd parameter as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .recipientList(header("myHeader"), ";");
----

=== Using parallel processing

The Recipient List supports `parallelProcessing` similar to what xref:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] and xref:split-eip.adoc[Split] EIPs have as well.
When using parallel processing then a thread pool is used to have concurrent tasks sending the `Exchange`
to multiple recipients concurrently.

You can enable parallel mode using `parallelProcessing` in Java as shown:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .recipientList(header("myHeader")).parallelProcessing();
----

And in XML it is an attribute on `<recipientList>`:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <recipientList parallelProcessing="true">
        <header>myHeader</header>
    </recipientList>
</route>
----

==== Using custom thread pool

A thread pool is only used for `parallelProcessing`. You supply your own custom thread pool via the `ExecutorServiceStrategy` (see Camel's Threading Model),
the same way you would do it for the `aggregationStrategy`. By default, Camel uses a thread pool with 10 threads (subject to change in future versions).

The Recipient List EIP will by default continue to process the entire exchange even in case one of the
sub messages will throw an exception during routing.

For example if you want to route to 3 destinations and the 2nd
destination fails by an exception. What Camel does by default is to
process the remainder destinations. You have the chance to deal with the exception
when aggregating using an `AggregationStrategy`.

But sometimes you just want Camel to stop and let the exception be
propagated back, and let the Camel xref:manual::error-handler.adoc[Error Handler]
handle it. You can do this by specifying that it should stop in case of an
exception occurred. This is done by the `stopOnException` option as
shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .recipientList(header("whereTo")).stopOnException()
    .to("mock:result");

    from("direct:foo").to("mock:foo");

    from("direct:bar").process(new MyProcessor()).to("mock:bar");

    from("direct:baz").to("mock:baz");
----

In this example suppose a message is sent with the header `whereTo=direct:foo,direct:bar,direct:baz`
that means the recipient list sends messages to those 3 endpoints.

Now suppose that the `MyProcessor` is causing a failure and throws an exception.
This means the Recipient List EIP will stop after this, and not the last route (direct:baz).

And using XML DSL you specify it as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <recipientList stopOnException="true">
            <header>whereTo</header>
        </recipientList>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:foo"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:bar"/>
        <process ref="myProcessor"/>
        <to uri="mock:bar"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:baz"/>
        <to uri="mock:baz"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

=== Ignore invalid endpoints

The Recipient List supports `ignoreInvalidEndpoints` (like xref:routingSlip-eip.adoc[Routing Slip] EIP).
You can use it to skip endpoints which are invalid.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .recipientList(header("myHeader")).ignoreInvalidEndpoints();
----

And in XML it is an attribute on `<recipientList>`:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <recipientList ignoreInvalidEndpoints="true">
        <header>myHeader</header>
    </recipientList>
</route>
----

Then let us say the `myHeader` contains the following two endpoints `direct:foo,xxx:bar`.
The first endpoint is valid and works. However, the second one is invalid and will just be ignored.
Camel logs at DEBUG level about it, so you can see why the endpoint was invalid.

=== Using timeout

If you use `parallelProcessing` then you can configure a total `timeout` value in millis.

Camel will then process the messages in parallel until the timeout is hit.
This allows you to continue processing if one message consumer is slow.
For example, you can set a timeout value of 20 sec.

[WARNING]
.Tasks may keep running
If the timeout is reached with running tasks still remaining, certain tasks for which it is difficult for Camel to shut down in a graceful manner may continue to run. So use this option with a bit of care.

For example in the unit test below you can see that we multicast the message to 3 destinations.
We have a timeout of 2 seconds, which means only the last two messages can be completed within the timeframe.
This means we will only aggregate the last two which yields a result aggregation which outputs "BC".

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .multicast(new AggregationStrategy() {
            public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {
                if (oldExchange == null) {
                    return newExchange;
                }

                String body = oldExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
                oldExchange.getIn().setBody(body + newExchange.getIn().getBody(String.class));
                return oldExchange;
            }
        })
        .parallelProcessing().timeout(250).to("direct:a", "direct:b", "direct:c")
    // use end to indicate end of multicast route
    .end()
    .to("mock:result");

from("direct:a").delay(1000).to("mock:A").setBody(constant("A"));

from("direct:b").to("mock:B").setBody(constant("B"));

from("direct:c").to("mock:C").setBody(constant("C"));
----

By default, if a timeout occurs the `AggregationStrategy` is not invoked. However, you can implement the `timeout` method:
This allows you to deal with the timeout in the `AggregationStrategy` if you really need to.

[NOTE]
.Timeout is total
====
The timeout is total, which means that after X time, Camel will aggregate the messages which have completed within the timeframe.
The remainders will be cancelled. Camel will also only invoke the `timeout` method in the `TimeoutAwareAggregationStrategy` once, for the first index which caused the timeout.
====

=== Using ExchangePattern in recipients

The recipient list will by default use the current Exchange Pattern. Though one can imagine use-cases where one wants to send
a message to a recipient using a different exchange pattern. For example, you may have a route that initiates as an `InOnly` route,
but want to use `InOut` exchange pattern with a recipient list. You can configure the exchange pattern directly in the
recipient endpoints.

For example in the route below we pick up new files (which will be started as `InOnly`) and then route to a recipient list.
As we want to use `InOut` with the ActiveMQ (JMS) endpoint we can now specify this using the `exchangePattern=InOut` option.
Then the response from the JMS request/reply will then be continued routed, and thus the response is what will be stored
in as a file in the outbox directory.

[source,java]
----
from("file:inbox")
    // the exchange pattern is InOnly initially when using a file route
    .recipientList().constant("activemq:queue:inbox?exchangePattern=InOut")
    .to("file:outbox");
----

[WARNING]
====
The recipient list will not alter the original exchange pattern. So in the example above the exchange pattern will still
be `InOnly` when the message is routed to the `file:outbox endpoint`.
If you want to alter the exchange pattern permanently then use `.setExchangePattern` in the route.

See more details at xref:event-message.adoc[Event Message] and xref:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request Reply] EIPs.
