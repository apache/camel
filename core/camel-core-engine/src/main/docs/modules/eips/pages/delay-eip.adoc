The Delay EIP is used for delaying messages during routing.

== Options

// eip options: START
The Delay EIP supports 3 options which are listed below:

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *executorServiceRef* | Refers to a custom Thread Pool if asyncDelay has been enabled. |  | String
| *asyncDelayed* | Enables asynchronous delay which means the thread will not block while delaying. | true | Boolean
| *callerRunsWhenRejected* | Whether or not the caller should run the task when it was rejected by the thread pool. Is by default true | true | Boolean
|===
// eip options: END

== Example

The example below will delay all messages received on *seda:b* 1 second before sending them to *mock:result*.

[source,java]
----
from("seda:b")
  .delay(1000)
  .to("mock:result");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="seda:b"/>
    <delay>
        <constant>1000</constant>
    </delay>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

The delayed value can be a dynamic xref:latest@manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression].

For example to delay a random between 1 and 5 seconds, we can use
the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:b")
  .delay(simple("${random(1000,5000)}"))
  .to("mock:result");
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="seda:b"/>
    <delay>
        <simple>${random(1000,5000)}</simple>
    </delay>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

You can also call a xref:components:languages:bean-language.adoc[Bean Method] to compute the
delayed value from Java code:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:foo")
  .delay().method("someBean", "computeDelay")
  .to("activemq:bar");
----

Then the bean would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeBean {
  public long computeDelay() {
     long delay = 0;
     // use java code to compute a delay value in millis
     return delay;
 }
}
----

== Asynchronous delaying

You can let the Delayer use non-blocking asynchronous delaying,
which means Camel will use scheduled thread pool (`ScheduledExecutorService`)
to schedule a task to be executed in the future.
This allows the caller thread to not block and be able to service other messages.

You use the `asyncDelayed()` to enable the async behavior.

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:queue:foo")
  .delay(1000).asyncDelayed()
  .to("activemq:aDelayedQueue");
----

In XML DSL you use the `asyncDelayed` attribute to enable the async mode:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
   <from uri="activemq:queue:foo"/>
   <delay asyncDelayed="true">
       <constant>1000</constant>
   </delay>
   <to uri="activemq:aDealyedQueue"/>
</route>
