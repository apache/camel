The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ContentBasedRouter.html[Content
Based Router] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns] allows you to route messages to the correct destination based
on the contents of the message exchanges.

== Choice options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Example

The Camel xref:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language
is great to use with the Choice EIP when routing is based on the content of the message,
such as checking message headers.

=== Why can I not use otherwise in Java DSL

When using the Choice EIP in the Java DSL you may have a situation where the compiler will not accept
`when()` or `otherwise()` statements.

For example as shown in the route below where we use the
xref:loadBalance-eip.adoc[Load Balancer] EIP inside the Choice EIP in the first when:

*Code will not compile*

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .choice()
        .when(body().contains("Camel"))
            .loadBalance().roundRobin().to("mock:foo").to("mock:bar")
        .otherwise()
            .to("mock:result");
----

Well the first issue is that the xref:loadBalance-eip.adoc[Load Balancer] EIP
uses the additional routing to know what to use in the load balancing.
In this example that would be the:

[source,java]
----
.to("mock:foo").to("mock:bar")
----

To indicate when the balancing stops, you should use `.end()` to denote
the end. So the route is updates as follows:

*Code will still not compile*

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .choice()
        .when(body().contains("Camel"))
            .loadBalance().roundRobin().to("mock:foo").to("mock:bar").end()
        .otherwise()
            .to("mock:result");
----

However, the code will still not compile.

The reason is we have stretched how far we can take the good old Java language in terms of
xref:manual::dsl.adoc[DSL]. In a more dynamic or modern language such as Kotlin or Groovy
you would be able to let it be stack based, so the `.end()` will pop the last type of the
stack, and you would return to the scope of the Choice EIP.

That's not doable in Java. So we need to help Java a bit, which you do by
using `.endChoice()`, which tells Camel to "pop the stack" and return
to the scope of the Choice EIP.

*Code compiles*

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .choice()
        .when(body().contains("Camel"))
            .loadBalance().roundRobin().to("mock:foo").to("mock:bar").endChoice()
        .otherwise()
            .to("mock:result");
----

You only need to use `.endChoice()` when using certain
xref:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP]s which often have additional
methods to configure or as part of the EIP itself. For example the
xref:split-eip.adoc[Split] EIP has a sub-route which denotes the
routing of each _split_ message. You would also have to use
`.endChoice()` to indicate the end of the sub-route and to return
to the Choice EIP.

==== Still problems

If there are still problems, then you can split your route into multiple
routes, and link them together using the xref:ROOT:direct-component.adoc[Direct]
component.

There can be some combinations of xref:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP]s
that can hit limits in how far we can take the fluent builder DSL with
generics you can do in Java programming language.

== Precondition Mode

In precondition mode, the Choice EIP is an optimized http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ContentBasedRouter.html[Content
Based Router] which selects a single branch (when/otherwise) during startup, and
always executes the same branch. This allows to optimize the runtime Camel to avoid
this evaluation process for every message; because they are supposed
to always be routed on the same branch.

NOTE: Because the Choice EIP in precondition mode evaluates the predicates during startup, then the predicates
cannot be based on the content of the message. Therefore, the predicates would often
be based on property placeholders, JVM system properties, or OS Environment variables.

The Choice EIP in precondition mode combined with xref:manual:ROOT:route-template.adoc[Route Templates] allows
for more flexible templates, as the template parameters can be used as the predicates in the Choice EIP;
meaning that the Choice EIP in precondition mode is fully parameterized, but is optimized for best runtime performance.

=== Example

The Camel xref:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language
is great to use with the Choice EIP in precondition mode to select a specific branch based
on xref:manual:ROOT:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders].

Here we select from the Switch the first predicate that matches. So if there is
a property placeholder with the key `foo` then its select, and so on.
Notice how we can use `{{?foo}}` to mark the property placeholder as optional.

TIP: Otherwise, is optional, and if none of the predicates would match, then no branches is selected.
