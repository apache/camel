Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageEndpoint.html[Message
Endpoint] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns] using the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface.

How does an application connect to a messaging channel to send and receive messages?

image::eip/MessageEndpointSolution.gif[image]

Connect an application to a messaging channel using a Message Endpoint, a client of the messaging system that the application can then use to send or receive messages.

In Camel the To EIP is used for sending xref:message.adoc[messages] to static xref:message-endpoint.adoc[endpoints].

The To and xref:toD-eip.adoc[ToD] EIPs are the most common patterns to use in Camel xref:manual:ROOT:routes.adoc[routes].

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

=== Different between To and ToD

The `to` is used for sending messages to a static xref:message-endpoint.adoc[endpoint].
In other words `to` sends message only to the *same* endpoint.

The `toD` is used for sending message to a dynamic xref:message-endpoint.adoc[endpoint].
The dynamic endpoint is evaluated _on-demand_ by an xref:manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression].
By default, the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] expression is used to compute
the dynamic endpoint URI.

== Using To

The following example route demonstrates the use of a xref:ROOT:file-component.adoc[File] consumer endpoint and a xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] producer endpoint,
by their xref:manual::uris.adoc[URIs]:
