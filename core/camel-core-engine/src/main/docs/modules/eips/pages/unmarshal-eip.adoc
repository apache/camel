= Unmarshal EIP
:tabs-sync-option:

The xref:marshal-eip.adoc[Marshal] and xref:unmarshal-eip.adoc[Unmarshal] EIPs are used
for xref:message-translator.adoc[Message Transformation].

image::eip/MessageTranslator.gif[image]

Camel has support for message transformation using several techniques.
One such technique is xref:dataformats:index.adoc[Data Formats],
where marshal and unmarshal come from.

So in other words, the xref:marshal-eip.adoc[Marshal] and xref:unmarshal-eip.adoc[Unmarshal] EIPs
are used with xref:dataformats:index.adoc[Data Formats].

- _Marshal_: Transforms the message body (such as Java object) into a binary or textual format, ready to be wired over the network.
- _Unmarshal_: Transforms data in some binary or textual format (such as received over the network)
into a Java object; or some other representation according to the data format being used.

== Example

The following example reads XML files from the inbox/xml directory.
Each file is then transformed into Java Objects using xref:dataformats:jaxb-dataformat.adoc[JAXB].
Then a xref:ROOT:bean-component.adoc[Bean] is invoked that takes in the Java object.

Then the reverse operation happens to transform the Java objects back into XML also via JAXB,
but using the `marshal` operation.
And finally, the message is routed to a xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] queue.

== Allow Null Body

Sometimes,
there are situations where `null` can be a normal value for the body of a message but `null` by default is not an accepted value to unmarshal.
To work around that,
it is possible to allow `null` as value to a body to unmarshall
using the option `allowNullBody` as shown in the next code snippets:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
// Beginning of the route
  .unmarshal().allowNullBody().jaxb()
// End of the route
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<!-- Beginning of the route -->
  <unmarshal allowNullBody="true"><jaxb/></unmarshal>
<!-- End of the route -->
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
# Beginning of the route
unmarshal:
  allowNullBody: true
  jaxb: {}
# End of the route
