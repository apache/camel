= Transactional Client

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/TransactionalClient.html[Transactional
Client] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns]
using JTA transactions.

How can a client control its transactions with the messaging system?

image::eip/TransactionalClientSolution.gif[image]

Use a Transactional Client—make the client’s session with the messaging system transactional so that the client can specify transaction boundaries.

Transactions are supported by Spring Transactions and also with a JTA Transaction Manager.

Traditionally a JTA Transaction Manager are included in JEE application servers.
However, when running microservice applications with Spring Boot, or Quarkus, then
a 3rd-party JTA transaction manager can be embedded and used.

In Camel transactions are supported by JMS messaging components:

- xref:ROOT:activemq-component.adoc[ActiveMQ]
- xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS]
- xref:ROOT:sjms-component.adoc[Simple JMS]
- xref:ROOT:sjms2-component.adoc[Simple JMS 2.x]

And all the SQL database components, such as:

- xref:ROOT:elsql-component.adoc[ElSQL]
- xref:ROOT:jdbc-component.adoc[JDBC]
- xref:ROOT:jpa-component.adoc[JPA]
- xref:ROOT:sql-component.adoc[SQL]
- xref:ROOT:mybatis-component.adoc[MyBatis]

== Understanding Transactions

A transaction is a series of events. The start of a transaction is often named begin, and
the end is commit (or rollback if the transaction isn’t successfully completed).

If you were to write in Java a locally managed transaction then it could be something like:

[source,java]
----
TransactionManager tm = ...
Transaction tx = tm.getTransaction();
try {
    tx.begin();
    // code here under transaction
    tx.commit();
} catch (Exception e) {
    tx.rollback();
}
----

You start the transaction using the `begin` method. Then you have a series of events to
do whatever work needs to be done. At the end, you either `commit` or `rollback` the
transaction, depending on whether an exception is thrown.

You may already be familiar with this principle, and transactions in Camel use the
same principle at a higher level of abstraction. In Camel transactions, you don’t invoke
begin and commit methods from Java code; you use declarative transactions, which can
be configured using Java code or in XML files. Camel doesn't reinvent the wheel and
implement a transaction manager, which is a complicated piece of technology to build.
Instead, Camel uses APIs from either `camel-spring` or `camel-jta`.

=== Local vs Global Transactions

TODO:

=== About Spring Transactions

Camel uses Spring Transaction to manage transactions via its `TransactionManager`
API. Depending on the kinds of resources that are taking part in the transaction,
an appropriate implementation of the transaction manager must be chosen. Spring
offers a number of transaction managers out of the box that work for various local
transactions such as JMS and JDBC. But for global transactions, you must use a third-party
JTA transaction manager implementation; JTA transaction manager is provided
by Java EE application servers. Spring doesn't offer that out of the box, only the necessary
API abstract that Camel uses.

== Using Transactions in Camel

TODO:

=== Transaction error handler

When a route is marked as transacted using ``<transacted/>` Camel will
automatically use `TransactionErrorHandler` as the
xref:latest@manual:ROOT:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler].

This error handler supports basically the same
feature set as the xref:latest@manual:ROOT:defaulterrorhandler.adoc[DefaultErrorHandler].

=== Transaction Policies

Outbound endpoints will automatically enlist in the current transaction
context. But what if you do not want your outbound endpoint to enlist in
the same transaction as your inbound endpoint? The solution is to add a
Transaction Policy to the processing route. You first have to define
transaction policies that you will be using. The policies use a spring
TransactionTemplate under the covers for declaring the transaction
demarcation to use. So you will need to add something like the following
to your spring xml:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="PROPAGATION_REQUIRED" class="org.apache.camel.spring.spi.SpringTransactionPolicy">
    <property name="transactionManager" ref="jmsTransactionManager"/>
</bean>

<bean id="PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW" class="org.apache.camel.spring.spi.SpringTransactionPolicy">
    <property name="transactionManager" ref="jmsTransactionManager"/>
    <property name="propagationBehaviorName" value="PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW"/>
</bean>
----

Then in your
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-spring/current/org/apache/camel/spring/SpringRouteBuilder.html[SpringRouteBuilder],
you just need to create new SpringTransactionPolicy objects for each of
the templates.

[source,java]
----
public void configure() {
    ...
    Policy required = bean(SpringTransactionPolicy.class, "PROPAGATION_REQUIRED"));
    Policy requirenew = bean(SpringTransactionPolicy.class, "PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW"));
    ...
}
----

Once created, you can use the Policy objects in your processing routes:

[source,java]
----
// Send to bar in a new transaction
from("activemq:queue:foo").policy(requirenew)
    .to("activemq:queue:bar");

// Send to bar without a transaction.
from("activemq:queue:foo").policy(notsupported)
    .to("activemq:queue:bar");
----

== Transaction example with database

In this sample we want to ensure that two endpoints is under transaction
control. These two endpoints inserts data into a database.

The sample is in its full as a
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/main/components/camel-spring-xml/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/spring/interceptor/TransactionalClientDataSourceMinimalConfigurationTest.java[unit test].

First we set up the usual spring stuff in its configuration file.
Here we have defined a DataSource to the HSQLDB and a most
importantly the Spring `DataSourceTransactionManager` that is doing the
heavy lifting of ensuring our transactional policies.

As we use the new convention over configuration we do *not* need to
configure a transaction policy bean, so we do not have any
`PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` beans. All the beans needed to be configured is
*standard* Spring beans only, there are no Camel specific configuration at all.

[source,xml]
----
<!-- this example uses JDBC so we define a data source -->
<jdbc:embedded-database id="dataSource" type="DERBY">
    <jdbc:script location="classpath:sql/init.sql" />
</jdbc:embedded-database>

<!-- spring transaction manager -->
<!-- this is the transaction manager Camel will use for transacted routes -->
<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>

<!-- bean for book business logic -->
<bean id="bookService" class="org.apache.camel.spring.interceptor.BookService">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>
----

Then we are ready to define our Camel routes. We have two routes: 1 for
success conditions, and 1 for a forced rollback condition.

This is after all based on a unit test. Notice that we mark each route
as transacted using the `<transacted/>` XML tag.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:okay"/>
        <!-- we mark this route as transacted. Camel will lookup the spring transaction manager
             and use it by default. We can optimally pass in arguments to specify a policy to use
             that is configured with a spring transaction manager of choice. However Camel supports
             convention over configuration as we can just use the defaults out of the box and Camel
             that suites in most situations -->
        <transacted/>
        <setBody>
            <constant>Tiger in Action</constant>
        </setBody>
        <bean ref="bookService"/>
        <setBody>
            <constant>Elephant in Action</constant>
        </setBody>
        <bean ref="bookService"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:fail"/>
        <!-- we mark this route as transacted. See comments above. -->
        <transacted/>
        <setBody>
            <constant>Tiger in Action</constant>
        </setBody>
        <bean ref="bookService"/>
        <setBody>
            <constant>Donkey in Action</constant>
        </setBody>
        <bean ref="bookService"/>
    </route>

</camelContext>
----

That is all that is needed to configure a Camel route as being transacted.
Just remember to use `<transacted/>`. The rest is standard Spring
XML to set up the transaction manager.

== Transaction example with JMS

In this sample we want to listen for messages on a queue and process the
messages with our business logic java code and send them along. Since
it is based on a
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/main/components/camel-jms/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/jms/tx/TransactionMinimalConfigurationTest.java[unit test]
the destination is a mock endpoint.

First we configure the standard Spring XML to declare a JMS connection
factory, a JMS transaction manager and our ActiveMQ component that we
use in our routing.

[source,xml]
----
<!-- setup JMS connection factory -->
<bean id="poolConnectionFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory" init-method="start" destroy-method="stop">
    <property name="maxConnections" value="8"/>
    <property name="connectionFactory" ref="jmsConnectionFactory"/>
</bean>

<bean id="jmsConnectionFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory">
    <property name="brokerURL" value="vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false&amp;broker.useJmx=false"/>
</bean>

<!-- setup spring jms TX manager -->
<bean id="jmsTransactionManager" class="org.springframework.jms.connection.JmsTransactionManager">
    <property name="connectionFactory" ref="poolConnectionFactory"/>
</bean>

<!-- define our activemq component -->
<bean id="activemq" class="org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent">
    <property name="connectionFactory" ref="poolConnectionFactory"/>
    <!-- define the jms consumer/producer as transacted -->
    <property name="transacted" value="true"/>
    <!-- setup the transaction manager to use -->
    <!-- if not provided then Camel will automatic use a JmsTransactionManager, however if you
         for instance use a JTA transaction manager then you must configure it -->
    <property name="transactionManager" ref="jmsTransactionManager"/>
</bean>
----

And then we configure our routes. Notice that all we have to do is mark the
route as transacted using the `<transacted/>` XML tag.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <!-- 1: from the jms queue -->
        <from uri="activemq:queue:okay"/>
        <!-- 2: mark this route as transacted -->
        <transacted/>
        <!-- 3: call our business logic that is myProcessor -->
        <process ref="myProcessor"/>
        <!-- 4: if success then send it to the mock -->
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----
