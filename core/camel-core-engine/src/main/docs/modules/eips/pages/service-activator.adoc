= Service Activator

Camel supports the
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingAdapter.html[Service Activator]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] book.

How can an application design a service to be invoked both via various messaging technologies and via non-messaging techniques?

Design a Service Activator that connects the messages on the channel to the service being accessed.

Camel has several xref:components::index.adoc[Components] that support the Service Activator EIP.

Components like xref:components::bean-component.adoc[Bean] and xref:components::bean-component.adoc[CXF]
provide a way to bind the message xref:latest@manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] to a Java interface/service
where the route defines the endpoints and wires it up to the bean.

In addition, you can use the xref:latest@manual:ROOT:bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration] to wire messages
to a bean using Java annotation.

== Example

Here is a simple example of using a xref:components::direct-component.adoc[Direct] endpoint
to create a messaging interface to a POJO xref:components::bean-component.adoc[Bean] service.

Using Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:invokeMyService")
  .to("bean:myService");
----

Using the XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:invokeMyService"/>
  <to uri="bean:myService"/>
</route>
----
