= Message Dispatcher

Camel supports the
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageDispatcher.html[Message Dispatcher]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] book.

In Apache Camel, the Message Dispatcher can be achieved in different ways such as:

* You can use a component like xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] with selectors
to implement a xref:selective-consumer.adoc[Selective Consumer] as the Message Dispatcher implementation.

* Or you can use a xref:message-endpoint.adoc[Message Endpoint] as the Message Dispatcher itself, or
  combine this with the xref:choice-eip.adoc[Content-Based Router] as the Message Dispatcher.
