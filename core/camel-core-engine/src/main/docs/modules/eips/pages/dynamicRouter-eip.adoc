The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/DynamicRouter.html[Dynamic
Router] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns]
allows you to route messages while avoiding the dependency of the router
on all possible destinations while maintaining its efficiency.

== Dynamic Router

The Dynamic Router is similar to the xref:routingSlip-eip.adoc[Routing Slip] EIP,
but with the slip evaluated dynamically _on-the-fly_. The xref:routingSlip-eip.adoc[Routing Slip]
on the other hand evaluates the slip only once in the beginning.

The Dynamic Router sets the exchange property (`Exchange.SLIP_ENDPOINT`)
with the current slip. This allows you to know how far we have processed in the overall slip.

== Example

In Java DSL you can use the `dynamicRouter` as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    // use a bean as the dynamic router
    .dynamicRouter(method(MySlipBean.class, "slip"));
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <dynamicRouter>
        <!-- use a method call on a bean as dynamic router -->
        <method beanType="com.foo.MySlipBean" method="slip"/>
    </dynamicRouter>
</route>
----

Which will call a xref:languages:bean-language.adoc[Bean Method] to compute the slip
_on-the-fly_. The bean could be implemented as follows:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Use this method to compute dynamic where we should route next.
 *
 * @param body the message body
 * @return endpoints to go, or <tt>null</tt> to indicate the end
 */
public String slip(String body) {
    bodies.add(body);
    invoked++;
 
    if (invoked == 1) {
        return "mock:a";
    } else if (invoked == 2) {
        return "mock:b,mock:c";
    } else if (invoked == 3) {
        return "direct:foo";
    } else if (invoked == 4) {
        return "mock:result";
    }
 
    // no more so return null
    return null;
}
----

WARNING: *Beware*
You must ensure the expression used for the `dynamicRouter` such as a
bean, will return `null` to indicate the end. Otherwise, the
`dynamicRouter` will keep repeating endlessly.

=== Thread safety beans

Mind that this example is only for show and tell. The current
implementation is not thread safe. You would have to store the state on
the `Exchange`, to ensure thread safety, as shown
below:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Use this method to compute dynamic where we should route next.
 *
 * @param body the message body
 * @param properties the exchange properties where we can store state between invocations
 * @return endpoints to go, or <tt>null</tt> to indicate the end
 */
public String slip(String body, @ExchangeProperties Map<String, Object> properties) {
    bodies.add(body);
 
    // get the state from the exchange properties and keep track how many times
    // we have been invoked
    int invoked = 0;
    Object current = properties.get("invoked");
    if (current != null) {
        invoked = Integer.valueOf(current.toString());
    }
    invoked++;
    // and store the state back on the properties
    properties.put("invoked", invoked);
 
    if (invoked == 1) {
        return "mock:a";
    } else if (invoked == 2) {
        return "mock:b,mock:c";
    } else if (invoked == 3) {
        return "direct:foo";
    } else if (invoked == 4) {
        return "mock:result";
    }
 
    // no more so return null
    return null;
}
----

You could also store state as message headers, but they are not
guaranteed to be preserved during routing, whereas properties on the
Exchange are.

== @DynamicRouter annotation

You can also use xref:manual::bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration] with the `@DynamicRouter` annotation,
on a Java bean method.

In the example below the `route` method would
then be invoked repeatedly as the message is processed dynamically. The
idea is to return the next endpoint uri where to go, and to return `null` to end.
You can return multiple endpoints if you like, just as
the xref:routingSlip-eip.adoc[Routing Slip], where each endpoint is separated by a comma.

[source,java]
----
public class MyDynamicRouter {

    @Consume(uri = "activemq:foo")
    @DynamicRouter
    public String route(@XPath("/customer/id") String customerId, @Header("Location") String location, Document body) {
        // query a database to find the best match of the endpoint based on the input parameters
        // return the next endpoint uri, where to go. Return null to indicate the end.
    }
}
----

The parameters on the `route` method is bound to information from the Exchange using
xref:manual::bean-binding.adoc[Bean Parameter Binding].
