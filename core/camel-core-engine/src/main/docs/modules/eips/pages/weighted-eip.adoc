= Weighted EIP
:doctitle: Weighted
:shortname: weighted
:description: Weighted load balancer The weighted load balancing policy allows you to specify a processing load distribution ratio for each server with respect to others. In addition to the weight, endpoint selection is then further refined using random distribution based on weight.

Weighted Load Balancer, with this policy in case of failures the exchange will be tried on the next endpoint.

== Options

// eip options: START

// eip options: END

== Examples

In this case we are using the header test as correlation expression:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance()
    .weighted(false, "4,2,1")
    .to("seda:x", "seda:y", "seda:z");
----

In XML you'll have a route like this

[source,xml]
----
<from uri="direct:start"/> 
  <loadBalance> 
    <weighted roundRobin="false" distributionRatio="4 2 1"/> 
    <to uri="seda:x"/> 
    <to uri="seda:y"/> 
    <to uri="seda:z"/> 
  </loadBalance>
----
