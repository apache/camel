:description: Uses a weighted load distribution ratio for each server with respect to others.
:since: 
:supportlevel: Stable
:tabs-sync-option:

Weighted mode for xref:loadBalance-eip.adoc[Load Balancer] EIP.
With this policy in case of failures the exchange will be tried on the next endpoint.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Examples

In this example we want to send the most message to the first endpoint, then the second, and only a few to the last.

The distribution ratio is 7 = 4 + 2 + 1.
This means that for every 7 message then 4 goes to the 1st, 2 for the 2nd, and 1 for the last.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance().weighted(false, "4,2,1")
        .to("seda:x")
        .to("seda:y")
        .to("seda:z")
    .end();
----

In XML you'll have a route like this:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
      <loadBalance>
        <weighted distributionRatio="4 2 1"/>
        <to uri="seda:x"/>
        <to uri="seda:y"/>
        <to uri="seda:z"/>
      </loadBalance>
</route>
