Every Camel xref:manual::routes.adoc[route] starts from an xref:manual::endpoint.adoc[Endpoint]
as the input (source) to the route.

The From EIP is the input.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Example

In the route below the route starts from
a xref:ROOT:file-component.adoc[File] endpoint.

[source,java]
----
from("file:inbox")
  .to("log:inbox");

And the same example in XML DSL:

</route>
