Every Camel xref:manual::routes.adoc[route] starts from an xref:manual::endpoint.adoc[Endpoint]
as the input (source) to the route.

The `from` EIP is the input.

NOTE: the Java DSL also provides a `fromF` EIP, which can be used to avoid concatenating route parameters and making the code harder to read.
