= Message

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Message.html[Message] from
the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] using the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Message.html[Message]
interface.

The `org.apache.camel.Message` is the _data record_ that represents the message part
of the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange].

The message contains the following information:

- _body_ - the message body (i.e. payload)
- _headers_ - headers with additional information
- _messageId_ - Unique id of the message.
  By default, the message uses the same id as `Exchange.getExchangeId` as messages are associated with the
  `Exchange` and using different IDs does not offer much value. Another reason is to optimize for performance to avoid generating new IDs.
  A few Camel components do provide their own message IDs such as the JMS components.
- _timestamp_ - The timestamp the message originates from.
  Some systems like JMS, Kafka, AWS have a timestamp on the event/message, that Camel received.
  This method returns the timestamp, if a timestamp exists.
