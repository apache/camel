= Message

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Message.html[Message] from
the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] using the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Message.html[Message]
interface.

The `org.apache.camel.Message` is the _data record_ that represents the message part
of the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange].

The message contains the following information:

- `_body_`: the message body (i.e., payload)
- `_headers_`: headers with additional information
- `_messageId_`: Unique id of the message.
  By default, the message uses the same id as `Exchange.getExchangeId` as messages are associated with the
  `Exchange` and using different IDs offers little value.
Another reason is to optimize for performance to avoid generating new IDs.
  A few Camel components do provide their own message IDs such as the JMS components.
- `_timestamp_`: the timestamp the message originates from.
Some systems like JMS, Kafka, AWS have a timestamp on the event/message that Camel receives.
This method returns the timestamp if a timestamp exists.
