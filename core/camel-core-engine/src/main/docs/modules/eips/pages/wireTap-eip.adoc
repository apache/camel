= Wire Tap EIP
:doctitle: Wire Tap
:shortname: wireTap
:description: Routes a copy of a message (or creates a new message) to a secondary destination while continue routing the original message.
:since: 
:supportlevel: Stable

http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/WireTap.html[Wire Tap]
(from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns])
allows you to route messages to a separate location while they are being
forwarded to the ultimate destination.

== Streams

If you xref:wireTap-eip.adoc[Wire Tap] a stream message body then you
should consider enabling xref:manual:ROOT:stream-caching.adoc[Stream caching] to
ensure the message body can be read at each endpoint. See more details
at xref:manual:ROOT:stream-caching.adoc[Stream caching].

TIP: See the `cacheSize` option for more details on _how much cache_ to use depending on how many or few unique endpoints are used.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== WireTap Thread pool

The WireTap uses a thread pool to process the
tapped messages. This thread pool will by default use the settings
detailed at xref:manual:ROOT:threading-model.adoc[Threading Model]. In particular,
when the pool is exhausted (with all threads utilized), further wiretaps
will be executed synchronously by the calling thread. To remedy this,
you can configure an explicit thread pool on the xref:wireTap-eip.adoc[Wire
Tap] having either a different rejection policy, a larger worker queue,
or more worker threads.

== WireTap Node

Camel's Wire Tap node supports two flavors when tapping an
xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]:

- With the traditional Wire Tap, Camel will copy the original
xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] and set its
xref:manual:ROOT:exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern] to *`InOnly`*, as we want
the tapped xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] to be sent in a fire and forget
style. The tapped xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is then sent in a
separate thread so it can run in parallel with the original. Beware that
only the Exchange is copied - Wire Tap won't do a deep clone (unless you
specify a custom processor via *`onPrepareRef`* which does that). So all
copies could share objects from the original Exchange.
- Camel also provides an option of sending a new
xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] allowing you to populate it with new
values.

                from("direct:start")
                    .to("log:foo")
                    .wireTap("direct:tap")
                    .to("mock:result");
                // END SNIPPET: e1

                from("direct:tap")
                    .delay(1000).setBody().constant("Tapped")
                    .to("mock:result", "mock:tap");
                
                from("direct:test").wireTap("direct:a").id("wiretap_1").to("mock:a");
                from("direct:a").to("mock:b");
            }
        };
    }
----

== Sending a New xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]

Camel supports either a processor or an
xref:manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression] to populate the new
xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]. Using a processor gives you full power
over how the xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is populated as you can set
properties, headers, etc. An xref:manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression] can only
be used to set the *`IN`* body.

The xref:manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression] or
xref:manual:ROOT:processor.adoc[Processor] is pre-populated with a copy of the
original xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange], which allows you to access the
original message when you prepare a new xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange] to
be sent. You can use the *`copy`* option (enabled by default) to
indicate whether you want this.

Below is the processor variation,
where we disable *`copy`* by passing in *`false`* to create a new, empty
xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange]

[source,java]

    public void testFireAndForgetUsingProcessor() throws Exception {
        context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() throws Exception {
                // START SNIPPET: e1
                from("direct:start")
                    .wireTap("direct:foo").copy(false).newExchange(exchange -> {
                        exchange.getIn().setBody("Bye World");
                        exchange.getIn().setHeader("foo", "bar");
                    }).to("mock:result");

                from("direct:foo").to("mock:foo");
                // END SNIPPET: e1
            }
        });
    }
----


== Using Dynamic URIs

For example to wire tap to a dynamic URI, then it supports the same
dynamic URIs as documented in xref:message-endpoint.adoc[Message
Endpoint]. For example to wire tap to a JMS queue where the header ID is
part of the queue name:

[source,java]
----
    from("direct:start") .wireTap("jms:queue:backup-$\{header.id}")
        .to("bean:doSomething");

== Sending a New exchange and Set Headers in DSL

If you send a new message using xref:wireTap-eip.adoc[Wire Tap], then you
could only set the message body using an
xref:manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression] from the DSL. If you also need to set
headers, you would have to use a xref:manual:ROOT:processor.adoc[Processor]. From
It's possible to set headers as well using the DSL.

The following example sends a new message which has

* *`Bye World`* as message body.
* A header with key *`id`* with the value *`123`*.
* A header with key *`date`* which has current date as value.

    @Override
    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() throws Exception {
                // START SNIPPET: e1
                from("direct:start")
                    // tap a new message and send it to direct:tap
                    // the new message should be Bye World with 2 headers
                    .wireTap("direct:tap")
                        // create the new tap message body and headers
                        .newExchangeBody(constant("Bye World"))
                        .newExchangeHeader("id", constant(123))
                        .newExchangeHeader("date", simple("${date:now:yyyyMMdd}"))
                    .end()
                    // here we continue routing the original messages
                    .to("mock:result");

                // this is the tapped route
                from("direct:tap")
                    .to("mock:tap");
                // END SNIPPET: e1
            }
        };
    }
