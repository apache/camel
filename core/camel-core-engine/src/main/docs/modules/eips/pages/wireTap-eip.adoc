from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns]
allows you to route messages to a separate location while they are being
forwarded to the ultimate destination.

== Wire Tap

Camel's Wire Tap will copy the original
xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] and set its
xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern] to *`InOnly`*, as we want
the tapped xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] to be sent in a fire and forget
style. The tapped xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] is then sent in a
separate thread, so it can run in parallel with the original. Beware that
only the `Exchange` is copied - Wire Tap won't do a deep clone (unless you
specify a custom processor via *`onPrepare`* which does that). So all
copies could share objects from the original `Exchange`.

=== Using Wire Tap

In the example below the exchange is wire tapped to the direct:tap route.
This route delays the message 1 second before continuing. This is because
it allows you to see that the tapped message is routed independently of the original
route, so that you would see log:result happens before log:tap

=== Wire tapping with dynamic URIs

For example to wire tap to a dynamic URI, then the URI
uses the  xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language that
allows to construct dynamic URIs.

For example to wire tap to a JMS queue where the header ID is part of the queue name:

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .wireTap("jms:queue:backup-${header.id}")
    .to("bean:doSomething");

XML::

<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <wireTap uri="jms:queue:backup-${header.id}"/>
  <to uri="bean:doSomething"/>
</route>

    steps:
      - wireTap:
          uri: jms:queue:backup-${header.id}
      - to:
          uri: bean:doSomething

== WireTap Thread Pools

The WireTap uses a thread pool to process the
tapped messages. This thread pool will by default use the settings
detailed at xref:manual::threading-model.adoc[Threading Model].

In particular, when the pool is exhausted (with all threads utilized), further wiretaps
will be executed synchronously by the calling thread. To remedy this,
you can configure an explicit thread pool on the Wire Tap having either
a different rejection policy, a larger worker queue, or more worker threads.

== Wire tapping Streaming based messages

If you Wire Tap a stream message body then you
should consider enabling xref:manual::stream-caching.adoc[Stream caching] to
ensure the message body can be read at each endpoint.

See more details at xref:manual::stream-caching.adoc[Stream caching].
