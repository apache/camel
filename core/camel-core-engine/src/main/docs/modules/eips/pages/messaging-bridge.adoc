Camel supports the

from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How can multiple messaging systems be connected so that messages available on one are also available on the others?

Use a Messaging Bridge, a connection between messaging systems, to replicate messages between systems.

You can use Camel to bridge different systems using Camel components and routes.

A basic bridge between two queues can be done with a Camel route:

[source,java]
----
from("mq:queue:foo")
  .to("activemq:queue:foo")
----

Another alternative is to bridge systems using xref:change-data-capture.adoc[Change Data Capture].
