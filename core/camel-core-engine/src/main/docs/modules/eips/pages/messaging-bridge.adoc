= Messaging Bridge
:tabs-sync-option:

Camel supports the
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html[Messaging Bridge]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How can multiple messaging systems be connected so that messages available on one are also available on the others?

Use a Messaging Bridge, a connection between messaging systems, to replicate messages between systems.

You can use Camel to bridge different systems using Camel xref:ROOT:index.adoc[Components]
and bridge the endpoints together in a xref:manual::routes.adoc[Route].

Another alternative is to bridge systems using xref:change-data-capture.adoc[Change Data Capture].

== Example

A basic bridge between two messaging systems (such as WebsphereMQ and xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] broker)
can be done with a single Camel route:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("mq:queue:foo")
  .to("jms:queue:foo")
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="mq:queue:foo"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
</route>
----
