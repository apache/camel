Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/DataEnricher.html[Content
Enricher] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns].

image::eip/DataEnricher.gif[image]

In Camel the Content Enricher can be done in several ways:

* Using xref:enrich-eip.adoc[Enrich] EIP, xref:pollEnrich-eip.adoc[Poll Enrich], or xref:poll-eip.adoc[Poll] EIP
* Using a xref:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator]
* Using a xref:manual::processor.adoc[Processor] with the enrichment programmed in Java
* Using a xref:bean-eip.adoc[Bean] EIP with the enrichment programmed in Java

The Poll EIP is a simplified xref:pollEnrich-eip.adoc[Poll Enrich] which only supports:

* Static Endpoints
* No custom aggregation or other advanced features
* Uses a 20 seconds timeout (default)

== Polling a message using Poll EIP

`poll` uses a xref:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling Consumer] to obtain the data.
It is usually used for xref:event-message.adoc[Event Message] messaging,
for instance, to read a file or download a file using FTP.

We have three methods when polling:

* `receive`: Waits until a message is available and then returns it. *Warning* that this method could block indefinitely if no messages are available.
* `receiveNoWait`: Attempts to receive a message exchange immediately without waiting and returning `null` if a message exchange is not available yet.
* `receive(timeout)`: Attempts to receive a message exchange, waiting up to the given timeout to expire if a message is not yet available. Returns the message or `null` if the timeout expired.

=== Timeout

By default, Camel will use the `receive(timeout)` which has a 20 seconds timeout.

You can pass in a timeout value that determines which method to use:

* if timeout is `-1` or other negative number then `receive` is selected (*Important:* the `receive` method may block if there is no message)
* if timeout is `0` then `receiveNoWait` is selected
* otherwise, `receive(timeout)` is selected

The timeout values are in milliseconds.

=== Using Poll

For example to download an FTP file:

[source,xml]
----
<rest path="/report">
    <description>Report REST API</description>
    <get path="/{id}/payload">
        <route id="report-payload-download">
            <poll uri="ftp:myserver.com/myfolder?fileName=report-file.pdf"/>
        </route>
    </get>
</rest>
----

NOTE: You can use dynamic values using the simple language in the uri, as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<rest path="/report">
    <description>Report REST API</description>
    <get path="/{id}/payload">
        <route id="report-payload-download">
            <poll uri="ftp:myserver.com/myfolder?fileName=report-${header.id}.pdf"/>
        </route>
    </get>
</rest>
----

=== Using Poll with Rest DSL

You can also use `poll` with xref:manual::rest-dsl.adoc[Rest DSL] to,
for example, download a file from xref:ROOT:aws2-s3-component.adoc[AWS S3] as the response of an API call.

[source,xml]
----
<rest path="/report">
    <description>Report REST API</description>
    <get path="/{id}/payload">
        <route id="report-payload-download">
            <poll uri="aws-s3:xavier-dev?amazonS3Client=#s3client&amp;deleteAfterRead=false&amp;fileName=report-file.pdf"/>
        </route>
    </get>
</rest>
