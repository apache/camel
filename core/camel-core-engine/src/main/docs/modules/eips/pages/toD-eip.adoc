Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageEndpoint.html[Message
Endpoint] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns] using the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface.

How does an application connect to a messaging channel to send and receive messages?

image::eip/MessageEndpointSolution.gif[image]

Connect an application to a messaging channel using a Message Endpoint, a client of the messaging system that the application can then use to send or receive messages.

In Camel the ToD EIP is used for sending xref:message.adoc[messages] to dynamic xref:message-endpoint.adoc[endpoints].

The xref:to-eip.adoc[To] and ToD EIPs are the most common patterns to use in Camel xref:manual::routes.adoc[routes].

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

=== Different between To and ToD

The `to` is used for sending messages to a static xref:message-endpoint.adoc[endpoint].
In other words `to` sends message only to the *same* endpoint.

The `toD` is used for sending message to a dynamic xref:message-endpoint.adoc[endpoint].
The dynamic endpoint is evaluated _on-demand_ by an xref:manual::expression.adoc[Expression].
By default, the xref:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] expression is used to compute
the dynamic endpoint URI.

== Using ToD

For example to send a message to an endpoint which is dynamic determined by a
xref:message.adoc[message header] you can do as shown below:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .toD("${header.foo}");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <toD uri="${header.foo}"/>
</route>
----
====

You can also prefix the uri with a value because the endpoint xref:manual::uris.adoc[URI] is
evaluated using the xref:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .toD("mock:${header.foo}");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <toD uri="mock:${header.foo}"/>
</route>
----
====

In the example above we compute the dynamic endpoint with a prefix "mock:" and
then the header foo is appended. So for example if the header foo has
value order, then the endpoint is computed as "mock:order".

=== Using other languages with toD

You can also use other languages such as xref:languages:xpath-language.adoc[XPath].
Doing this requires to start with `language:` as shown below. If you do not
specify `language:` then the endpoint is a component name. And in some
cases there is both a component and language with the same name such as
xquery.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .toD("language:xpath:/order/@uri");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <toD uri="language:xpath:/order/@uri"/>
</route>
----
====

=== Avoid creating endless dynamic endpoints which takes up resources

When using dynamic computed endpoints with `toD` then you may compute a lot of dynamic endpoints,
which results in an overhead of resources in use, by each dynamic endpoint uri, and its associated producer.

For example HTTP based endpoints where you may have dynamic values in URI parameters when calling the HTTP service, such as:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080/login?userid=${header.userName}");
----

In the example above then the parameter `userid` is dynamic computed, and would result in one instance of endpoint and producer
for each different userid. To avoid having too many dynamic endpoints you can configure `toD` to reduce its cache size, for example
to use a cache size of 10:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080/login?userid=${header.userName}", 10);
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:login"/>
  <toD uri="http:myloginserver:8080/login?userid=${header.userName}" cacheSize="10"/>
</route>
----
====

IMPORTANT: this will only reduce the endpoint cache of the `toD` that has a chance
of being reused in case a message is routed with the same `userName` header. Therefore, reducing the cache size
will not solve the _endless dynamic endpoint`s_ problem. Instead, you should use static endpoints with `to` and
provide the dynamic parts in Camel message headers (if possible).

==== Using static endpoints to avoid endless dynamic endpoints

In the example above then the parameter `userid` is dynamic computed, and would result in one instance of endpoint and producer
for each different userid. To avoid having too dynamic endpoints you use a single static endpoint and use headers to provide the dynamic parts:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH, constant("/login"))
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_QUERY, simple("userid=${header.userName}"))
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080");
----

However, you can use optimised components for `toD` that can _solve_ this out of the box,
as documented next.

=== Using optimised components with toD

A better solution would be if the HTTP component could be optimised to handle the variations of dynamic computed endpoint uris.
This is with among the following components, which have been optimised for `toD`:

- camel-http
- camel-jetty
- camel-netty-http
- camel-undertow
- camel-vertx-http

A number of non-HTTP components has been optimised as well:

- camel-amqp
- camel-file
- camel-ftp
- camel-jms
- camel-kafka
- camel-paho-mqtt5
- camel-paho
- camel-sjms
- camel-sjms2
- camel-spring-rabbitmq

For the optimisation to work, then:

. The optimisation is detected and activated during startup of the Camel routes with `toD`.
. The dynamic uri in `toD` must provide the component name as either static or resolved via xref:manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders].
. The supported components must be on the classpath.

The HTTP based components will be optimised to use the same hostname:port for each endpoint, and the dynamic values
for context-path and query parameters will be provided as headers:

For example this route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080/login?userid=${header.userName}");
----

Will essentially be optimised to (pseudo route):

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH, expression("/login"))
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_QUERY, expression("userid=${header.userName}"))
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080")
  .removeHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH)
  .removeHeader(Exchange.HTTP_QUERY);
----

Where _expression_ will be evaluated dynamically. Notice how the uri in `toD` is now static (`http:myloginserver:8080`).
This optimisation allows Camel to reuse the same endpoint and its associated producer for all dynamic variations.
This yields much lower resource overhead as the same http producer will be used for all the different variations of userid's.

[NOTE]
====
When the optimised component is in use, then you cannot use the headers `Exchange.HTTP_PATH` and `Exchange.HTTP_QUERY`
to provide dynamic values to override the uri in `toD`. If you want to use these headers, then use the plain `to` DSL instead.
In other words these headers are used internally by `toD` to carry the dynamic details of the endpoint.
====

In case of problems then you can turn on DEBUG logging level on `org.apache.camel.processor.SendDynamicProcessor` which will log
during startup if `toD` was optimised, or if there was a failure loading the optimised component, with a stacktrace logged.
