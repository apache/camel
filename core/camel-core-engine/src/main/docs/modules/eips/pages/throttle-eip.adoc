The Throttler Pattern allows you to ensure that a specific endpoint does not get overloaded, or that we don't exceed an agreed SLA with some external service.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Samples

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(3).timePeriodMillis(10000)
  .to("log:result", "mock:result");
----

So the above example will throttle messages all messages received on *seda:a* before being sent to *mock:result* ensuring that a maximum of 3 messages are sent in any 10 second window.
Note that since `timePeriodMillis` defaults to 1000 milliseconds, just setting the `maximumRequestsPerPeriod` has the effect of setting the maximum number of requests per second. So to throttle requests at 100 requests per second between two endpoints, it would look more like this...

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(100)
  .to("seda:b");
----

For further examples of this pattern in use you could look at the junit test case.

And an example in XML
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <!-- throttle 3 messages per 10 sec -->
  <throttle timePeriodMillis="10000">
    <constant>3</constant>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="log:result"/>
  <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

== Dynamically changing maximum requests per period

Since we use an Expression you can adjust this value at runtime, for example you can provide a header with the value. At runtime Camel evaluates the expression and converts the result to a `java.lang.Long` type. In the example below we use a header from the message to determine the maximum requests per period. If the header is absent, then the Throttler uses the old value. So that allows you to only provide a header if the value is to be changed:
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:expressionHeader"/>
  <throttle timePeriodMillis="500">
    <!-- use a header to determine how many messages to throttle per 0.5 sec -->
    <header>throttleValue</header>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="log:result"/>
  <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

== Asynchronous delaying

You can let the Throttler use non blocking asynchronous delaying, which means Camel will use a scheduler to schedule a task to be executed in the future. The task will then continue routing. This allows the caller thread to not block and be able to service other messages, etc.

[source,java]
---------------------
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(100).asyncDelayed()
  .to("seda:b");
---------------------
