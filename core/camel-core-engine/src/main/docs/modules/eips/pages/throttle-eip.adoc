How can I throttle messages to ensure that a specific endpoint does not get overloaded, or we donâ€™t exceed an agreed SLA with some external service?

Use a Throttler that controls the rate how many or fast messages are flowing to the endpoint.

== Using Throttle

The below example will throttle messages received on seda:a before being sent to mock:result
ensuring that a maximum of 3 messages are sent during a running 10-seconds window slot.

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(3).timePeriodMillis(10000)
  .to("mock:result");
----

To use 10-seconds window we set the `timePeriodMillis` to ten-thousand. The default value is 1000 (i.e. 1 second),
meaning that setting just `throttle(3)` has the effect of setting the maximum number of requests per second.

To throttle by 50 requests per second, would look like this:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(50)
  .to("seda:b");
----

And the same examples but in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <throttle timePeriodMillis="10000">
    <constant>3</constant>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

And to throttle 50 messages per second:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <throttle>
    <constant>50</constant>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

=== Dynamically changing maximum requests per period

The Throttler uses an xref:manual:ROOT:expression.adoc[Expression]
to configure the number of requests. In all the examples from above, we used
a xref:components:languages:constant-language.adoc[constant]. However, the expression can
be dynamic, such as determined from a message header from the current `Exchange`.

At runtime Camel evaluates the expression and converts the result to a `java.lang.Long` type.
In the example below we use a header from the message to determine the maximum requests per period.
If the header is absent, then the Throttler uses the old value. This allows you to only provide a header if the value is to be changed:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(header("throttleValue")).timePeriodMillis(500)
  .to("seda:b")
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <throttle timePeriodMillis="500">
    <!-- use a header to determine how many messages to throttle per 0.5 sec -->
    <header>throttleValue</header>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="seda:b"/>
</route>
----

=== Asynchronous delaying

You can let the Throttler use non-blocking asynchronous delaying,
which means Camel will use a scheduler to schedule a task to be executed in the future.
The task will then continue routing. This allows the caller thread to not block and be able to service other messages, etc.

In Java DSL you enable asynchronous delaying using `asyncDelayed` as shown:

[source,java]
---------------------
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(100).asyncDelayed()
  .to("seda:b");
---------------------

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <throttle timePeriodMillis="100" asyncDelayed="true">
    <constant>100</constant>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="seda:b"/>
</route>
----

=== Rejecting processing if rate limit hit

When a message is being _throttled_ due the maximum request per limit has been reached, then
the Throttler will by default wait until there is _free space_ before continue routing the message.

Instead of waiting you can also configure the Throttler to reject the message by throwing `ThrottlerRejectedExecutionException`
exception.

[source,java]
---------------------
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(100).rejectExecution(true)
  .to("seda:b");
---------------------

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <throttle timePeriodMillis="100" rejectExecution="true">
    <constant>100</constant>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="seda:b"/>
</route>
----

=== Throttling per group

The Throttler will by default throttle all messages in the same group. However, it is possible to use
a _correlation expression_ to diving into multiple groups, where each group is throttled independently.

For example, you can throttle by a xref:message.adoc[message] header as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
---------------------
from("seda:a")
  .throttle(100).correlationExpression(header("region"))
  .to("seda:b");
---------------------

In the example above messages are throttled by the header with name region.
So suppose there are regions for US, EMEA, and ASIA, then we have three different groups, that each
are throttled by 100 messages per second.

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <throttle>
    <constant>100</constant>
    <correlationExpression>
      <header>region</header>
    </correlationExpression>
  </throttle>
  <to uri="seda:b"/>
</route>
