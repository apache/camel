How can I decouple the continued routing of a message from the current thread?

image::eip/MessagingAdapterIcon.gif[image]

Submit the message to a thread pool, which then is responsible for the continued routing of the message.

In Camel, this is implemented as the Threads EIP.

== Using Threads EIP

The example below will add a Thread pool with a pool size of five threads before sending to `mock:result`.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .threads(5)
  .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="seda:a"/>
    <threads poolSize="5"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----
====

And to use a thread pool with a task queue of only 20 elements:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .threads(5).maxQueueSize(20)
  .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="seda:a"/>
    <threads poolSize="5" maxQueueSize="20"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----
====

And you can also use a thread pool with no queue (meaning that a task cannot be pending on a queue):

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .threads(5).maxQueueSize(0)
  .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="seda:a"/>
    <threads poolSize="5" maxQueueSize="0"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>

=== About rejected tasks

The Threads EIP uses a thread pool which has a worker queue for tasks.
When the worker queue gets full, the task is rejected.

You can customize how to react upon this using the `rejectedPolicy` and
`callerRunsWhenRejected` options. The latter is used to easily switch
between the two most common and recommended settings. Either let the
current caller thread execute the task (i.e. it will become synchronous),
but also give time for the thread pool to process its current tasks,
without adding more tasks (self throttling). This is the default
behavior.

The `Abort` policy, means the task is rejected, and a
`RejectedExecutionException` is thrown.

IMPORTANT: The reject policy options `Discard` and `DiscardOldest` is deprecated in Camel 3.x and removed in Camel 4 onwards.

=== Default values

The Threads EIP uses the default values from the default xref:manual:ROOT:threading-model.adoc[Thread Pool Profile].
If the profile has not been altered, then the default profile is as follows:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
| Option | Default | Description
| *poolSize* | `10` | Sets the default core pool size (minimum number of threads to keep in pool)
| *keepAliveTime* | `60` | Sets the default keep-alive time (in seconds) for inactive threads
| *maxPoolSize* | `20` | Sets the default maximum pool size
| *maxQueueSize* | `1000` | Sets the default maximum number of tasks in the work queue. Use -1 for an unbounded queue.
| *allowCoreThreadTimeOut* | `true` | Sets default whether to allow core threads to timeout
| *rejectedPolicy* | `CallerRuns` | Sets the default handler for tasks which cannot be executed by the thread pool. Has four options:
`Abort, CallerRuns, Discard, DiscardOldest` which corresponds to the same four options provided out of the box in the JDK.
