== Samples

The example below will add a Thread pool with a pool size of 5 threads before sending to *mock:result*.

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .threads(5)
  .to("mock:result");
----

=== Spring DSL

The sample below demonstrates the threads EIP in Spring DSL:

<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="seda:a"/>
        <threads poolSize="5"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
