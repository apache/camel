== About rejected tasks

The Threads EIP uses a thread pool which has a worker queue for tasks.
When the worker queue gets full, the task is rejected. You can customize
how to react upon this using the `rejectedPolicy` and
`callerRunsWhenRejected` option. The latter is used to easily switch
between the two most common and recommended settings. Either let the
current caller thread execute the task (i.e. it will become synchronous),
but also give time for the thread pool to process its current tasks,
without adding more tasks (self throttling). This is the default
behavior. If setting `callerRunsWhenRejected` you use the `Abort`
policy, which means the task is rejected, and a
`RejectedExecutionException` is set on the xref:manual:ROOT:exchange.adoc[Exchange],
and the `Exchange` will stop continue being routed, and its `UnitOfWork` will be regarded as failed.

The other options `Discard` and `DiscardOldest` work a bit like
`Abort`, however they do *not* set any exception on the
Exchange, which means the `Exchange` will *not* be regarded as failed, but the
`Exchange` will be successful. When using `Discard` and `DiscardOldest` then the `Exchange` will not
continue being routed.

== Example

The example below will add a Thread pool with a pool size of 5 threads before sending to *mock:result*.

[source,java]
----
from("seda:a")
  .threads(5)
  .to("mock:result");
----

And in XML DSL

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="seda:a"/>
    <threads poolSize="5"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----
