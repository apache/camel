A sampling throttler allows you to extract a sample of the exchanges from the traffic through a route.

The Sample EIP selects a single message in a given time period or every nth message.
This selected message is allowed to pass through, and all other messages are stopped.

== Options

// eip options: END

== Exchange properties

// eip exchangeProperties: END


== Using Sample EIP

In the example below, we sample one message per second (default time period):

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:sample")
    .sample()
    .to("direct:sampled");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:sample"/>
    <sample/>
    <to uri="direct:sampled"/>
</route>
----
====

=== Sampling using time period

The default time period is 1 second, but this can easily be configured.
For example, to sample one message per 5 seconds, you can do:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:sample")
    .sample(Duration.of(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
    .to("direct:sampled");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:sample"/>
    <sample samplePeriod="5000"/>
    <to uri="direct:sampled"/>
</route>
----
====

=== Sampling using message frequency

The Sample EIP can also be configured to sample based on frequency instead of a time period.

For example, to sample every 10th message you can do:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:sample")
    .sample(10)
    .to("direct:sampled");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:sample"/>
    <sample messageFrequency="10"/>
    <to uri="direct:sampled"/>
</route>
----
====

=== Sampling with wiretap

The sampling throttler will stop all exchanges not included in the sample. This may be undesirable if you want to
perform custom processing on the sample while still allowing all 10 messages to flow to an endpoint after the sample EIP.

For this use case, you can combine the sample EIP with wiretap EIP. In the example below, we sample every 10th message
and send it to direct:sampleProcessing, while all 10 messages are still sent to direct:regularProcessing.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .wireTap("direct:sample")
  .to("direct:regularProcessing")

from("direct:sample")
  .sample(10)
  .to("direct:sampleProcessing");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <wireTap uri="direct:sample"/>
    <to uri="direct:regularProcessing"/>
</route>

<route>
    <from uri="direct:sample"/>
    <sample messageFrequency="10"/>
    <to uri="direct:sampleProcessing"/>
</route>
