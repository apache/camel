The Bean EIP is used for invoking a method on a bean, and the returned value
is the new message body.

The Bean EIP is similar to the xref:ROOT:bean-component.adoc[Bean] component
which also is used for invoking beans, but in the form as a Camel component.

== URI Format

[source]
----
bean:beanID[?options]
----

Where *beanID* can be any string which is used to look up the bean in
the xref:manual::registry.adoc[Registry].

== EIP options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

=== Bean scope

When using `singleton` scope (default) the bean is created or looked up only once and reused for the lifetime of the endpoint.
The bean should be thread-safe in case concurrent threads is calling the bean at the same time.

When using `request` scope the bean is created or looked up once per request (exchange). This can be used if you want to store state on a bean
while processing a request, and you want to call the same bean instance multiple times while processing the request.
The bean does not have to be thread-safe as the instance is only called from the same request.

When using `prototype` scope, then the bean will be looked up or created per call. However, in case of lookup then this is delegated
to the bean registry such as Spring or CDI (if in use), which depends on their configuration can act as either singleton or prototype scope.
However, when using `prototype` then behaviour is dependent on the delegated registry (such as Spring, Quarkus or CDI).

== Example

The Bean EIP can be used directly in the routes as shown below:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
// lookup bean from registry and invoke the given method by the name
from("direct:foo").bean("myBean", "myMethod");

// lookup bean from registry and invoke best matching method
from("direct:bar").bean("myBean");
----

XML:: With Spring XML you can declare the bean using `<bean>` as shown:
+
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myBean" class="com.foo.ExampleBean"/>
----
+
And in XML DSL you can call this bean:
+
[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route>
      <from uri="direct:foo"/>
      <bean ref="myBean" method="myMethod"/>
    </route>
    <route>
      <from uri="direct:bar"/>
      <bean ref="myBean"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: direct:start
    steps:
      - bean:
          ref: myBean
          method: myMethod
- from:
    uri: direct:start
    steps:
      - bean:
          ref: myBean
- beans:
    - name: myBean
      type: com.foo.ExampleBean
----
====

Instead of passing name of the reference to the bean (so that Camel will
lookup for it in the registry), you can provide the bean:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
// Send message to the given bean instance.
from("direct:foo").bean(new ExampleBean());

// Explicit selection of bean method to be invoked.
from("direct:bar").bean(new ExampleBean(), "myMethod");

// Camel will create a singleton instance of the bean, and reuse the instance for following calls (see scope)
from("direct:cheese").bean(ExampleBean.class);
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route>
      <from uri="direct:foo"/>
      <bean beanType="com.foo.ExampleBean" method="myMethod"/>
    </route>
    <route>
      <from uri="direct:bar"/>
      <bean beanType="com.foo.ExampleBean"/>
    </route>
    <route>
      <from uri="direct:cheese"/>
      <bean beanType="com.foo.ExampleBean"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: direct:foo
    steps:
      - bean:
          beanType: com.foo.ExampleBean
          method: myMethod
- from:
    uri: direct:bar
    steps:
      - bean:
          beanType: com.foo.ExampleBean
- from:
    uri: direct:cheese
    steps:
      - bean:
          beanType: com.foo.ExampleBean

== Bean binding

How bean methods to be invoked are chosen (if they are not specified
explicitly through the *method* parameter) and how parameter values are
constructed from the xref:message.adoc[Message] are all defined by the
xref:manual::bean-binding.adoc[Bean Binding] mechanism which is used throughout
all the various xref:manual::bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration]
mechanisms in Camel.
