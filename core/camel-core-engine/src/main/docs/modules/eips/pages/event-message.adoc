= Event Message
:tabs-sync-option:

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/EventMessage.html[Event Message]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How can messaging be used to transmit events from one application to another?

image::eip/EventMessageSolution.gif[image]

Use an Event Message for reliable, asynchronous event notification between applications.

Camel supports Event Message by the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
on a xref:message.adoc[Message] which can be set to `InOnly` to indicate
a oneway event message. Camel xref:ROOT:index.adoc[Components] then
implement this pattern using the underlying transport or protocols.

The default behaviour of many xref:ROOT:index.adoc[Components] is `InOnly`
such as for xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS], xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[File] or
xref:ROOT:seda-component.adoc[SEDA].

Some components support both `InOnly` and `InOut` and act accordingly.
For example, the xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS]
can send messages as one-way (`InOnly`) or use request/reply messaging (`InOut`).

TIP: See the related xref:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request Reply] message.

== Using endpoint URI

If you are using a component which defaults to `InOut` you can override
the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern] for a *consumer* endpoint using
the pattern property.

[source,text]
----
foo:bar?exchangePattern=InOnly
----

IMPORTANT: This is only possible on endpoints used by consumers (i.e., in `<from>`).

In the example below the message will be forced as an event message as the consumer
is in `InOnly` mode.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("mq:someQueue?exchangePattern=InOnly")
  .to("activemq:queue:one-way");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="mq:someQueue?exchangePattern=InOnly"/>
    <to uri="activemq:queue:one-way"/>
</route>
----

== Using `setExchangePattern` EIP

You can specify the
xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern] using `setExchangePattern` in the DSL.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("mq:someQueue")
  .setExchangePattern(ExchangePattern.InOnly)
  .to("activemq:queue:one-way");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="mq:someQueue"/>
    <setExchangePattern pattern="InOnly"/>
    <to uri="activemq:queue:one-way"/>
</route>
----
====

When using `setExchangePattern` then the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
on the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] is changed from this point onwards in the route.

This means you can change the pattern back again at a later point:

[source,java]
----
from("mq:someQueue")
  .setExchangePattern(ExchangePattern.InOnly)
  .to("activemq:queue:one-way");
  .setExchangePattern(ExchangePattern.InOut)
  .to("activemq:queue:in-and-out")
  .log("InOut MEP received ${body}")
----

NOTE: Using `setExchangePattern` to change the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
is often only used in special use-cases where you must
force to be using either `InOnly` or `InOut` mode when using components that support both modes (such as messaging components like ActiveMQ, JMS, RabbitMQ etc.)

== JMS component and InOnly vs. InOut

When consuming messages from xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] a Request Reply is
indicated by the presence of the `JMSReplyTo` header. This means the JMS component automatic
detects whether to use `InOnly` or `InOut` in the consumer.

Likewise, the JMS producer will check the current xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
on the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] to know whether to use `InOnly` or `InOut` mode (i.e., one-way vs. request/reply messaging)


== Other Implementation Details

There are concrete classes that implement the `Message` interface for each Camel-supported communications technology. For example, the `JmsMessage` class provides a JMS-specific implementation of the `Message` interface. The public API of the `Message` interface provides getters and setters methods to access the _message id_, _body_ and individual _header_ fields of a message.
