= Message Bus

Camel supports the
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageBus.html[Message
Bus] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].
You could view Camel as a Message Bus itself as it allows producers and
consumers to be decoupled.

A messaging system such as Apache ActiveMQ can be used as Message Bus.

== Example

The following demonstrates how the Camel message bus can be used to
ingest message into the bus with the xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] component.

[source,java]
----
from("file:inbox")
    .to("jms:inbox");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="file:inbox"/>
    <to uri="jms:inbox"/>
</route>
----
