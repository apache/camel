== Example

We want to load balance between three endpoints in round-robin mode.

This is done as follows in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance().roundRobin()
        .to("seda:x")
        .to("seda:y")
        .to("seda:z")
    .end();
----

In XML, you'll have a route like this:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <loadBalance>
       <roundRobinLoadBalancer/>
       <to uri="seda:x"/>
       <to uri="seda:y"/>
       <to uri="seda:z"/>
    </loadBalance>
</route>
----
