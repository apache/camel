:description: Route messages based on a series of predicates
:since:
:supportlevel: Stable

The Switch EIP is an optimized http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ContentBasedRouter.html[Content
Based Router] which selects a single branch (when/otherwise) during startup, and
always executes the same branch. This allows to optimize the runtime Camel to avoid
this evaluation process for every message; because they are supposed
to always be routed on the same branch.

NOTE: Because the Switch EIP evaluates the predicates during startup, then the predicates
cannot be based on the content of the message. Therefore, the predicates would often
be based on property placeholders, JVM system properties, or OS Environment variables.

The Switch EIP combined with xref:manual:ROOT:route-template.adoc[Route Templates] allows
for more flexible templates, as the template parameters can be used as the predicates in the Switch EIP;
meaning that the Switch EIP is fully parameterized, but is optimized for best runtime performance.

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Example

The Camel xref:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language
is great to use with the Switch EIP to select a specific branch based
on xref:manual:ROOT:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders].

Here we select from the Switch the first predicate that matches. So if there is
a property placeholder with the key `foo` then its select, and so on.
Notice how we can use `{{?foo}}` to mark the property placeholder as optional.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .doSwitch()
        .when(simple("{{?foo}}")).to("direct:foo")
        .when(simple("{{?bar}}")).to("direct:bar")
        .otherwise().to("direct:other");
----

And the same example using XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <doSwitch>
        <when>
            <simple>{{?foo}}</simple>
            <to uri="direct:foo"/>
        </when>
        <when>
            <simple>{{?bar}}</simple>
            <to uri="direct:bar"/>
        </when>
        <otherwise>
            <to uri="direct:other"/>
        </otherwise>
    </doSwitch>
</route>
----

And in YAML DS:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "direct:a"
    steps:
      - doSwitch:
          when:
            - simple: "{{?foo}}"
              steps:
                - to: "direct:foo"
            - simple: "{{?bar}}"
              steps:
                - to: "direct:bar"
          otherwise:
            steps:
              - to: "direct:other"
----

TIP: Otherwise, is optional, and if none of the predicates would match, then no branches is selected.
