:description: In case of failures the exchange will be tried on the next endpoint.
:since:

:tabs-sync-option:

This EIP allows using fail-over (in case of failures, the exchange will be tried on the next endpoint)
with the xref:loadBalance-eip.adoc[Load Balancer] EIP.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Example

In the example below, calling the three http services is done with the load balancer:

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance().failover()
        .to("http:service1")
        .to("http:service2")
        .to("http:service3")
    .end();
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <loadBalance>
        <failover/>
        <to uri="http:service1"/>
        <to uri="http:service2"/>
        <to uri="http:service3"/>
    </loadBalance>
</route>
----

====

In the default mode, the fail-over load balancer will always start with the first processor (i.e., "http:service1").
And in case this fails, then try the next, until either it succeeded or all of them failed.
If all failed, then Camel will throw the caused exception which means the Exchange is failed.

=== Using round-robin mode

You can use the `roundRobin` mode to start again from the beginning, which then will keep
trying until one succeed. To prevent endless retries, then it's recommended to
set a maximum fail-over value.

Setting this in Java DSL is not _pretty_ as there are three parameters:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance().failover(10, false, true)
        .to("http:service1")
        .to("http:service2")
        .to("http:service3")
    .end();
----

[source,java]
----
.failover(10, false, true)
----

Where `10` is the maximum fail over attempts, And `false` is a special feature
related to inheriting error handler.
The last parameter `true` is to use round-robin mode.

In XML, it is straightforward as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <loadBalance>
        <failover roundRobin="true" maximumFailoverAttempts="10"/>
        <to uri="http:service1"/>
        <to uri="http:service2"/>
        <to uri="http:service3"/>
    </loadBalance>
</route>
----

=== Using sticky mode

The sticky mode is used for remember the last known good endpoint, so the next exchange
will start from there, instead from the beginning.

For example, support that http:service1 is down, and that service2 is up.
With sticky mode enabled, then Camel will keep starting from service2 until it
fails, and then try service3.

If sticky mode is not enabled (it's disabled by default), then Camel will always start from the beginning, which
means calling service1.

Java::

Setting sticky mode in Java DSL is not _pretty_ as there are four parameters.
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance().failover(10, false, true, true)
        .to("http:service1")
        .to("http:service2")
        .to("http:service3")
    .end();
----
+
NOTE: The last `true` argument is to enable sticky mode.

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <loadBalance>
        <failover roundRobin="true" maximumFailoverAttempts="10" stickyMode="true"/>
        <to uri="http:service1"/>
        <to uri="http:service2"/>
        <to uri="http:service3"/>
    </loadBalance>
</route>

=== Fail-over on specific exceptions

The fail-over load balancer can be configured to only apply for a specific set of exceptions.
Suppose you only want to fail-over in case of `java.io.Exception` or `HttpOperationFailedException` then you can do:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .loadBalance().failover(IOException.class, HttpOperationFailedException.class)
        .to("http:service1")
        .to("http:service2")
        .to("http:service3")
    .end();
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <loadBalance>
        <failover>
            <exception>java.io.IOException</exception>
            <exception>org.apache.camel.http.base.HttpOperationFailedException</exception>
        </failover>
        <to uri="http:service1"/>
        <to uri="http:service2"/>
        <to uri="http:service3"/>
    </loadBalance>
</route>
