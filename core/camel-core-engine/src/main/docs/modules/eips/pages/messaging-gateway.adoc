Camel supports the

from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] book.

How do you encapsulate access to the messaging system from the rest of the application?

Use a Messaging Gateway, a class than wraps messaging-specific method calls and exposes domain-specific methods to the application.

Camel has several endpoint components that support the Messaging Gateway from the EIP patterns.
Components like xref:components::bean-component.adoc[Bean] and xref:components::bean-component.adoc[CXF] provide a a way
to bind a Java interface to the message exchange.

Another approach is to use `@Produce` annotations which you can read about in xref:latest@manual:ROOT:pojo-producing.adoc[POJO Producing]
which also can be used as a Messaging Gateway EIP solution.
