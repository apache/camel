= Messaging Gateway

Camel supports the

from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] book.

How do you encapsulate access to the messaging system from the rest of the application?

Use a Messaging Gateway, a class than wraps messaging-specific method calls and exposes domain-specific methods to the application.

Camel has several endpoint components that support the Messaging Gateway from the EIP patterns.
Components like xref:ROOT:bean-component.adoc[Bean] provides a way to bind a Java interface to the message exchange.

Another approach is to use `@Produce` annotations (xref:manual::pojo-producing.adoc[POJO Producing])
which also can be used to hide Camel APIs and thereby encapsulate access, acting as a Messaging Gateway EIP solution.
