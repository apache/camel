= Request Reply
:tabs-sync-option:

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/RequestReply.html[Request Reply]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

When an application sends a message, how can it get a response from the receiver?

image::eip/RequestReply.gif[image]

Send a pair of Request-Reply messages, each on its own channel.

Camel supports Request Reply by the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
on a xref:message.adoc[Message] which can be set to `InOut` to indicate a
request/reply message. Camel xref:ROOT:index.adoc[Components] then
implement this pattern using the underlying transport or protocols.

For example when using xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] with `InOut` the component will
by default perform these actions:

* create by default a temporary inbound queue
* set the `JMSReplyTo` destination on the request message
* set the `JMSCorrelationID` on the request message
* send the request message
* consume the response and associate the inbound message to the belonging request
using the `JMSCorrelationID` (as you may be performing many concurrent request/responses).
* continue routing when the reply is received and populated on the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange]

TIP: See the related xref:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Message].

== Using endpoint URI

If you are using a component which defaults to `InOnly` you can override
the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern] for a *consumer* endpoint using
the pattern property.

[source,text]
----
foo:bar?exchangePattern=InOut
----

IMPORTANT: This is only possible on endpoints used by consumers (i.e. in `<from>`).

In the example below the message will be forced as a request reply message as the consumer
is in `InOut` mode.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("jms:someQueue?exchangePattern=InOut")
  .to("bean:processMessage");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="jms:someQueue?exchangePattern=InOut"/>
    <to uri="bean:processMessage"/>
</route>
----

== Using setExchangePattern EIP

You can specify the
xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern] using `setExchangePattern` in the DSL.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:foo")
  .setExchangePattern(ExchangePattern.InOut)
  .to("jms:queue:cheese");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:foo"/>
    <setExchangePattern pattern="InOut"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:cheese"/>
</route>
----
====

When using `setExchangePattern` then the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
on the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] is changed from this point onwards in the route.

This means you can change the pattern back again at a later point:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:foo")
  .setExchangePattern(ExchangePattern.InOnly)
  .to("jms:queue:one-way");
  .setExchangePattern(ExchangePattern.InOut)
  .to("jms:queue:in-and-out")
  .log("InOut MEP received ${body}")
----

NOTE: Using `setExchangePattern` to change the xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
is often only used in special use-cases where you must
force to be using either `InOnly` or `InOut` mode when using components that support both modes (such as messaging components like ActiveMQ, JMS, RabbitMQ etc.)

== JMS component and InOnly vs InOut

When consuming messages from xref:ROOT:jms-component.adoc[JMS] a Request Reply is
indicated by the presence of the `JMSReplyTo` header. This means the JMS component automatic
detects whether to use `InOnly` or `InOut` in the consumer.

Likewise, the JMS producer will check the current xref:manual::exchange-pattern.adoc[Exchange Pattern]
on the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] to know whether to use `InOnly` or `InOut` mode (i.e. one-way vs request/reply messaging)
