The Multicast EIP allows routing *the same* message to a number of xref:manual::endpoint.adoc[endpoints]
and process them in a different way.

The Multicast EIP has many features and is also used as a baseline for
the xref:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List] and xref:split-eip.adoc[Split] EIPs.
For example, the Multicast EIP is capable of aggregating each multicasted message into a single
_response_ message as the result after the Multicast EIP.

== Using Multicast

The following example shows how to take a request from the `direct:a`
endpoint, then multicast these requests to `direct:x`, `direct:y`, and `direct:z`.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
  .multicast()
    .to("direct:x")
    .to("direct:y")
    .to("direct:z");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <multicast>
        <to uri="direct:b"/>
        <to uri="direct:c"/>
        <to uri="direct:d"/>
    </multicast>
</route>
----
====

By default, Multicast EIP runs in single threaded mode, which means
that the next multicasted message is processed only when the previous is finished.
This means that `direct:b` must be done before Camel will call `direct:c` and so on.

=== Multicasting with parallel processing

You can enable parallel processing with Multicast EIP so each multicasted message
is processed by its own thread in parallel.

The example below enabled parallel mode:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
  .multicast().parallelProcessing()
    .to("direct:x")
    .to("direct:y")
    .to("direct:z");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <multicast parallelProcessing="true">
        <to uri="direct:b"/>
        <to uri="direct:c"/>
        <to uri="direct:d"/>
    </multicast>
</route>
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When parallel processing is enabled, then the Camel routing engin will continue processing
using last used thread from the parallel thread pool. However, if you want to use the original
thread that called the multicast, then make sure to enable the synchronous option as well.
====

=== Ending a Multicast block

You may want to continue routing the exchange after the Multicast EIP. 

In the example below, then sending to `mock:result` happens after the Multicast EIP has finished.
In other words, `direct:x`, `direct:y`, and `direct:z` should be completed first, before the message
continues.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
  .multicast().parallelProcessing()
    .to("direct:x")
    .to("direct:y")
    .to("direct:z")
  .end()
  .to("mock:result");
----
+
Note that you need to use `end()` to mark where multicast ends, and where other 
EIPs can be added to continue the route.

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <multicast parallelProcessing="true">
        <to uri="direct:b"/>
        <to uri="direct:c"/>
        <to uri="direct:d"/>
    </multicast>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----
====

=== Aggregating

The `AggregationStrategy` is used for aggregating all the multicasted exchanges together
as a single response exchange, that becomes the outgoing exchange after the Multicast EIP block.

The example now aggregates with the `MyAggregationStrategy` class:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .multicast(new MyAggregationStrategy()).parallelProcessing().timeout(500)
    .to("direct:x")
    .to("direct:y")
    .to("direct:z")
  .end()
  .to("mock:result");
----

XML::
+
We can refer to the FQN class name with `#class:` syntax as shown below:
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:a"/>
    <multicast parallelProcessing="true" timeout="5000"
               aggreationStrategy="#class:com.foo.MyAggregationStrategy">
        <to uri="direct:b"/>
        <to uri="direct:c"/>
        <to uri="direct:d"/>
    </multicast>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The Multicast, Recipient List, and Splitter EIPs have special support for using `AggregationStrategy` with
access to the original input exchange. You may want to use this when you aggregate messages and
there has been a failure in one of the messages, which you then want to enrich on the original
input message and return as response; it's the aggregate method with three exchange parameters.
====

=== Stop processing in case of exception

The Multicast EIP will by default continue to process
the entire exchange even in case one of the
multicasted messages will throw an exception during routing. 

For example, if you want to multicast to three destinations and the second
destination fails by an exception. What Camel does by default is to
process the remainder destinations. You have the chance to deal with the exception
when aggregating using an `AggregationStrategy`.

But sometimes you want Camel to stop and let the exception be
propagated back, and let the Camel xref:manual::error-handler.adoc[Error Handler]
handle it. You can do this by specifying that it should stop in case of an
exception occurred. This is done by the `stopOnException` option as
shown below:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .multicast()
        .stopOnException().to("direct:foo", "direct:bar", "direct:baz")
    .end()
    .to("mock:result");

    from("direct:foo").to("mock:foo");

    from("direct:bar").process(new MyProcessor()).to("mock:bar");

    from("direct:baz").to("mock:baz");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <multicast stopOnException="true">
            <to uri="direct:foo"/>
            <to uri="direct:bar"/>
            <to uri="direct:baz"/>
        </multicast>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:foo"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:bar"/>
        <process ref="myProcessor"/>
        <to uri="mock:bar"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:baz"/>
        <to uri="mock:baz"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----
====

In the example above, then `MyProcessor` is causing a failure and throws an exception.
This means the Multicast EIP will stop after this, and not the last route (`direct:baz`).

=== Preparing the message by deep copying before multicasting

The multicast EIP will copy the source
exchange and multicast each copy. However, the copy
is a shallow copy, so in case you have mutable message bodies, then
any changes will be visible by the other copied messages. If you want to
use a deep clone copy, then you need to use a custom `onPrepare` which
allows you to create a deep copy of the message body in the `Processor`.

Notice the `onPrepare` can be used for any kind of custom logic that
you would like to execute before the xref:manual::exchange.adoc[Exchange] is
being multicasted.

== See Also

Because Multicast EIP is a baseline for
the xref:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List] and xref:split-eip.adoc[Split] EIPs,
then you can find more information in those EIPs about features that are also available
with Multicast EIP.
