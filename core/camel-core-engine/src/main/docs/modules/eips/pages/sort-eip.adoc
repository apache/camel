How can you sort the content of the message?

image::eip/MessageTranslator.gif[image]

Use a special filter, a xref:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator], between other filters to sort the content of the message.

== Options

// eip options: START
include::partial$eip-options.adoc[]
// eip options: END

== Exchange properties

// eip exchangeProperties: START
include::partial$eip-exchangeProperties.adoc[]
// eip exchangeProperties: END


== How sorting works

Sort will by default sort the message body using a default `Comparator` that handles numeric values
or uses the `String` representation.

You can also configure a custom `Comparator` to control the sorting.

An xref:manual::expression.adoc[Expression] can also be used, which performs the sorting, and returns the sorted message body.
The value returned from the `Expression` must be convertible to `java.util.List` as this is required by the JDK sort operation.

=== Using Sort EIP

Imagine you consume text files and before processing each file, you want to be sure the content is sorted.

In the route below, it will read the file content and tokenize by line breaks so each line can be sorted.

[source,java]
----
from("file:inbox")
    .sort(body().tokenize("\n"))
    .to("bean:MyServiceBean.processLine");
----

You can pass in your own comparator as a second argument:

[source,java]
----
from("file:inbox")
    .sort(body().tokenize("\n"), new MyReverseComparator())
    .to("bean:MyServiceBean.processLine");
----

In the route below, it will read the file content and tokenize by line breaks so each line can be sorted.
In XML, you use the xref:components:languages:tokenize-language.adoc[Tokenize] language as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file:inbox"/>
  <sort>
    <tokenize>\n</tokenize>
  </sort>
  <to uri="bean:myServiceBean.processLine"/>
</route>
----

And to use our own `Comparator` we do as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file:inbox"/>
  <sort comparator="#class:com.mycompany.MyReverseComparator">
    <simple>${body}</simple>
  </sort>
  <beanRef ref="MyServiceBean" method="processLine"/>
</route>
----

Notice how we use `<simple>$\{body}</simple>` in the example above to tell Sort EIP that it should use the message body for sorting.
This is needed when you use a custom `Comparator`.
