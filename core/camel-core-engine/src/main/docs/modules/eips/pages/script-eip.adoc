The Script EIP is used for executing a coding script.

This is useful when you need to invoke some logic that are not in Java code such as JavaScript,
Groovy or any of the other Languages.

NOTE: The returned value from the script is discarded and not used. If the returned value should be set as the new message body, then use the xref:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator] EIP instead.

== Using Script EIP

The route below will read the file contents and call a groovy script

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("file:inbox")
  .script().groovy("some groovy code goes here")
  .to("bean:myServiceBean.processLine");
----

XML::
+
[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file:inbox"/>
  <script>
    <groovy>some groovy code goes here</groovy>
  </script>
  <to uri="bean:myServiceBean.processLine"/>
</route>
----

Mind that you can use _CDATA_ if the script uses `< >` etc:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file://inbox"/>
  <script>
    <groovy><![CDATA[ some groovy script here that can be multiple lines and whatnot ]]></groovy>
  </script>
  <to uri="bean:myServiceBean.processLine"/>
</route>

=== Scripting Context

The scripting context has access to the current `Exchange` and can essentially change the message or headers directly.

=== Using external script files

You can refer to external script files instead of inlining the script.
For example to load a groovy script from the classpath you need to prefix the value with `resource:` as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file:inbox"/>
  <script>
    <groovy>resource:classpath:com/foo/myscript.groovy</groovy>
  </script>
  <to uri="bean:myServiceBean.processLine"/>
</route>
----

You can also refer to the script from the file system with `file:` instead of `classpath:`
such as `file:/var/myscript.groovy`
