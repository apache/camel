/**
 * Default {@link org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy} which uses graceful shutdown.
 * <p/>
 * Graceful shutdown ensures that any inflight and pending messages will be taken into account and it will wait until
 * these exchanges has been completed.
 * <p/>
 * This strategy will perform graceful shutdown in two steps:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Graceful - By suspending/stopping consumers, and let any in-flight exchanges complete</li>
 * <li>Forced - After a given period of time, a timeout occurred and if there are still pending exchanges to complete,
 * then a more aggressive forced strategy is performed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The idea by the <tt>graceful</tt> shutdown strategy, is to stop taking in more new messages, and allow any existing
 * inflight messages to complete. Then when there is no more inflight messages then the routes can be fully shutdown.
 * This mean that if there is inflight messages then we will have to wait for these messages to complete. If they do not
 * complete after a period of time, then a timeout triggers. And then a more aggressive strategy takes over.
 * <p/>
 * The idea by the <tt>forced</tt> shutdown strategy, is to stop continue processing messages. And force routes and its
 * services to shutdown now. There is a risk when shutting down now, that some resources is not properly shutdown, which
 * can cause side effects. The timeout value is by default 45 seconds, but can be customized.
 * <p/>
 * As this strategy will politely wait until all exchanges has been completed it can potential wait for a long time, and
 * hence why a timeout value can be set. When the timeout triggers you can also specify whether the remainder consumers
 * should be shutdown now or ignore.
 * <p/>
 * Will by default use a timeout of 45 seconds by which it will shutdown now the remaining consumers. This ensures that
 * when shutting down Camel it at some point eventually will shutdown. This behavior can of course be configured using
 * the {@link #setTimeout(long)} and {@link #setShutdownNowOnTimeout(boolean)} methods.
 * <p/>
 * Routes will by default be shutdown in the reverse order of which they where started. You can customize this using the
 * {@link #setShutdownRoutesInReverseOrder(boolean)} method.
 * <p/>
 * After route consumers have been shutdown, then any {@link ShutdownPrepared} services on the routes is being prepared
 * for shutdown, by invoking {@link ShutdownPrepared#prepareShutdown(boolean,boolean)} which <tt>force=false</tt>.
 * <p/>
 * Then if a timeout occurred and the strategy has been configured with shutdown-now on timeout, then the strategy
 * performs a more aggressive forced shutdown, by forcing all consumers to shutdown and then invokes
 * {@link ShutdownPrepared#prepareShutdown(boolean,boolean)} with <tt>force=true</tt> on the services. This allows the
 * services to know they should force shutdown now.
 * <p/>
 * When timeout occurred and a forced shutdown is happening, then there may be threads/tasks which are still inflight
 * which may be rejected continued being routed. By default this can cause WARN and ERRORs to be logged. The option
 * {@link #setSuppressLoggingOnTimeout(boolean)} can be used to suppress these logs, so they are logged at TRACE level
 * instead.
 * <p/>
 * Also when a timeout occurred then information about the inflight exchanges is logged, if
 * {@link #isLogInflightExchangesOnTimeout()} is enabled (is by default). This allows end users to known where these
 * inflight exchanges currently are in the route(s), and how long time they have been inflight.
 * <p/>
 * This information can also be obtained from the {@link org.apache.camel.spi.InflightRepository} at all time during
 * runtime.
