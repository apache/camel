## RabbitMQ Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.12*

The *rabbitmq:* component allows you produce and consume messages from
http://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] instances. Using the RabbitMQ AMQP
client, this component offers a pure RabbitMQ approach over the generic
http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html[AMQP] component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-rabbitmq</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------
rabbitmq://hostname[:port]/exchangeName?[options]
-------------------------------------------------

Where *hostname* is the hostname of the running rabbitmq instance or
cluster. Port is optional and if not specified then defaults to the
RabbitMQ client default (5672). The exchange name determines which
exchange produced messages will sent to. In the case of consumers, the
exchange name determines which exchange the queue will bind to.

### Options


// component options: START
The RabbitMQ component has no options.
// component options: END





// endpoint options: START
The RabbitMQ endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

    rabbitmq:hostname:portNumber/exchangeName

with the following path and query parameters:

#### Path Parameters (3 parameters):

|=======================================================================
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| **hostname** | *Required* The hostname of the running rabbitmq instance or cluster. |  | String
| **portNumber** | *Required* Port number for the host with the running rabbitmq instance or cluster. Default value is 5672. | 5672 | int
| **exchangeName** | *Required* The exchange name determines which exchange produced messages will sent to. In the case of consumers the exchange name determines which exchange the queue will bind to. |  | String
|=======================================================================

#### Query Parameters (57 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]

| **skipQueueBind** (common) | If true the queue will not be bound to the exchange after declaring it | false | boolean

| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| **concurrentConsumers** (consumer) | Number of concurrent consumers when consuming from broker. (eg similar as to the same option for the JMS component). | 1 | int

PublisherAcknowledgement will also be activated in this case See also publisher acknowledgements - When will messages be confirmed | false | boolean
| **immediate** (producer) | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue consumer immediately. If this flag is set the server will return an undeliverable message with a Return method. If this flag is zero the server will queue the message but with no guarantee that it will ever be consumed. If the header is present rabbitmq.IMMEDIATE it will override this option. | false | boolean
| **mandatory** (producer) | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue. If this flag is set the server will return an unroutable message with a Return method.

### Custom connection factory

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="customConnectionFactory" class="com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory">
  <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
  <property name="port" value="5672"/>
  <property name="username" value="camel"/>
  <property name="password" value="bugsbunny"/>
</bean>
<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:rabbitMQEx2"/>
    <to uri="rabbitmq://localhost:5672/ex2?connectionFactory=#customConnectionFactory"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Headers

The following headers are set on exchanges when consuming messages.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Value

|`rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY` |The routing key that was used to receive the message, or the routing key
that will be used when producing a message

|`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` |The exchange the message was received from

|`rabbitmq.DELIVERY_TAG` |The rabbitmq delivery tag of the received message

|`rabbitmq.REQUEUE` |*Camel 2.14.2:* This is used by the consumer to control rejection of the
message. When the consumer is complete processing the exchange, and if
the exchange failed, then the consumer is going to reject the message
from the RabbitMQ broker. The value of this header controls this
behavior. If the value is false (by default) then the message is
discarded/dead-lettered. If the value is true, then the message is
re-queued. 
|=======================================================================

The following headers are used by the producer. If these are set on the
camel exchange then they will be set on the RabbitMQ message.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Value

|`rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY` |The routing key that will be used when sending the message

|`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` |The exchange the message was received from, or sent to

|`rabbitmq.CONTENT_TYPE` |The contentType to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.PRIORITY` |The priority header to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.CORRELATIONID` |The correlationId to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.MESSAGE_ID` |The message id to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.DELIVERY_MODE` |If the message should be persistent or not

|`rabbitmq.USERID` |The userId to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.CLUSTERID` |The clusterId to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.REPLY_TO` |The replyTo to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.CONTENT_ENCODING` |The contentEncoding to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.TYPE` |The type to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.EXPIRATION` |The expiration to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.TIMESTAMP` |The timestamp to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.APP_ID` |The appId to set on the RabbitMQ message
|=======================================================================

Headers are set by the consumer once the message is received. The
producer will also set the headers for downstream processors once the
exchange has taken place. Any headers set prior to production that the
producer sets will be overriden.

### Message Body

The component will use the camel exchange in body as the rabbit mq
message body. The camel exchange in object must be convertible to a byte
array. Otherwise the producer will throw an exception of unsupported
body type.

### Samples

To receive messages from a queue that is bound to an exchange A with the
routing key B,

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------
from("rabbitmq://localhost/A?routingKey=B")
-------------------------------------------

To receive messages from a queue with a single thread with auto
acknowledge disabled.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("rabbitmq://localhost/A?routingKey=B&threadPoolSize=1&autoAck=false")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To send messages to an exchange called C

[source,java]
-------------------------------
...to("rabbitmq://localhost/B")
-------------------------------

Declaring a headers exchange and queue

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("rabbitmq://localhost/ex?exchangeType=headers&queue=q&bindingArgs=#bindArgs")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and place corresponding Map<String, Object> with the id of "bindArgs" in the Registry.

For example declaring a method in spring

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Bean(name="bindArgs")
public Map<String, Object> bindArgsBuilder() {
    return Collections.singletonMap("foo", "bar");
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
