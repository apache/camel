== RabbitMQ Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.12*

The *rabbitmq:* component allows you produce and consume messages from
http://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] instances. Using the RabbitMQ AMQP
client, this component offers a pure RabbitMQ approach over the generic
http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html[AMQP] component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-rabbitmq</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

=== URI format

The old syntax is *deprecated*:
[source,text]
----
rabbitmq://hostname[:port]/exchangeName?[options]
----

Instead the hostname and port is configured on the component level, or
can be provided as uri query parameters instead.

The new syntax is:
[source,text]
----
rabbitmq:exchangeName?[options]
----

Where *hostname* is the hostname of the running rabbitmq instance or
cluster. Port is optional and if not specified then defaults to the
RabbitMQ client default (5672). The exchange name determines which
exchange produced messages will sent to. In the case of consumers, the
exchange name determines which exchange the queue will bind to.

=== Options

// component options: START
The RabbitMQ component supports 50 options, which are listed below.

See
http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/current-javadoc/com/rabbitmq/client/ConnectionFactory.html[http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/current-javadoc/com/rabbitmq/client/ConnectionFactory.html]
and the AMQP specification for more information on connection options.

=== Using connection factory

To connect to RabbitMQ you can setup a `ConnectionFactory` (same as with JMS) with the login details such as:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="rabbitConnectionFactory" class="com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory">
  <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
  <property name="port" value="5672"/>
  <property name="username" value="camel"/>
  <property name="password" value="bugsbunny"/>
</bean>

And then refer to the connection factory in the endpoint uri as shown below:

<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:rabbitMQEx2"/>
    <to uri="rabbitmq:ex2?connectionFactory=#rabbitConnectionFactory"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

From Camel 2.21 onwards the `ConnectionFactory` is auto-detected by default, so you can just do

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:rabbitMQEx2"/>
    <to uri="rabbitmq:ex2"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----


=== Message Headers

The following headers are set on exchanges when consuming messages.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Value

|`rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY` |The routing key that was used to receive the message, or the routing key
that will be used when producing a message

|`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` |The exchange the message was received from

|`rabbitmq.DELIVERY_TAG` |The rabbitmq delivery tag of the received message

|`rabbitmq.REDELIVERY_TAG` |Whether the message is a redelivered

|`rabbitmq.REQUEUE` |*Camel 2.14.2:* This is used by the consumer to control rejection of the
message. When the consumer is complete processing the exchange, and if
the exchange failed, then the consumer is going to reject the message
from the RabbitMQ broker. The value of this header controls this
behavior. If the value is false (by default) then the message is
discarded/dead-lettered. If the value is true, then the message is
re-queued. 
|===

The following headers are used by the producer. If these are set on the
camel exchange then they will be set on the RabbitMQ message.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|===
|Property |Value

|`rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY` |The routing key that will be used when sending the message

|`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` |The exchange the message was received from

|`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_OVERRIDE_NAME` | *Camel 2.21:* Used for force sending the message to this exchange instead of the endpoint configured name on the producer

|`rabbitmq.CONTENT_TYPE` |The contentType to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.PRIORITY` |The priority header to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.CORRELATIONID` |The correlationId to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.MESSAGE_ID` |The message id to set on the RabbitMQ message

|===

Headers are set by the consumer once the message is received. The
producer will also set the headers for downstream processors once the
exchange has taken place. Any headers set prior to production that the
producer sets will be overriden.

=== Message Body

The component will use the camel exchange in body as the rabbit mq
message body. The camel exchange in object must be convertible to a byte
array. Otherwise the producer will throw an exception of unsupported
body type.

=== Samples

To receive messages from a queue that is bound to an exchange A with the
routing key B,

[source,java]
----
from("rabbitmq:A?routingKey=B")
----

To receive messages from a queue with a single thread with auto
acknowledge disabled.

[source,java]
----
from("rabbitmq:A?routingKey=B&threadPoolSize=1&autoAck=false")
----

To send messages to an exchange called C

[source,java]
----
to("rabbitmq:C")
----

Declaring a headers exchange and queue

[source,java]
----
from("rabbitmq:ex?exchangeType=headers&queue=q&bindingArgs=#bindArgs")
----

and place corresponding `Map<String, Object>` with the id of "bindArgs" in the Registry.

For example declaring a method in spring

[source,java]
----
@Bean(name="bindArgs")
public Map<String, Object> bindArgsBuilder() {
    return Collections.singletonMap("foo", "bar");
}
----

==== Issue when routing between exchanges (in Camel 2.20.x or older)

If you for example want to route messages from one Rabbit exchange to another as shown
in the example below with foo -> bar:

[source,java]
----
from("rabbitmq:foo")
  .to("rabbitmq:bar")
----

Then beware that Camel will route the message to itself, eg foo -> foo. So why is that?
This is because the consumer that receives the message (eg from) provides the message header
`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` with the name of the exchange, eg `foo`. And when the Camel producer
is sending the message to `bar` then the header `rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` will override this
and instead send the message to `foo`.

To avoid this you need to either:

- Remove the header:

[source,java]
----
from("rabbitmq:foo")
  .removeHeader("rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME")
  .to("rabbitmq:bar")
----

- Or turn on `bridgeEndpoint` mode on the producer:

[source,java]
----
from("rabbitmq:foo")
  .to("rabbitmq:bar?bridgeEndpoint=true")
----

From Camel 2.21 onwards this has been improved so you can easily route between exchanges.
The header `rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` is not longer used by the producer to override the destination exchange.
Instead a new header `rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_OVERRIDE_NAME` can be used to send to a different exchange.
For example to send to cheese exchange you can do

[source,java]
----
from("rabbitmq:foo")
  .setHeader("rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_OVERRIDE_NAME", constant("cheese"))
  .to("rabbitmq:bar")
----
