## RabbitMQ Component

*Available as of Camel 2.12*

The *rabbitmq:* component allows you produce and consume messages from
http://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] instances. Using the RabbitMQ AMQP
client, this component offers a pure RabbitMQ approach over the generic
http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html[AMQP] component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-rabbitmq</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------
rabbitmq://hostname[:port]/exchangeName?[options]
-------------------------------------------------

Where *hostname* is the hostname of the running rabbitmq instance or
cluster. Port is optional and if not specified then defaults to the
RabbitMQ client default (5672). The exchange name determines which
exchange produced messages will sent to. In the case of consumers, the
exchange name determines which exchange the queue will bind to.

### Options


// component options: START
The RabbitMQ component has no options.
// component options: END





// endpoint options: START
The RabbitMQ component supports 56 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| hostname | common |  | String | *Required* The hostname of the running rabbitmq instance or cluster.
| portNumber | common | 5672 | int | *Required* Port number for the host with the running rabbitmq instance or cluster. Default value is 5672.
| exchangeName | common |  | String | *Required* The exchange name determines which exchange produced messages will sent to. In the case of consumers the exchange name determines which exchange the queue will bind to.
| autoDelete | common | true | boolean | If it is true the exchange will be deleted when it is no longer in use
| connectionTimeout | common | 60000 | int | Connection timeout
| deadLetterExchange | common |  | String | The name of the dead letter exchange
| deadLetterExchangeType | common | direct | String | The type of the dead letter exchange
| deadLetterQueue | common |  | String | The name of the dead letter queue
| deadLetterRoutingKey | common |  | String | The routing key for the dead letter exchange
| declare | common | true | boolean | If the option is true camel declare the exchange and queue name and bind them together. If the option is false camel won't declare the exchange and queue name on the server.
| durable | common | true | boolean | If we are declaring a durable exchange (the exchange will survive a server restart)
| exchangeType | common | direct | String | The exchange type such as direct or topic.
| exclusive | common | false | boolean | Exclusive queues may only be accessed by the current connection and are deleted when that connection closes.
| queue | common |  | String | The queue to receive messages from
| routingKey | common |  | String | The routing key to use when binding a consumer queue to the exchange. For producer routing keys you set the header rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY.
| skipExchangeDeclare | common | false | boolean | This can be used if we need to declare the queue but not the exchange
| skipQueueBind | common | false | boolean | If true the queue will not be bound to the exchange after declaring it
| skipQueueDeclare | common | false | boolean | If true the producer will not declare and bind a queue. This can be used for directing messages via an existing routing key.
| vhost | common | / | String | The vhost for the channel
| autoAck | consumer | true | boolean | If messages should be auto acknowledged
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| concurrentConsumers | consumer | 1 | int | Number of concurrent consumers when consuming from broker. (eg similar as to the same option for the JMS component).
| prefetchCount | consumer |  | int | The maximum number of messages that the server will deliver 0 if unlimited. You need to specify the option of prefetchSize prefetchCount prefetchGlobal at the same time
| prefetchEnabled | consumer | false | boolean | Enables the quality of service on the RabbitMQConsumer side. You need to specify the option of prefetchSize prefetchCount prefetchGlobal at the same time
| prefetchGlobal | consumer | false | boolean | If the settings should be applied to the entire channel rather than each consumer You need to specify the option of prefetchSize prefetchCount prefetchGlobal at the same time
| prefetchSize | consumer |  | int | The maximum amount of content (measured in octets) that the server will deliver 0 if unlimited. You need to specify the option of prefetchSize prefetchCount prefetchGlobal at the same time
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.
| threadPoolSize | consumer (advanced) | 10 | int | The consumer uses a Thread Pool Executor with a fixed number of threads. This setting allows you to set that number of threads.
| bridgeEndpoint | producer | false | boolean | If the bridgeEndpoint is true the producer will ignore the message header of rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME and rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY
| channelPoolMaxSize | producer | 10 | int | Get maximum number of opened channel in pool
| channelPoolMaxWait | producer | 1000 | long | Set the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a channel from the pool
| guaranteedDeliveries | producer | false | boolean | When true an exception will be thrown when the message cannot be delivered (basic.return) and the message is marked as mandatory. PublisherAcknowledgement will also be activated in this case See also publisher acknowledgements - When will messages be confirmed
| immediate | producer | false | boolean | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue consumer immediately. If this flag is set the server will return an undeliverable message with a Return method. If this flag is zero the server will queue the message but with no guarantee that it will ever be consumed. If the header is present rabbitmq.IMMEDIATE it will override this option.
| mandatory | producer | false | boolean | This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be routed to a queue. If this flag is set the server will return an unroutable message with a Return method. If this flag is zero the server silently drops the message. If the header is present rabbitmq.MANDATORY it will override this option.
| publisherAcknowledgements | producer | false | boolean | When true the message will be published with publisher acknowledgements turned on
| publisherAcknowledgementsTimeout | producer |  | long | The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for a basic.ack response from RabbitMQ server
| addresses | advanced |  | Address[] | If this option is set camel-rabbitmq will try to create connection based on the setting of option addresses. The addresses value is a string which looks like server1:12345 server2:12345
| automaticRecoveryEnabled | advanced |  | Boolean | Enables connection automatic recovery (uses connection implementation that performs automatic recovery when connection shutdown is not initiated by the application)
| clientProperties | advanced |  | Map | Connection client properties (client info used in negotiating with the server)
| connectionFactory | advanced |  | ConnectionFactory | To use a custom RabbitMQ connection factory. When this option is set all connection options (connectionTimeout requestedChannelMax...) set on URI are not used
| exchangeArgsConfigurer | advanced |  | ArgsConfigurer | Set the configurer for setting the exchange args in Channel.exchangeDeclare
| networkRecoveryInterval | advanced |  | Integer | Network recovery interval in milliseconds (interval used when recovering from network failure)
| queueArgsConfigurer | advanced |  | ArgsConfigurer | Set the configurer for setting the queue args in Channel.queueDeclare

### Custom connection factory

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="customConnectionFactory" class="com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory">
  <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
  <property name="port" value="5672"/>
  <property name="username" value="camel"/>
  <property name="password" value="bugsbunny"/>
</bean>
<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:rabbitMQEx2"/>
    <to uri="rabbitmq://localhost:5672/ex2?connectionFactory=#customConnectionFactory"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Headers

The following headers are set on exchanges when consuming messages.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Value

|`rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY` |The routing key that was used to receive the message, or the routing key
that will be used when producing a message

|`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` |The exchange the message was received from

|`rabbitmq.DELIVERY_TAG` |The rabbitmq delivery tag of the received message

|`rabbitmq.REQUEUE` |*Camel 2.14.2:* This is used by the consumer to control rejection of the
message. When the consumer is complete processing the exchange, and if
the exchange failed, then the consumer is going to reject the message
from the RabbitMQ broker. The value of this header controls this
behavior. If the value is false (by default) then the message is
discarded/dead-lettered. If the value is true, then the message is
re-queued. 
|=======================================================================

The following headers are used by the producer. If these are set on the
camel exchange then they will be set on the RabbitMQ message.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Value

|`rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY` |The routing key that will be used when sending the message

|`rabbitmq.EXCHANGE_NAME` |The exchange the message was received from, or sent to

|`rabbitmq.CONTENT_TYPE` |The contentType to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.PRIORITY` |The priority header to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.CORRELATIONID` |The correlationId to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.MESSAGE_ID` |The message id to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.DELIVERY_MODE` |If the message should be persistent or not

|`rabbitmq.USERID` |The userId to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.CLUSTERID` |The clusterId to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.REPLY_TO` |The replyTo to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.CONTENT_ENCODING` |The contentEncoding to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.TYPE` |The type to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.EXPIRATION` |The expiration to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.TIMESTAMP` |The timestamp to set on the RabbitMQ message

|`rabbitmq.APP_ID` |The appId to set on the RabbitMQ message
|=======================================================================

Headers are set by the consumer once the message is received. The
producer will also set the headers for downstream processors once the
exchange has taken place. Any headers set prior to production that the
producer sets will be overriden.

### Message Body

The component will use the camel exchange in body as the rabbit mq
message body. The camel exchange in object must be convertible to a byte
array. Otherwise the producer will throw an exception of unsupported
body type.

### Samples

To receive messages from a queue that is bound to an exchange A with the
routing key B,

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------
from("rabbitmq://localhost/A?routingKey=B")
-------------------------------------------

To receive messages from a queue with a single thread with auto
acknowledge disabled.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("rabbitmq://localhost/A?routingKey=B&threadPoolSize=1&autoAck=false")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To send messages to an exchange called C

[source,java]
-------------------------------
...to("rabbitmq://localhost/B")
-------------------------------
