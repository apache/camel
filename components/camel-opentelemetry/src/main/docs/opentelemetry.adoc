*Since Camel {since}*

The OpenTelemetry component is used for tracing and timing incoming and
outgoing Camel messages using https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry].

Events (spans) are captured for incoming and outgoing messages being sent
to/from Camel.

== Configuration

The configuration properties for the OpenTelemetry tracer are:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Default |Description
|`instrumentationName`| camel | A name uniquely identifying the instrumentation scope, such as the instrumentation library, package, or fully qualified class name. Must not be null.
|`excludePatterns` |  | Sets exclude pattern(s) that will disable tracing for Camel
messages that matches the pattern. The content is a Set<String> where the key is a pattern. The pattern
uses the rules from Intercept.
|`encoding` | `false` | Sets whether the header keys need to be encoded (connector specific) or not. The value is a boolean.
Dashes are required for instances to be encoded for JMS property keys.
|`traceProcessors` | `false` | Setting this to true will create new OpenTelemetry Spans for each Camel Processors.
Use the excludePattern property to filter out Processors
|=======================================================================


== Using Camel OpenTelemetry

Include the `camel-opentelemetry` component in your POM, along with any specific dependencies associated with the
chosen OpenTelemetry compliant Tracer.

To explicitly configure OpenTelemetry support, instantiate the `OpenTelemetryTracer` and initialize the camel
context. You can optionally specify a `Tracer`, or alternatively it can be implicitly discovered using the
`Registry`

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenTelemetryTracer otelTracer = new OpenTelemetryTracer();
// By default, it uses the DefaultTracer, but you can override it with a specific OpenTelemetry Tracer implementation.
otelTracer.setTracer(...);
// And then initialize the context
otelTracer.init(camelContext);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: You would still need OpenTelemetry to instrument your code, which can be done via a <<OpenTelemetry-JavaAgent,Java agent>>.

=== Using with standalone Camel

If you use `camel-main` as standalone Camel, then you can enable and use OpenTelemetry without Java code.

Add `camel-opentelemetry` component in your POM, and configure in `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
camel.opentelemetry.enabled = true
# you can configure the other options
# camel.opentelemetry.instrumentationName = myApp
----

NOTE: You would still need OpenTelemetry to instrument your code, which can be done via a <<OpenTelemetry-JavaAgent,Java agent>>.

== Spring Boot

When running on Spring Boot, add the `camel-opentelemetry-starter` dependency to get started.

There are several ways to configure instrumentation of your Camel application running on Spring Boot with OpenTelemetry.
The first and easiest one is by using the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/[OpenTelemetry Java agent].
The other one is through Spring Boot's Actuator. We'll cover both.

[[OpenTelemetry-JavaAgent]]
=== Java Agent

Download the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/[latest version].

This package includes the instrumentation agent as well as instrumentation for all supported libraries and all available data exporters.
The package provides a completely automatic, out-of-the-box experience.

Enable the instrumentation agent using the `-javaagent` flag to the JVM.

[source,bash]
----
java -javaagent:path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -jar myapp.jar
----

By default, the OpenTelemetry Java agent uses https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/exporters/otlp[OTLP exporter] configured to send data to https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md[OpenTelemetry collector] at `http://localhost:4318`.

Configuration parameters are passed as Java system properties (`-D` flags) or as environment variables. See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/agent-config.md[the configuration documentation] for the full list of configuration items. For example:

[source,bash]
----
java -javaagent:path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.service.name=your-service-name \
     -Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp \
     -jar myapp.jar
----

=== Spring Boot's Actuator

To have Spring Boot's Actuator configure OpenTelemetry, you need to add
`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator` and `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` to your project.
OpenTelemetry's `Tracer` will then be
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/tracing.html[configured] through `spring-boot-starter-actuator` unless a `Tracer` is already defined.

*Noteworthy*: by default, this will sample only 10% of requests to prevent overwhelming the trace backend.
Set the property `management.tracing.sampling.probability` to `1.0` if you want to see all traces.

=== SpanExporters

You'll probably want to configure at least one https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/sdk/#spanexporter[SpanExporter]
as they allow you to export your traces to various backends (e.g., Zipkin and Jaeger), or log them. For example, to export your traces to Jaeger using OTLP via gRPC,
add `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` as a dependency to your project. To configure it, you can
use the `management.otlp.tracing` properties or register a new `SpanExporter` bean yourself:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Bean
public SpanExporter OtlpGrpcSpanExporter(@Value("${tracing.url}") String url) {
    return OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder().setEndpoint(url).build();
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring Boot's Actuator will take care of the wiring for you.

Alternatively if you just want to log your traces in OTLP JSON format,
add `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-logging-otlp` as a dependency to your project and also register a new `SpanExporter` bean:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Bean
public SpanExporter logTraces() {
    return OtlpJsonLoggingSpanExporter.create();
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple `SpanExporters` can be used at the same time.


== MDC Logging

When MDC Logging is enabled for the active Camel context the Trace ID and Span ID will be added and removed from the MDC for each route, the keys are `trace_id` and `span_id`, respectively.
