*Since Camel {since}*

This module is the implementation of the common `camel-telemetry` interface based on https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer Application Observability] technology. The name used here as `Micrometer Observability 2` is done to distinguish on the existing `camel-observation` component which was based on an older Camel tracing and Micrometer Observability specification. You're invited to start replacing the older `camel-observation` with this one instead as it may become the default component in future version of Camel.

This component is significantly more difficult to setup than other telemetry components. This is because you will need to configure the tracing mechanism at a low level. If you're looking for a telemetry component to configure in a simpler fashion you may have a look at the others `camel-telemetry` implementations.

NOTE: this component has slight differences compared to the `camel-observation` and is meant to solve a few inconsistencies identified.

== Micrometer Application Observability framework

Mind that the framework is an abstraction layer, therefore it is expected that the integration developers configure the Registry and the Context Propagation mechanisms (more info in a dedicated chapter later) adding the concrete technology (Opentelemetry, Brave/Zipkin) of choice.

== Configuration

The configuration properties for the component are:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Default |Description
|`excludePatterns` |  | Sets exclude pattern(s) that will disable tracing for Camel
messages that matches the pattern. The content is a Set<String> where the key is a pattern. The pattern
uses the rules from Intercept.
|`traceProcessors` | `false` | Setting this to true will create new spans for each Camel Processors.
Use the excludePattern property to filter out Processors
|=======================================================================

=== Using with standalone Camel

If you use `camel-main` as standalone Camel, add `camel-micrometer-observability` component in your POM, and setup the proper configuration. Mind that, since the component is a facade to a concrete implementation, you are in charge to provide the configuration programmatically. The minimum required for the component to start is the following snippet of code:

```java
import org.apache.camel.micrometer.observability.MicrometerObservabilityTracer;
...
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        MicrometerObservabilityTracer myTracer = new MicrometerObservabilityTracer();
        getContext().getRegistry().bind("myTracer", myTracer);
        myTracer.init(getContext());
        ...
    }
```

You can run this, for example, directly via Camel JBang using `camel run MyTest.java --dep camel-micrometer-observability`. This basic configuration will start an "in-memory" simple implementation with a "no-op" context propagation. You may want to use this exclusively for development purposes. In order to configure it for a production environment you will need to setup a `Tracer`, an `ObservationRegistry` and a `Propagator`.

If you need to setup the specific component parameters, you may do it directly on the tracer object, for example:

```java
     myTracer.setTraceProcessors(true);
     myTracer.setExcludePatterns("log*,to*");
```

The production configuration vary based on the concrete technology you use (likely, `Opentelemetry` or `Brave/Zipkin`). What you need to do is to include the specific Maven dependency and to bind a concrete implementation for each of the following beans:

     * io.micrometer.tracing.Tracer
     * io.micrometer.observation.ObservationRegistry
     * io.micrometer.tracing.propagation.Propagator

=== Opentelemetry example

Here it follows an example to configure the component to work with Opentelemetry bridge. First of all, you need to include in your project the dependencies for `io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel` and `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk:x.y.z` (you need to explicitly set the version for the last dependency).

```java
import org.apache.camel.micrometer.observability.MicrometerObservabilityTracer;
import io.micrometer.tracing.otel.bridge.OtelCurrentTraceContext;
import io.micrometer.tracing.otel.bridge.OtelPropagator;
import io.micrometer.tracing.otel.bridge.OtelTracer;
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.OpenTelemetrySdk;
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.trace.SdkTracerProvider;
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export.SimpleSpanProcessor;
//import io.opentelemetry.exporter.zipkin.ZipkinSpanExporter;
import io.opentelemetry.context.propagation.ContextPropagators;
import io.opentelemetry.api.trace.propagation.W3CTraceContextPropagator;
...

        SdkTracerProvider sdkTracerProvider = SdkTracerProvider.builder()
            // inmemory implementation
            .addSpanProcessor(SimpleSpanProcessor.create(
                io.opentelemetry.sdk.testing.exporter.InMemorySpanExporter.create()))
            // or
            // .addSpanProcessor(
            //     BatchSpanProcessor.builder(
            //         ZipkinSpanExporter.builder()
            //             .setEndpoint("http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans")
            //             .build()
            //     ).build()
            // which requires a Zipkin server listening to that port
            // )
            .build();
        ContextPropagators propagators =  ContextPropagators.create(
                    W3CTraceContextPropagator.getInstance());
        OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
            .setTracerProvider(sdkTracerProvider)
            .setPropagators(propagators)
            .build();
        io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Tracer otelTracer =
            openTelemetry.getTracer("camel-app");
        io.micrometer.tracing.Tracer micrometerTracer = new OtelTracer(
                otelTracer,
                new OtelCurrentTraceContext(),
                null);
        OtelPropagator otelPropagator = new OtelPropagator(propagators, otelTracer);
        getContext().getRegistry().bind("MicrometerObservabilityTracer", micrometerTracer);
        getContext().getRegistry().bind("OpentelemetryPropagators", otelPropagator);
        MicrometerObservabilityTracer myTracer = new MicrometerObservabilityTracer();
        getContext().getRegistry().bind("myTracer", myTracer);
        myTracer.init(getContext());
        ...
```

NOTE: this is an example that can be used as a reference. It may not work exactly as it is, since, the related dependency can change from version to version. You will need to check in details looking at the concrete implementation documentation.

You can see that the configuration of this component may get a bit difficult, unless you are already familiar with the tracing technology you're going to implement.

=== How to trace

Once the application is instrumented and configured, you can observe the traces produced with the tooling compatible to the concrete implementation you have in place. You are invited to follow the specific documentation of each technology.

=== Java Agents

Your application may require a Java agent in order to get the traces generated by the Camel application and push to the tracing server (ie, Opentelemetry based instrumentation). You may need to configure such agent (or any other tool) directly via Java parameters.
