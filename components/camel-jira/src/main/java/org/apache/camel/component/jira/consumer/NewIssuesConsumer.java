/**
 * Consumes new JIRA issues.

 * To correctly support getting issues across multiple projects, the issues are ordered using created attribute, the
 * creation date is later used in the JQL to get only the new issues. JQL does not support timestamp or seconds and the
 * most useful format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm.
 * <p>
 * Using the date and time in JQL is a bit tricky the creationDate of an issue is returned in server timezone, but the
 * date and time in the JQL must match the timezone of the user executing the query to work properly.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: We manually add "ORDER BY created DESC" to the JQL in order to optimize startup (the latest issues one at a
 * time) and to correctly get the newest issue.
