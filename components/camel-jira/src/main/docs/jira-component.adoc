[[jira-component]]
== JIRA Component (deprecated)

*Available as of Camel version 2.15*


The JIRA component interacts with the JIRA API by encapsulating
Atlassian's https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.jira-rest-java-client[REST
Java Client for JIRA]. It currently provides polling for new issues and
new comments.  It is also able to create new issues.

Rather than webhooks, this endpoint relies on simple polling. Reasons
include:

* Concern for reliability/stability
* The types of payloads we're polling aren't typically large (plus,
paging is available in the API)
* The need to support apps running somewhere not publicly accessible
where a webhook would fail

Note that the JIRA API is fairly expansive.  Therefore, this component
could be easily expanded to provide additional interactions.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jira</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,text]
-------------------------
jira://endpoint[?options]
-------------------------

### JIRA Options


// component options: START
The JIRA component has no options.
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The JIRA endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
jira:type
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *type* | *Required* Operation to perform such as create a new issue or a new comment |  | JIRAType
|===


==== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *password* (common) | Password for login |  | String
| *serverUrl* (common) | *Required* URL to the JIRA server |  | String
| *username* (common) | Username for login |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *delay* (consumer) | Delay in seconds when querying JIRA using the consumer. | 6000 | int
| *jql* (consumer) | JQL is the query language from JIRA which allows you to retrieve the data you want. For example jql=project=MyProject Where MyProject is the product key in Jira. |  | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
=== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration


The component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.jira.enabled* | Enable jira component | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.jira.resolve-property-placeholders* | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | Boolean
|===
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: END




### JQL:

The JQL URI option is used by both consumer endpoints.  Theoretically,
items like "project key", etc. could be URI options themselves.
 However, by requiring the use of JQL, the consumers become much more
flexible and powerful.

At the bare minimum, the consumers will require the following:

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------------------
jira://[endpoint]?[required options]&jql=project=[project key]
--------------------------------------------------------------

One important thing to note is that the newIssue consumer will
automatically append "ORDER BY key desc" to your JQL.  This is in order
to optimize startup processing, rather than having to index every single
issue in the project.

Another note is that, similarly, the newComment consumer will have to
index every single issue *and* comment in the project.  Therefore, for
large projects, it's *vital* to optimize the JQL expression as much as
possible.  For example, the JIRA Toolkit Plugin includes a "Number of
comments" custom field -- use '"Number of comments" > 0' in your query.
Also try to minimize based on state (status=Open), increase the polling
delay, etc.  Example:

[source,text]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jira://[endpoint]?[required options]&jql=RAW(project=[project key] AND status in (Open, \"Coding In Progress\") AND \"Number of comments\">0)"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
