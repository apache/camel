= Spring Integration Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.4*

The Spring Integration component provides a bridge for Camel
components to talk to
http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration[spring integration
endpoints].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring-integration</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
spring-integration:defaultChannelName[?options]
-----------------------------------------------

Where *defaultChannelName* represents the default channel name which is
used by the Spring Integration Spring context. It will equal to the
`inputChannel` name for the Spring Integration consumer and the
`outputChannel` name for the Spring Integration provider.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options


// component options: START
The Spring Integration component supports 1 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Spring Integration endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
spring-integration:defaultChannel
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *defaultChannel* | *Required* The default channel name which is used by the Spring Integration Spring context. It will equal to the inputChannel name for the Spring Integration consumer and the outputChannel name for the Spring Integration provider. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *inOut* (common) | The exchange pattern that the Spring integration endpoint should use. If inOut=true then a reply channel is expected, either from the Spring Integration Message header or configured on the endpoint. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *inputChannel* (consumer) | The Spring integration input channel name that this endpoint wants to consume from Spring integration. |  | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *outputChannel* (producer) | The Spring integration output channel name that is used to send messages to Spring integration. |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-spring-integration-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.spring-integration.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.spring-integration.enabled* | Enable spring-integration component | true | Boolean
|===
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: END



== Usage

The Spring integration component is a bridge that connects Camel
endpoints with Spring integration endpoints through the Spring
integration's input channels and output channels. Using this component,
we can send Camel messages to Spring Integration endpoints or receive
messages from Spring integration endpoints in a Camel routing context.

== Examples

=== Using the Spring integration endpoint

You can set up a Spring integration endpoint using a URI, as follows:

Or directly using a Spring integration channel name:

=== The Source and Target adapter

Spring integration also provides the Spring integration's source and
target adapters, which can route messages from a Spring integration
channel to a Camel endpoint or from a Camel endpoint to a Spring
integration channel.

This example uses the following namespaces:

You can bind your source or target to a Camel endpoint as follows:
