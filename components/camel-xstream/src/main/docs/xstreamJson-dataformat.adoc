*Since Camel {since}*

XStream is a Data Format which uses the
http://xstream.codehaus.org/[XStream library] to marshal and unmarshal
Java objects to and from JSon. However XStream was created primary for working
with XML and therefore using JSon with XStream is not as popular as for example
Jackson is for JSon.

To use XStream in your camel routes you need to add the a dependency
on *camel-xstream* which implements this data format.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their
`pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-xstream</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----------------------------------------------------------

== Options

// dataformat options: START
include::partial$dataformat-options.adoc[]
// dataformat options: END


== Using the Java DSL

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
// lets turn Object messages into XML then send to MQSeries
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  marshal().json(JsonLibrary.XStream).
  to("mqseries:Another.Queue");
-----------------------------------------------------------
