*{component-header}*

The Openshift Builds component is one of xref:kubernetes-summary.adoc[Kubernetes Components] which
provides a producer to execute Openshift builds operations.


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END
// component options: START
== Component Options


The Openshift Builds component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

== Endpoint Options

The Openshift Builds endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
openshift-builds:masterUrl
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *masterUrl* | *Required* Kubernetes Master url |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (20 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apiVersion* (producer) | The Kubernetes API Version to use |  | String
| *dnsDomain* (producer) | The dns domain, used for ServiceCall EIP |  | String
| *kubernetesClient* (producer) | Default KubernetesClient to use if provided |  | KubernetesClient
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | Producer operation to do on Kubernetes |  | String
| *portName* (producer) | The port name, used for ServiceCall EIP |  | String
| *portProtocol* (producer) | The port protocol, used for ServiceCall EIP | tcp | String
| *connectionTimeout* (advanced) | Connection timeout in milliseconds to use when making requests to the Kubernetes API server. |  | Integer
| *caCertData* (security) | The CA Cert Data |  | String
| *caCertFile* (security) | The CA Cert File |  | String
| *clientCertData* (security) | The Client Cert Data |  | String
| *clientCertFile* (security) | The Client Cert File |  | String
| *clientKeyAlgo* (security) | The Key Algorithm used by the client |  | String
| *clientKeyData* (security) | The Client Key data |  | String
| *clientKeyFile* (security) | The Client Key file |  | String
| *clientKeyPassphrase* (security) | The Client Key Passphrase |  | String
| *oauthToken* (security) | The Auth Token |  | String
| *password* (security) | Password to connect to Kubernetes |  | String
| *trustCerts* (security) | Define if the certs we used are trusted anyway or not |  | Boolean
| *username* (security) | Username to connect to Kubernetes |  | String

== Supported producer operation

- listBuilds
- listBuildsByLabels
- getBuild

== Openshift Builds Producer Examples

- listBuilds: this operation list the Builds on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:list").
    toF("openshift-builds:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuilds").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Builds from your Openshift cluster

- listBuildsByLabels: this operation list the builds by labels on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listByLabels").process(new Processor() {
            @Override
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                Map<String, String> labels = new HashMap<>();
                labels.put("key1", "value1");
                labels.put("key2", "value2");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_BUILDS_LABELS, labels);
            }
        });
    toF("openshift-builds:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuildsByLabels").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Builds from your cluster, using a label selector (with key1 and key2, with value value1 and value2)
