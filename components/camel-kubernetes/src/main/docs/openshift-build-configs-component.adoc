= Openshift Build Config Component

*Since Camel 2.17*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The OpenShift Build Config component is one of xref:kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes Components] which
provides a producer to execute kubernetes build config operations. 


== Component Options

// component options: START
The Openshift Build Config component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

== Endpoint Options

// endpoint options: START
The Openshift Build Config endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
openshift-build-configs:masterUrl

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

| *connectionTimeout* (advanced) | Connection timeout in milliseconds to use when making requests to the Kubernetes API server. |  | Integer
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

== Supported producer operation

- listBuildConfigs
- listBuildConfigsByLabels
- getBuildConfig

== Openshift Build Configs Producer Examples

- listBuilds: this operation list the Build Configs on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:list").
    toF("openshift-build-configs:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuildConfigs").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Builds from your Openshift cluster

- listBuildsByLabels: this operation list the build configs by labels on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listByLabels").process(new Processor() {

            @Override
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                Map<String, String> labels = new HashMap<>();
                labels.put("key1", "value1");
                labels.put("key2", "value2");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_BUILD_CONFIGS_LABELS, labels);
            }
        });
    toF("openshift-build-configs:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuildConfigsByLabels").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Build configs from your cluster, using a label selector (with key1 and key2, with value value1 and value2)
