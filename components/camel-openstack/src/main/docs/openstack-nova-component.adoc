= OpenStack Nova Component

*Since Camel 2.19*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Openstack Nova component allows messages to be sent to an OpenStack compute services.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-openstack</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.


== URI Format

[source,java]
----------------------------
openstack-nova://hosturl[?options]
----------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format
`?options=value&option2=value&...`

== URI Options

// component options: START
The OpenStack Nova component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The OpenStack Nova endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
openstack-nova:host
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* | *Required* OpenStack host url |  | String

=== Query Parameters (11 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apiVersion* (producer) | OpenStack API version. The value can be one of: V2, V3 | V3 | String
| *config* (producer) | OpenStack configuration |  | Config
| *domain* (producer) | Authentication domain | default | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message).

By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean

| *username* (producer) | *Required* OpenStack username |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END



== Usage
You can use following settings for each subsystem:

== flavors

=== Operations you can perform with the Flavor producer

|=========================================================================
|Operation | Description

|`create` | Create new flavor.

|`get` | Get the flavor.

|`getAll` | Get all flavors.
