*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The http://vertx.io/[Vert.x] WebSocket component provides WebSocket capabilities as a WebSocket server, or as a client to connect to existing an WebSocket.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-vertx-websocket</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------
vertx-websocket://hostname[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
---------------------------

== Options



// component options: START
The Vert.x WebSocket component supports 7 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *router* (advanced) | To provide a custom vertx router to use on the WebSocket server |  | Router
| *vertx* (advanced) | To use an existing vertx instead of creating a new instance |  | Vertx
| *vertxOptions* (advanced) | To provide a custom set of vertx options for configuring vertx |  | VertxOptions
| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Vert.x WebSocket endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
vertx-websocket:host:port/path
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* | The host that the consumer should bind to or the host of the remote websocket destination that the producer should connect to | 0.0.0.0 | String
| *port* | The port that the consumer should bind to or port of the remote websocket destination that the producer should connect to | 0 | int
| *path* | *Required* The path that the consumer should bind to or path of the remote websocket destination that the producer should connect to | / | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (12 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *allowedOriginPattern* (consumer) | Regex pattern to match the origin header sent by WebSocket clients |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *router* (consumer) | To use an existing vertx router for the HTTP server |  | Router
| *serverOptions* (consumer) | Sets customized options for configuring the HTTP server hosting the WebSocket for the consumer |  | HttpServerOptions
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *clientOptions* (producer) | Sets customized options for configuring the WebSocket client used in the producer |  | HttpClientOptions
| *clientSubProtocols* (producer) | Comma separated list of WebSocket subprotocols that the client should use for the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *sendToAll* (producer) | To send to all websocket subscribers. Can be used to configure on endpoint level, instead of having to use the VertxWebsocketConstants.SEND_TO_ALL header on the message. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters |  | SSLContextParameters
|===
// endpoint options: END


=== Message Headers

The WebSocket component uses 2 headers to indicate to either send
messages back to a single/current client, or to all clients.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Description
|`VertxWebsocketConstants.SEND_TO_ALL` |Sends the message to all clients which are currently connected. You can
use the `sendToAll` option on the endpoint instead of using this header.
|`VertxWebsocketConstants.CONNECTION_KEY` |Sends the message to the client with the given connection key. You can
use a comma separated list of keys to send a message to multiple clients
|=======================================================================

=== Usage
The following example shows how to expose a WebSocket on http://localhost:8080/echo and returns an 'echo' response back to the same channel:

[source,java]
----
from("vertx-websocket:localhost:8080/echo")
    .transform().simple("Echo: ${body}")
    .to("vertx-websocket:localhost:8080/echo");
----

==== SSL

By default the `ws://` protocol is used, but secure connections with `wss://` are supported by configuring the consumer or producer
via the `sslContextParameters` URI parameter and the xref:manual::camel-configuration-utilities.adoc[Camel JSSE Configuration Utility]
