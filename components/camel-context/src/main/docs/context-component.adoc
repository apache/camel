## Camel Context Component

*Available as of Camel 2.7*

The *context* component allows you to create new Camel Components from a
CamelContext with a number of routes which is then treated as a black
box, allowing you to refer to the local endpoints within the component
from other CamelContexts.

It is similar to the link:routebox.html[Routebox] component in idea,
though the Context component tries to be really simple for end users;
just a simple convention over configuration approach to refer to local
endpoints inside the CamelContext Component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-context</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
context:camelContextId:localEndpointName[?options]
--------------------------------------------------

Or you can omit the "context:" prefix.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------
camelContextId:localEndpointName[?options]
------------------------------------------



// component options: START
The Camel Context component has no options.
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Camel Context component supports 6 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| contextId | common |  | String | *Required* Is the ID you used to register the CamelContext into the Registry.
| localEndpointUrl | common |  | String | *Required* Can be a valid Camel URI evaluated within the black box CamelContext. Or it can be a logical name which is mapped to any local endpoints. For example if you locally have endpoints like direct:invoices and seda:purchaseOrders inside a CamelContext of id supplyChain then you can just use the URIs supplyChain:invoices or supplyChain:purchaseOrders to omit the physical endpoint kind and use pure logical URIs.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// endpoint options: END


You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Example

In this example we'll create a black box context, then we'll use it from
another CamelContext.

#### Defining the context component

First you need to create a CamelContext, add some routes in it, start it
and then register the CamelContext into the link:registry.html[Registry]
(JNDI, Spring, Guice or OSGi etc).

This can be done in the usual Camel way from this
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/components/camel-context/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/context/JavaDslBlackBoxTest.java?revision=1069442&view=markup[test
case] (see the createRegistry() method); this example shows Java and
JNDI being used...

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// lets create our black box as a camel context and a set of routes
DefaultCamelContext blackBox = new DefaultCamelContext(registry);
blackBox.setName("blackBox");
blackBox.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        // receive purchase orders, lets process it in some way then send an invoice
        // to our invoice endpoint
        from("direct:purchaseOrder").
          setHeader("received").constant("true").
          to("direct:invoice");
    }
});
blackBox.start();

registry.bind("accounts", blackBox);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice in the above route we are using pure local endpoints (*direct*
and *seda*). Also note we expose this CamelContext using the *accounts*
ID. We can do the same thing in Spring via

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext id="accounts" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route> 
    <from uri="direct:purchaseOrder"/>
    ...
    <to uri="direct:invoice"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Using the context component

Then in another CamelContext we can then refer to this "accounts black
box" by just sending to *accounts:purchaseOrder* and consuming from
*accounts:invoice*.

If you prefer to be more verbose and explicit you could use
*context:accounts:purchaseOrder* or even
*context:accounts:direct://purchaseOrder* if you prefer. But using
logical endpoint URIs is preferred as it hides the implementation detail
and provides a simple logical naming scheme.

For example if we wish to then expose this accounts black box on some
middleware (outside of the black box) we can do things like...

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route> 
    <!-- consume from an ActiveMQ into the black box -->
    <from uri="activemq:Accounts.PurchaseOrders"/>
    <to uri="accounts:purchaseOrders"/>
  </route>
  <route> 
    <!-- lets send invoices from the black box to a different ActiveMQ Queue -->
    <from uri="accounts:invoice"/>
    <to uri="activemq:UK.Accounts.Invoices"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Naming endpoints

A context component instance can have many public input and output
endpoints that can be accessed from outside it's CamelContext. When
there are many it is recommended that you use logical names for them to
hide the middleware as shown above.

However when there is only one input, output or error/dead letter
endpoint in a component we recommend using the common posix shell names
*in*, *out* and *err*
