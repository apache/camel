An alternative is to use NotifyBuilder, and use the notifier to know when Camel is done routing some messages, before you call the assertIsSatisfied() method on the mocks. This allows you to not use a fixed assert period, to speedup testing times. If you want to assert that exactly n'th message arrives to this mock endpoint, then see also the setAssertPeriod(long) method for further details." },
