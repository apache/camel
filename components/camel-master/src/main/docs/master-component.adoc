*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Camel-Master endpoint provides a way to ensure only a single consumer in a cluster consumes from a given endpoint;
with automatic failover if that JVM dies.

This can be very useful if you need to consume from some legacy back end which either doesn't support concurrent
consumption or due to commercial or stability reasons you can only have a single connection at any point in time.

== Using the master endpoint

Just prefix any camel endpoint with **master:someName:** where _someName_ is a logical name and is
used to acquire the master lock. e.g.

[source,java]
----
from("master:cheese:jms:foo").to("activemq:wine");
----

The above simulates the [Exclusive Consumers](http://activemq.apache.org/exclusive-consumer.html) type feature in
ActiveMQ; but on any third party JMS provider which maybe doesn't support exclusive consumers.


== URI format

----
master:namespace:endpoint[?options]
----

Where endpoint is any Camel endpoint you want to run in master/slave mode.


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or
directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END
// component options: START
== Component Options


The Master component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *service* (advanced) | Inject the service to use. |  | CamelClusterService
| *serviceSelector* (advanced) | Inject the service selector used to lookup the CamelClusterService to use. |  | Selector
|===
// component options: END
// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The Master endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
master:namespace:delegateUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *namespace* | *Required* The name of the cluster namespace to use |  | String
| *delegateUri* | *Required* The endpoint uri to use in master/slave mode |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Example

You can protect a clustered Camel application to only consume files from one active node.


[source,java]
----
// the file endpoint we want to consume from
String url = "file:target/inbox?delete=true";

// use the camel master component in the clustered group named myGroup
// to run a master/slave mode in the following Camel url
from("master:myGroup:" + url)
    .log(name + " - Received file: ${file:name}")
    .delay(delay)
    .log(name + " - Done file:     ${file:name}")
    .to("file:target/outbox");
----

The master component leverages CamelClusterService you can configure using

* *Java*
+
[source,java]
----
ZooKeeperClusterService service = new ZooKeeperClusterService();
service.setId("camel-node-1");
service.setNodes("myzk:2181");
service.setBasePath("/camel/cluster");

context.addService(service)
