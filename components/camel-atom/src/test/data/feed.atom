    <title type='text'>More thoughts on RESTful Message Queues</title>
    <content type='html'>Just a small follow up on my previous &lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;a
      style="font-weight: normal;" href="http://macstrac.blogspot.com/2007/08/pure-restful-api-to-activemq-via.html"&gt;Pure
      RESTful API to ActiveMQ via AtomPub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. AtomPub rocks and all - I was thinking whats the
      easiest possible RESTful client to subscribe to a message queue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;GET
      queues/foo.bar?user=myUniqueId&amp;amp;timeout=5000&lt;/blockquote&gt;This would activate my subscription to the
      queue &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;foo.bar&lt;/span&gt; (or help to keep it alive) and return my own
      list of messages as an Atom feed that I am allowed to view and DELETE when I have consumed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
      /&gt;This operation is idempotent and would work great with proxies and caches (assuming the right HTTP headers /
      ETags stuff) letting clients to keep GETing as often as they like. Though if you don't use the subscription for
      period of time, your subscription can go stale and timeout; any messages in your message collection could be
      removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slightly smelly thing here is we need to either use cookies (such as for HTTP
      session handling with servlets) or use a custom session ID header in the URL to uniquely differentiate the
      subscriptions. Anyone got a better idea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we could demand that clients PUT/POST to
      get a new Location URL on which to GET their subscriptions; but this would require a custom REST client.

    <title type='text'>Feedback on my Camel talk at the IJTC conference</title>
    <content type='html'>Thanks to &lt;a href="http://capedcrusading.blogspot.com/"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a
      href="http://capedcrusading.blogspot.com/2007/11/ijtc-conference-spring-grails-camel.html"&gt;great feedback on my
      Camel talk&lt;/a&gt; (and other talks too). I started to write a huge reply and figured I'd post it here instead
      then link to it as its easier to reply to different parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Camel itself is not an ESB
      per-se, it is a component of an ESB &lt;/blockquote&gt;Agreed. The idea is Camel does the routing and &lt;a
      href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/enterprise-integration-patterns.html" title="Enterprise Integration
      Patterns"&gt;Enterprise Integration Patterns&lt;/a&gt; - you can then use it inside a web service stack like &lt;span
      class="nobr"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cxf/" title="Visit page outside Confluence"
      rel="nofollow"&gt;Apache CXF&lt;/a&gt;, a message broker like &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
      class="nobr"&gt;&lt;a href="http://activemq.apache.org/" title="Visit page outside Confluence" rel="nofollow"&gt;Apache
      ActiveMQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or an ESB like&lt;span class="nobr"&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://incubator.apache.org/servicemix/" title="Visit page outside Confluence" rel="nofollow"&gt; Apache
      ServiceMix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. One of the key messages that came out of the
      session was how Java-centric the Camel solution is - Strachan went so far as to articulate the view that coding in
      XML was a fundamentally bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Maybe being the author of &lt;a
      href="http://commons.apache.org/jelly/"&gt;Jelly&lt;/a&gt; and hating writing XSLT has made me a bit too sensitive
      to the idea of programming by XML. Quite a few customers I talk with report frustration of too much XML hacking
      with Spring (which is being addressed in Guice and Spring 2.5). But heck if you like programming in XML be my
      guest :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He went on to cast aspersions on graphical tools also. His clear preference
      was that integration logic should be written in Java. Given that I have worked with highly skilled Java developers
      for many years now I was not too surprised to hear this - many good developers shy away from tooling, seeing it as
      compromising their style or the power of the underlying framework - hence the longevity of vi and emacs I suppose.&lt;br
      /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I didn't mean to cast aspersions on graphical tools; more that pretty much all developers
      understand Java these days, its pretty universal - whereas most complex graphical tools require a fair amount of
      learning to get used to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I totally prefer writing in Java rather than XML
      or using visual tooling but one of the main requirements of Camel is that you can configure and specify routes in
      any way you like - via a graphical IDE (e.g. Cimero) or via XML or Java or Groovy or Ruby or one day hopefully a
      real DSL. Using XML is quite useful as you can just drop your routing rules inside a spring XML file such as
      inside the &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nobr"&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://activemq.apache.org/" title="Visit page outside Confluence" rel="nofollow"&gt;Apache ActiveMQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br
      /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we're working hard to allow folks to specify routing rules however they like - despite what I
      prefer :). Irrespective of how you write your routing rules, we can &lt;a
      href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/visualisation.html"&gt;visualise them&lt;/a&gt; so anyone can easily
      understand them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;However it is important to note that all developers are not
      middleware experts and have no wish to be. Indeed the enterprises they work for want their developers to spend as
      little time and effort as possible on middleware plumbing. They need and demand tools which will enable them to
      get at least 80% of patterns done without having to understand the middleware architecture, it's threading model,&lt;br
      /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thats one of the main things we're trying to attempt with Camel - letting folks who are
      not middleware experts easily use the &lt;a
      href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/enterprise-integration-patterns.html" title="Enterprise Integration
      Patterns"&gt;Enterprise Integration Patterns&lt;/a&gt; using a single line of Java code - using &lt;a
      href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/components.html"&gt;any transport or component &lt;/a&gt;with minimal
      configuration required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;it's support for configurable expression languages etc.&lt;br
      /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I find it hard to understand how any tool can be usable by folks without some kind of
      expression language that they understand - whether its Java or SQL or XPath/XQuery or whatnot. Even a visual query
      definer is a language that users need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Most people express their requirements
      in a declarative way- I have data at A that needs to get to B, on it's way I need to perform transformation,
      validation, logging etc. (indeed the EIP book itself does this) . However Camel has taken a very Java centric
      approach and I think this increases it's complexity unnecessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;We are actually
      trying to be as declarative as possible - don't let the fact that you can use Java as the DSL confuse you. e.g.
      here's what you just described in Camel using a single line of Java code...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;from(a).&lt;br
      /&gt;to("xsd:org/cheese/something.xsd").&lt;br /&gt;to("xslt:com/acme/mytransform.xsl").&lt;br /&gt;to("log:com.acme.MyLogger").&lt;br
      /&gt;to(b);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Its hard to be more concise than that in Java code. But sure - you could
      use some other language or XML or UI tool etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Camel presents transports as
      nice-simple looking endpoint URIs in Java. However configuration of these transports may not be as simple as it
      seems. There appears to me to be a potential disconnection between the Camel processors and the Camel Components
      in terms of configuration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;You can always configure anything in Camel via Java or
      Spring; a component, endpoint, processor etc. The URI is just a shorthand notation for configurating things; which
      tends to work well with endpoints as usually all the smart configuration is in the component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In
      the presentation processors use endpoints which can be configured using Spring within Camel. However it would
      appear that many of the component implementations are inherited from ServiceMix and these properties will need to
      be set presumably within the ServiceMix container configuration? &lt;/blockquote&gt;Not so - all the components
      are configured in Spring via Camel. If you want to talk to ServiceMix components and endpoints you can use the NMR
      and the &lt;a href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/jbi.html"&gt;JBI endpoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When
      you have multiple XML configurations to use a transport then the pretty looking URI is hiding a lot of complexity
      under the hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I hear you. We've tried very hard to make things as easy as is
      possible with minimal configuration; for example most configuration tends to be on the Component rather than the
      Endpoint. But you can configure things however you like in Java code or Guice or Spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3.
      Some of the pattern implementations look a little short on credibility - take the aggregator pattern for example
      the "aggregator" pattern does not seem to have the concept of a store - so in essence one must have access to all
      of the messages which require aggregation or must hold aggregations in memory for the configurable timeout period.
      This will clearly not work in a scalable way. Likewise as regards clustering - if you are looking to aggregate 2
      messages and they turn up on different servers you gotta problem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You're right I purposely
      missed out some of the detail on a few slides (such as specifying some kind of persistence store or strategy for
      aggregator or for idempotent consumer) but that is easily done via a pluggable strategies Spring beans. However
      just because I missed out some detail on some slides (its kinda hard in an hour to present all the detail in all
      the patterns as well as the rest of Camel) please don't think that somehow Camel isn't short on capabilities.&lt;br
      /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To summarise Camel is clearly a worthy set of widgets and they will work for very simple
      applications without Enterprise requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ouch :). We've actually lots of
      customers using Camel today in production with very Enterprise requirements. &lt;span class="nobr"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
      href="http://activemq.apache.org/" title="Visit page outside Confluence" rel="nofollow"&gt;Apache ActiveMQ&lt;/a&gt;
      5.0 actually ships &lt;a href="http://activemq.apache.org/enterprise-integration-patterns.html"&gt;fully
      integrated with Camel&lt;/a&gt; so we've tons of users in production using Camel today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I
      hope I've managed to straighten out some misunderstandings on Camel; its definitely a great fit for enterprise
      requirements. Thanks for your great feedback - I'll definitely take it on board on future presentations and try
      and avoid confusing other folks :).
