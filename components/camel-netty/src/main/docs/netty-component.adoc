*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Netty component in Camel is a socket communication component,
based on the http://netty.io/[Netty] project version 4.
Netty is a NIO client server framework that enables quick and easy
development of networkServerInitializerFactory applications such as
protocol servers and clients.
Netty greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as
TCP and UDP socket server.

This Camel component supports both producer and consumer endpoints.

The Netty component has several options and allows fine-grained control
of a number of TCP/UDP communication parameters (buffer sizes,
`keepAlive`, `tcpNoDelay`, etc.), and facilitates both In-Only and In-Out
communication on a Camel route.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-netty</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== URI format

The URI scheme for a netty component is as follows

.TCP
----
netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:99999[?options]
----

.UDP
----
netty:udp://remotehost:99999/[?options]
----


This component supports producer and consumer endpoints for both TCP and
UDP.

== Registry-based Options

Codec Handlers and SSL Keystores can be enlisted in the Registry, such as in the Spring XML file.
The values that could be passed in are the following:

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Description

|`passphrase` |password setting to use to encrypt/decrypt payloads sent using
SSH

|`keyStoreFormat` |keystore format to be used for payload encryption. Defaults to `JKS` if
not set

|`securityProvider` |Security provider to be used for payload encryption. Defaults to
`SunX509` if not set.

|`keyStoreFile` |*deprecated:* Client side certificate keystore to be used for encryption

|`trustStoreFile` |*deprecated:* Server side certificate keystore to be used for encryption

|`keyStoreResource` |Client side certificate keystore to be used for
encryption. It is loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with
`"classpath:"`, `"file:"`, or `"http:"` to load the resource from
different systems.

|`trustStoreResource` |Server side certificate keystore to be used for
encryption. It is loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with
`"classpath:"`, `"file:"`, or `"http:"` to load the resource from
different systems.

|`sslHandler` |Reference to a class that could be used to return an SSL Handler

|`encoder` |A custom `ChannelHandler` class that can be used to perform special
marshalling of outbound payloads. Must override
`io.netty.channel.ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter`.

|`encoders` |A list of encoders to be used. You can use a string that has values
separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the
Registry. Remember to prefix the value with `#` so Camel knows it should look up.

|`decoder` |A custom `ChannelHandler` class that can be used to perform special
marshalling of inbound payloads. Must override
`io.netty.channel.ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter`.

|`decoders` |A list of decoders to be used. You can use a string that has values
separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the
Registry. Remember to prefix the value with `#`
so Camel knows it should look up.

Read below about using non-shareable encoders/decoders.

[[Netty-NonShareableEncodersOrDecoders]]
=== Using non-shareable encoders or decoders

If your encoders or decoders are not shareable (e.g., they don't have the
@Shareable class annotation), then your encoder/decoder must implement
the `org.apache.camel.component.netty.ChannelHandlerFactory` interface,
and return a new instance in the `newChannelHandler` method. This is to
ensure the encoder/decoder can safely be used. If this is not the case,
then the Netty component will log a WARN when an endpoint is created.

The Netty component offers a
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.ChannelHandlerFactories` factory
class, that has a number of commonly used methods.

== Sending Messages to/from a Netty endpoint

=== Netty Producer

In Producer mode, the component provides the ability to send payloads to
a socket endpoint using either TCP or UDP protocols (with optional SSL support).

The producer mode supports both one-way and request-response based operations.

=== Netty Consumer

In Consumer mode, the component provides the ability to:

* listen to a specified socket using either TCP or UDP protocols (with
optional SSL support),
* receive requests on the socket using text/xml, binary and serialized
object-based payloads and
* send them along on a route as message exchanges.

The consumer mode supports both one-way and request-response based
operations.

=== Using Multiple Codecs

In certain cases, it may be necessary to add chains of encoders and
decoders to the netty pipeline.
To add multiple codecs to a Camel netty endpoint, the `encoders` and
`decoders` uri parameters should be used.
Like the `encoder` and `decoder` parameters they are used to supply
references (lists of `ChannelUpstreamHandlers` and
`ChannelDownstreamHandlers`) that should be added to the pipeline.

Note that if encoders are specified, then the encoder param will be ignored,
similarly for decoders and the decoder param.

[NOTE]
====
Read further about using <<Netty-NonShareableEncodersOrDecoders,non-shareable encoders/decoders>>.
====

The lists of codecs need to be added to the Camel's registry, so they can
be resolved when the endpoint is created.

[source,java]
----
ChannelHandlerFactory lengthDecoder = ChannelHandlerFactories.newLengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder(1048576, 0, 4, 0, 4);

StringDecoder stringDecoder = new StringDecoder();
registry.bind("length-decoder", lengthDecoder);
registry.bind("string-decoder", stringDecoder);

LengthFieldPrepender lengthEncoder = new LengthFieldPrepender(4);
StringEncoder stringEncoder = new StringEncoder();
registry.bind("length-encoder", lengthEncoder);
registry.bind("string-encoder", stringEncoder);

List<ChannelHandler> decoders = new ArrayList<ChannelHandler>();
decoders.add(lengthDecoder);
decoders.add(stringDecoder);

List<ChannelHandler> encoders = new ArrayList<ChannelHandler>();
encoders.add(lengthEncoder);
encoders.add(stringEncoder);

registry.bind("encoders", encoders);
registry.bind("decoders", decoders);
----

Spring's native collections support can be used to specify the codec
lists in an application context

[source,xml]
----
<util:list id="decoders" list-class="java.util.LinkedList">
        <bean class="org.apache.camel.component.netty.ChannelHandlerFactories" factory-method="newLengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder">

            <constructor-arg value="4"/>
            <constructor-arg value="0"/>
            <constructor-arg value="4"/>
        </bean>
        <bean class="io.netty.handler.codec.string.StringDecoder"/>
    </util:list>

    <util:list id="encoders" list-class="java.util.LinkedList">
        <bean class="io.netty.handler.codec.LengthFieldPrepender">
            <constructor-arg value="4"/>
        </bean>
        <bean class="io.netty.handler.codec.string.StringEncoder"/>
    </util:list>

    <bean id="length-encoder" class="io.netty.handler.codec.LengthFieldPrepender">
        <constructor-arg value="4"/>
    </bean>
    <bean id="string-encoder" class="io.netty.handler.codec.string.StringEncoder"/>

    <bean id="length-decoder" class="org.apache.camel.component.netty.ChannelHandlerFactories" factory-method="newLengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder">

        <constructor-arg value="4"/>
    </bean>
    <bean id="string-decoder" class="io.netty.handler.codec.string.StringDecoder"/>
----

The bean names can then be used in netty endpoint definitions either as
a comma-separated list or contained in a list, e.g.:

[tabs]

== Closing Channel When Complete

When acting as a server, you sometimes want to close the channel when,
for example, a client conversion is finished.
You can do this by simply setting the endpoint option `disconnect=true`.

However, you can also instruct Camel on a per-message basis as follows.
To instruct Camel to close the channel, you should add a header with
the key `CamelNettyCloseChannelWhenComplete` set to a boolean `true`
value.
For instance, the example below will close the channel after it has
written the bye message back to the client:

[source,java]
----
from("netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:8080").process(new Processor() {
    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
        String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
        exchange.getOut().setBody("Bye " + body);
        // some condition that determines if we should close
        if (close) {
            exchange.getOut().setHeader(NettyConstants.NETTY_CLOSE_CHANNEL_WHEN_COMPLETE, true);
        }
    }
});
----

[[Netty-Addingcustomchannelpipelinefactoriestogaincompletecontroloveracreatedpipeline]]
Adding custom channel pipeline factories to gain complete control over a created pipeline

== Custom pipeline

Custom channel pipelines provide complete control to the user over the
handler/interceptor chain by inserting custom handler(s), encoder(s) &
decoder(s) without having to specify them in the Netty Endpoint URL in a
straightforward way.

To add a custom pipeline, a custom channel pipeline factory
must be created and registered with the context via the context registry
(or the camel-spring `ApplicationContextRegistry`, etc).

A custom pipeline factory must be constructed as follows

* A Producer-linked channel pipeline factory must extend the abstract
class `ClientInitializerFactory`.
* A Consumer-linked channel pipeline factory must extend the abstract
class `ServerInitializerFactory`.
* The classes should override the `initChannel()` method to
insert custom handler(s), encoder(s) and decoder(s). Not overriding the
`initChannel()` method creates a pipeline with no handlers, encoders or
decoders wired to the pipeline.

The example below shows how `ServerInitializerFactory` factory may be
created

=== Using custom pipeline factory

[source,java]
----
public class SampleServerInitializerFactory extends ServerInitializerFactory {
    private int maxLineSize = 1024;

    protected void initChannel(Channel ch) throws Exception {
        ChannelPipeline channelPipeline = ch.pipeline();

        channelPipeline.addLast("encoder-SD", new StringEncoder(CharsetUtil.UTF_8));
        channelPipeline.addLast("decoder-DELIM", new DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder(maxLineSize, true, Delimiters.lineDelimiter()));
        channelPipeline.addLast("decoder-SD", new StringDecoder(CharsetUtil.UTF_8));
        // here we add the default Camel ServerChannelHandler for the consumer, to allow Camel to route the message, etc.
        channelPipeline.addLast("handler", new ServerChannelHandler(consumer));
    }
}
----

The custom channel pipeline factory can then be added to the registry
and instantiated/utilized on a Camel route in the following way

[source,java]
----
Registry registry = camelContext.getRegistry();
ServerInitializerFactory factory = new TestServerInitializerFactory();
registry.bind("spf", factory);
context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
  public void configure() {
      String netty_ssl_endpoint =
         "netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5150?serverInitializerFactory=#spf"
      String return_string =
         "When You Go Home, Tell Them Of Us And Say,"
         + "For Your Tomorrow, We Gave Our Today.";

      from(netty_ssl_endpoint)
       .process(new Processor() {
          public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            exchange.getOut().setBody(return_string);
          }
       }
  }
});
----

== Reusing Netty boss and worker thread pools

Netty has two kinds of thread pools: boss and worker. By default, each
Netty consumer and producer has their private thread pools. If you want
to reuse these thread pools among multiple consumers or producers, then
the thread pools must be created and enlisted in the
Registry.

For example, using Spring XML we can create a shared worker thread pool
using the `NettyWorkerPoolBuilder` with two worker threads as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- use the worker pool builder to help create the shared thread pool -->
<bean id="poolBuilder" class="org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyWorkerPoolBuilder">
  <property name="workerCount" value="2"/>
</bean>

<!-- the shared worker thread pool -->
<bean id="sharedPool" class="org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.WorkerPool"
      factory-bean="poolBuilder" factory-method="build" destroy-method="shutdown">
</bean>
----

[TIP]
====
For boss thread pool there is a
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyServerBossPoolBuilder` builder
for Netty consumers, and a
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyClientBossPoolBuilder` for the
Netty producers.
====

Then in the Camel routes we can refer to this worker pools by
configuring the `workerPool` option in the URI as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5021?textline=true&amp;sync=true&amp;workerPool=#sharedPool&amp;usingExecutorService=false"/>
  <to uri="log:result"/>
  ...
</route>
----

And if we have another route, we can refer to the shared worker pool:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5022?textline=true&amp;sync=true&amp;workerPool=#sharedPool&amp;usingExecutorService=false"/>
  <to uri="log:result"/>
  ...
</route>
----

And so forth.

== Multiplexing concurrent messages over a single connection with request/reply

When using Netty for request/reply messaging via the netty producer, then by default, each
message is sent via a non-shared connection (pooled). This ensures that replies are
automatic being able to map to the correct request thread for further routing in Camel.
In other words, correlation between request/reply messages happens out-of-the-box because
the replies come back on the same connection that was used for sending the request;
and this connection is not shared with others. When the response comes back, the connection
is returned to the connection pool, where it can be reused by others.

However, if you want to multiplex concurrent request/responses on a single shared connection,
then you need to turn off the connection pooling by setting `producerPoolEnabled=false`.
Now this means there is a potential issue with interleaved responses if replies come back out-of-order.
Therefore, you need to have a correlation id in both the request and reply messages, so you can properly
correlate the replies to the Camel callback that is responsible for continue processing the message in Camel.
To do this, you need to implement `NettyCamelStateCorrelationManager` as correlation manager and configure
it via the `correlationManager=#myManager` option.

[NOTE]
====
We recommend extending the `TimeoutCorrelationManagerSupport` when you build custom correlation managers.
This provides support for timeout and other complexities you otherwise would need to implement as well.
====

You can find an example with the Apache Camel source code in the examples directory
under the `camel-example-netty-custom-correlation` directory.

== Native transport

To enable native transport, you need to add additional dependency for epoll or kqueue depending on your OS and CPU arch.
To make it easier add the following extension to your `build` section of `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<extensions>
    <extension>
        <groupId>kr.motd.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>os-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </extension>
</extensions>
----

So then you need to add the following dependency:

[tabs]
====
Linux/Unix::
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-transport-native-epoll</artifactId>
    <classifier>${os.detected.classifier}</classifier>
</dependency>
----

MacOS/BSD::
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
    <artifactId>netty-transport-native-kqueue</artifactId>
    <classifier>${os.detected.classifier}</classifier>
</dependency>
----

== Examples

=== A UDP Netty endpoint using Request-Reply and serialized object payload

Note that Object serialization is not allowed by default, and so a decoder must be configured.

[source,java]
----
@BindToRegistry("decoder")
public ChannelHandler getDecoder() throws Exception {
    return new DefaultChannelHandlerFactory() {
        @Override
        public ChannelHandler newChannelHandler() {
            return new DatagramPacketObjectDecoder(ClassResolvers.weakCachingResolver(null));
        }
    };
}

RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
  public void configure() {
    from("netty:udp://0.0.0.0:5155?sync=true&decoders=#decoder")
      .process(new Processor() {
         public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
           Poetry poetry = (Poetry) exchange.getIn().getBody();
           // Process poetry in some way
           exchange.getOut().setBody("Message received);
         }
       }
    }
};

[[Netty-UsingtheJSSEConfigurationUtility]]
Using the JSSE Configuration Utility

The Netty component supports SSL/TLS configuration
through the xref:manual::camel-configuration-utilities.adoc[Camel JSSE Configuration Utility].
This utility greatly decreases the amount of component-specific code
you need to write and is configurable at the endpoint and component levels.
The following examples demonstrate how to use the utility with the Netty component.

[[Netty-GettingaccesstoSSLSessionandtheclientcertificate]]
Getting access to SSLSession and the client certificate

You can get access to the `javax.net.ssl.SSLSession` if you e.g., need to
get details about the client certificate. When `ssl=true` then the
xref:netty-component.adoc[Netty] component will store the `SSLSession` as a
header on the Camel Message as shown below:

[source,java]
----
SSLSession session = exchange.getIn().getHeader(NettyConstants.NETTY_SSL_SESSION, SSLSession.class);
// get the first certificate which is client certificate
javax.security.cert.X509Certificate cert = session.getPeerCertificateChain()[0];
Principal principal = cert.getSubjectDN();
----

Remember to set `needClientAuth=true` to authenticate the client,
otherwise `SSLSession` cannot access information about the client
certificate, and you may get an exception
`javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated`.
You may also get this exception if the client certificate is expired
or not valid, etc.

[TIP]
====
The option `sslClientCertHeaders` can be set to `true` which then
enriches the Camel Message with headers having
details about the client certificate. For example, the subject name is
readily available in the header `CamelNettySSLClientCertSubjectName`.
