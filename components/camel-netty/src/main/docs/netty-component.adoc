[[netty-component]]
== Netty Component (deprecated)

*Available as of Camel version 2.3*

WARNING: This component is deprecated. You should use <<netty4-component,Netty4>>.

The *netty* component in Camel is a socket communication component,
based on the http://netty.io/[Netty] project.

Netty is a NIO client server framework which enables quick and easy
development of network applications such as protocol servers and
clients. +
 Netty greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as
TCP and UDP socket server.

This camel component supports both producer and consumer endpoints.

The Netty component has several options and allows fine-grained control
of a number of TCP/UDP communication parameters (buffer sizes,
keepAlives, tcpNoDelay etc) and facilitates both In-Only and In-Out
communication on a Camel route.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-netty</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

The URI scheme for a netty component is as follows

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:99999[?options]
netty:udp://remotehost:99999/[?options]
---------------------------------------

This component supports producer and consumer endpoints for both TCP and
UDP.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options

The Netty endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
netty:protocol:host:port
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (3 parameters):

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *protocol* | *Required* The protocol to use which can be tcp or udp. |  | String
| *host* | *Required* The hostname. For the consumer the hostname is localhost or 0.0.0.0 For the producer the hostname is the remote host to connect to |  | String
| *port* | *Required* The host port number |  | int
|===


==== Query Parameters (67 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *broadcast* (consumer) | Setting to choose Multicast over UDP | false | boolean
| *clientMode* (consumer) | If the clientMode is true, netty consumer will connect the address as a TCP client. | false | boolean

| *orderedThreadPoolExecutor* (consumer) | Whether to use ordered thread pool, to ensure events are processed orderly on the same channel. See details at the netty javadoc of org.jboss.netty.handler.execution.OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor for more details. | true | boolean
| *serverClosedChannel ExceptionCaughtLogLevel* (consumer) | If the server (NettyConsumer) catches an java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException then its logged using this logging level. This is used to avoid logging the closed channel exceptions, as clients can disconnect abruptly and then cause a flood of closed exceptions in the Netty server. | DEBUG | LoggingLevel
| *serverExceptionCaughtLog Level* (consumer) | If the server (NettyConsumer) catches an exception then its logged using this logging level. | WARN | LoggingLevel
| *serverPipelineFactory* (consumer) | To use a custom ServerPipelineFactory |  | ServerPipelineFactory
| *workerCount* (consumer) | When netty works on nio mode, it uses default workerCount parameter from Netty, which is cpu_core_threads2. User can use this operation to override the default workerCount from Netty |  | int
| *workerPool* (consumer) | To use a explicit org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.WorkerPool as the worker thread pool. For example to share a thread pool with multiple consumers. By default each consumer has their own worker pool with 2 x cpu count core threads. |  | WorkerPool
| *connectTimeout* (producer) | Time to wait for a socket connection to be available. Value is in millis. | 10000 | long
| *requestTimeout* (producer) | Allows to use a timeout for the Netty producer when calling a remote server. By default no timeout is in use. The value is in milli seconds, so eg 30000 is 30 seconds. The requestTimeout is using Netty's ReadTimeoutHandler to trigger the timeout. |  | long

### Registry based Options

Codec Handlers and SSL Keystores can be enlisted in the
Registry, such as in the Spring XML file. 
The values that could be passed in, are the following:

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================

|=======================================================================

*Important:* Read below about using non shareable encoders/decoders.

#### Using non shareable encoders or decoders

If your encoders or decoders is not shareable (eg they have the
@Shareable class annotation), then your encoder/decoder must implement
the `org.apache.camel.component.netty.ChannelHandlerFactory` interface,
and return a new instance in the `newChannelHandler` method. This is to
ensure the encoder/decoder can safely be used. If this is not the case,
then the Netty component will log a WARN when +
 an endpoint is created.

The Netty component offers a
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.ChannelHandlerFactories` factory
class, that has a number of commonly used methods.

### Sending Messages to/from a Netty endpoint

#### Netty Producer

In Producer mode, the component provides the ability to send payloads to
a socket endpoint +
 using either TCP or UDP protocols (with optional SSL support).

The producer mode supports both one-way and request-response based
operations.

#### Netty Consumer

In Consumer mode, the component provides the ability to:

* listen on a specified socket using either TCP or UDP protocols (with
optional SSL support),
* receive requests on the socket using text/xml, binary and serialized
object based payloads and
* send them along on a route as message exchanges.

The consumer mode supports both one-way and request-response based
operations.

### Headers

The following headers are filled for the exchanges created by the Netty
consumer:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header key |Class |Description

|`NettyConstants.NETTY_CHANNEL_HANDLER_CONTEXT` /
`CamelNettyChannelHandlerContext` |`org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext` | `ChannelHandlerContext `instance associated with the connection received
by netty.

|`NettyConstants.NETTY_MESSAGE_EVENT` / `CamelNettyMessageEvent` |`org.jboss.netty.channel.MessageEvent` |`MessageEvent `instance associated with the connection received by
netty.

|`NettyConstants.NETTY_REMOTE_ADDRESS` / `CamelNettyRemoteAddress` |`java.net.SocketAddress` |Remote address of the incoming socket connection.

|`NettyConstants.NETTY_LOCAL_ADDRESS` / `CamelNettyLocalAddress` |`java.net.SocketAddress` |Local address of the incoming socket connection.
|=======================================================================

[[Netty-UsingtheJSSEConfigurationUtility]]
Using the JSSE Configuration Utility

As of Camel 2.9, the Netty component supports SSL/TLS configuration
through the link:camel-configuration-utilities.html[Camel JSSE
Configuration Utility].  This utility greatly decreases the amount of
component specific code you need to write and is configurable at the
endpoint and component levels.  The following examples demonstrate how
to use the utility with the Netty component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Netty-GettingaccesstoSSLSessionandtheclientcertificate]]
Getting access to SSLSession and the client certificate

*Available as of Camel 2.12*

You can get access to the `javax.net.ssl.SSLSession` if you eg need to
get details about the client certificate. When `ssl=true` then the
<<netty-component,Netty>> component will store the `SSLSession` as a header
on the Camel Message as shown below:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SSLSession session = exchange.getIn().getHeader(NettyConstants.NETTY_SSL_SESSION, SSLSession.class);
// get the first certificate which is client certificate
javax.security.cert.X509Certificate cert = session.getPeerCertificateChain()[0];
Principal principal = cert.getSubjectDN();
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember to set `needClientAuth=true` to authenticate the client,
otherwise `SSLSession` cannot access information about the client
certificate, and you may get an exception
`javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated`. You
may also get this exception if the client certificate is expired or not
valid etc.

TIP: The option `sslClientCertHeaders` can be set to `true` which then
enriches the Camel Message with headers having
details about the client certificate. For example the subject name is
readily available in the header `CamelNettySSLClientCertSubjectName`.

#### Using Multiple Codecs

In certain cases it may be necessary to add chains of encoders and
decoders to the netty pipeline. To add multpile codecs to a camel netty
endpoint the 'encoders' and 'decoders' uri parameters should be used.
Like the 'encoder' and 'decoder' parameters they are used to supply
references (to lists of ChannelUpstreamHandlers and
ChannelDownstreamHandlers) that should be added to the pipeline. Note
that if encoders is specified then the encoder param will be ignored,
similarly for decoders and the decoder param.

INFO: Read further above about using non shareable encoders/decoders.

The lists of codecs need to be added to the Camel's registry so they can
be resolved when the endpoint is created.

Spring's native collections support can be used to specify the codec
lists in an application context

The bean names can then be used in netty endpoint definitions either as
a comma separated list or contained in a List e.g.

or via spring.

### Closing Channel When Complete

When acting as a server you sometimes want to close the channel when,
for example, a client conversion is finished. +
 You can do this by simply setting the endpoint option
`disconnect=true`.

However you can also instruct Camel on a per message basis as follows. +
 To instruct Camel to close the channel, you should add a header with
the key `CamelNettyCloseChannelWhenComplete` set to a boolean `true`
value. +
 For instance, the example below will close the channel after it has
written the bye message back to the client:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        from("netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:8080").process(new Processor() {
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
                exchange.getOut().setBody("Bye " + body);
                // some condition which determines if we should close
                if (close) {
                    exchange.getOut().setHeader(NettyConstants.NETTY_CLOSE_CHANNEL_WHEN_COMPLETE, true);
                }
            }
        });
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Adding custom channel pipeline factories to gain complete control over a created pipeline

*Available as of Camel 2.5*

Custom channel pipelines provide complete control to the user over the
handler/interceptor chain by inserting custom handler(s), encoder(s) &
decoders without having to specify them in the Netty Endpoint URL in a
very simple way.

In order to add a custom pipeline, a custom channel pipeline factory
must be created and registered with the context via the context registry
(JNDIRegistry,or the camel-spring ApplicationContextRegistry etc).

A custom pipeline factory must be constructed as follows

* A Producer linked channel pipeline factory must extend the abstract
class `ClientPipelineFactory`.
* A Consumer linked channel pipeline factory must extend the abstract
class `ServerPipelineFactory`.
* The classes should override the getPipeline() method in order to
insert custom handler(s), encoder(s) and decoder(s). Not overriding the
getPipeline() method creates a pipeline with no handlers, encoders or
decoders wired to the pipeline.

The example below shows how ServerChannel Pipeline factory may be
created

*Using custom pipeline factory*

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class SampleServerChannelPipelineFactory extends ServerPipelineFactory {
    private int maxLineSize = 1024;

    public ChannelPipeline getPipeline() throws Exception {
        ChannelPipeline channelPipeline = Channels.pipeline();

        channelPipeline.addLast("encoder-SD", new StringEncoder(CharsetUtil.UTF_8));
        channelPipeline.addLast("decoder-DELIM", new DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder(maxLineSize, true, Delimiters.lineDelimiter()));
        channelPipeline.addLast("decoder-SD", new StringDecoder(CharsetUtil.UTF_8));
        // here we add the default Camel ServerChannelHandler for the consumer, to allow Camel to route the message etc.
        channelPipeline.addLast("handler", new ServerChannelHandler(consumer));

        return channelPipeline;
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The custom channel pipeline factory can then be added to the registry
and instantiated/utilized on a camel route in the following way

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Registry registry = camelContext.getRegistry();
serverPipelineFactory = new TestServerChannelPipelineFactory();
registry.bind("spf", serverPipelineFactory);
context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
  public void configure() {
      String netty_ssl_endpoint =
         "netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5150?serverPipelineFactory=#spf"
      String return_string =
         "When You Go Home, Tell Them Of Us And Say,"
         + "For Your Tomorrow, We Gave Our Today.";

      from(netty_ssl_endpoint)
       .process(new Processor() {
          public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            exchange.getOut().setBody(return_string);
          }
       }
  }
});
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Reusing Netty boss and worker thread pools

*Available as of Camel 2.12*

Netty has two kind of thread pools: boss and worker. By default each
Netty consumer and producer has their private thread pools. If you want
to reuse these thread pools among multiple consumers or producers then
the thread pools must be created and enlisted in the
Registry.

For example using Spring XML we can create a shared worker thread pool
using the `NettyWorkerPoolBuilder` with 2 worker threads as shown below:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <!-- use the worker pool builder to help create the shared thread pool -->
  <bean id="poolBuilder" class="org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyWorkerPoolBuilder">
    <property name="workerCount" value="2"/>
  </bean>

  <!-- the shared worker thread pool -->
  <bean id="sharedPool" class="org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.WorkerPool"
        factory-bean="poolBuilder" factory-method="build" destroy-method="shutdown">
  </bean>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TIP: For boss thread pool there is a
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyServerBossPoolBuilder` builder
for Netty consumers, and a
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyClientBossPoolBuilder` for the
Netty producers.

Then in the Camel routes we can refer to this worker pools by
configuring the `workerPool` option in the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CAMEL&title=URI&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=14814487[URI]
as shown below:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <route>
      <from uri="netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5021?textline=true&amp;sync=true&amp;workerPool=#sharedPool&amp;orderedThreadPoolExecutor=false"/>
      <to uri="log:result"/>
      ...
    </route>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And if we have another route we can refer to the shared worker pool:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <route>
      <from uri="netty:tcp://0.0.0.0:5022?textline=true&amp;sync=true&amp;workerPool=#sharedPool&amp;orderedThreadPoolExecutor=false"/>
      <to uri="log:result"/>
      ...
    </route>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

... and so forth.
