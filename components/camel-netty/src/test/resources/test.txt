Song Of A Dream
by: Dr Sarojini Naidu

ONCE in the dream of a night I stood 
Lone in the light of a magical wood, 
Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang; 
And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang, 
And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed, 
And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.


Lone in the light of that magical grove, 
I felt the stars of the spirits of Love 
Gather and gleam round my delicate youth, 
And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth; 
To quench my longing I bent me low 
By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.
