The Elytron Security Provider provides Elytron security over camel-undertow component.
It enables camel-undertow component use Elytron security capabilities.
To force camel-undertow to use elytron security provider, add elytron security provider library
on classpath and provide instance of ElytronSercurityConfiguration as `securityConfiguration`
parameter into camel-undertow component or provide both  `securityConfiguration` and `securityProvider`
into camel-undertow component.

Configuration has to provide all 3 security attributes:

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Type
| *domainBuilder* | Builder for security domain. | SecurityDomain.Builder
| *mechanismName* | MechanismName should be selected with regard to default securityRealm. For
example to use bearer_token security, mechanism name has to be `BEARER_TOKEN` and realm has to be `TokenSecurityReal` | String
| *elytronProvider* | Instance of WildFlyElytronBaseProvider with respect of mechanismName | WildFlyElytronBaseProvider
|===
