== file-watch Component

*Available as of Camel version 3.0*

=== URI Options

// component options: START
The file-watch component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resolveProperty Placeholders* (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The file-watch endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
file-watch:path
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *path* | *Required* Path of directory to consume events from. |  | String
|===


==== Query Parameters (14 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *antInclude* (consumer) | ANT style pattern to match files. The file is matched against path relative to endpoint path. Pattern must be also relative (not starting with slash) | ** | String
| *autoCreate* (consumer) | Auto create directory if does not exists. | true | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *concurrentConsumers* (consumer) | The number of concurrent consumers. Increase this value, if your route is slow to prevent buffering in queue. | 1 | int
| *events* (consumer) | Coma separated list of events to watch. Allowed values are: CREATE, MODIFY, DELETE. | CREATE,MODIFY,DELETE | Set
| *fileHasher* (consumer) | Reference to io.methvin.watcher.hashing.FileHasher. This prevents emitting duplicate events on some platforms. For working with large files and if you dont need detect multiple modifications per second per file, use #lastModifiedTimeFileHasher. You can also provide custom implementation in registry. | #murmur3FFileHasher | FileHasher
| *pollThreads* (consumer) | The number of threads polling WatchService. Increase this value, if you see OVERFLOW messages in log. | 1 | int
| *queueSize* (consumer) | Maximum size of queue between WatchService and consumer. Unbounded by default. | 2147483647 | int
| *recursive* (consumer) | Watch recursive in current and child directories (including newly created directories). | true | boolean
| *useFileHashing* (consumer) | Enables or disables file hashing to detect duplicate events. If you disable this, you can get some events multiple times on some platforms and JDKs. Check java.nio.file.WatchService limitations for your target platform. | true | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

=== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-file-watch-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.file-watch.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.file-watch.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the file-watch component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.file-watch.resolve-property-placeholders* | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | Boolean

=== Message Headers

The following headers are supported by this component:

==== File Watch consumer only

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|===
|Header |Description

|`CamelFileName` |Name of the consumed file as a relative file path with offset from the
starting directory configured on the endpoint.

|`CamelFileNameOnly` |Only the file name (the name with no leading paths).

|`CamelFileAbsolute` |A `boolean` option specifying whether the consumed file denotes an
absolute path or not. Should normally be `false` for relative paths.
Absolute paths should normally not be used but we added to the move
option to allow moving files to absolute paths. But can be used
elsewhere as well.

|`CamelFileAbsolutePath` |The absolute path to the file. For relative files this path holds the
relative path instead.

|`CamelFilePath` |The file path. For relative files this is the starting directory + the
relative filename. For absolute files this is the absolute path.

|`CamelFileRelativePath` |The relative path.

|`CamelFileParent` |The parent path.

|`CamelFileLength` |A `long` value containing the file size.

|`CamelFileLastModified` |A `Long` value containing the last modified timestamp of the file. In
*Camel 2.10.3 and older* the type is `Date`.
|===

=== Filtering using ANT path matcher

The file paths is matched with the following rules:

* `?` matches one character
* `*` matches zero or more characters
* `**` matches zero or more directories in a path

TIP: *New options from Camel 2.10 onwards*
There are now `antInclude` and `antExclude` options to make it easy to
specify ANT style include/exclude without having to define the filter.
See the URI options above for more information.

The sample below demonstrates how to use it:

=== Using consumer.bridgeErrorHandler

If you want to use the Camel Error Handler to
deal with any exception occurring in the file consumer, then you can
enable the `consumer.bridgeErrorHandler` option as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// to handle any IOException being thrown
onException(IOException.class)
    .handled(true)
    .log("IOException occurred due: ${exception.message}")
    .transform().simple("Error ${exception.message}")
    .to("mock:error");

// this is the file route that pickup files, notice how we bridge the consumer to use the Camel routing error handler
// the exclusiveReadLockStrategy is only configured because this is from an unit test, so we use that to simulate exceptions
from("file-watch:target/nospace?consumer.bridgeErrorHandler=true")
    .convertBodyTo(String.class)
    .to("mock:result");
----

So all you have to do is to enable this option, and the error handler in
the route will take it from there.

IMPORTANT: *Important when using consumer.bridgeErrorHandler*
When using consumer.bridgeErrorHandler, then
interceptors, OnCompletions
does *not* apply. The Exchange is processed directly
by the Camel Error Handler, and does not allow
prior actions such as interceptors, onCompletion to take action.
