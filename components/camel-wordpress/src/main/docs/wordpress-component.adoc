*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

Camel component for https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/[Wordpress API].

Currently only the **Posts** and **Users** operations are supported.

== Options

// component options: START
The Wordpress component supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apiVersion* (common) | The Wordpress REST API version | 2 | String
| *criteria* (common) | The criteria to use with complex searches. |  | Map
| *force* (common) | Whether to bypass trash and force deletion. | false | boolean
| *id* (common) | The entity ID. Should be passed when the operation performed requires a specific entity, e.g. deleting a post |  | Integer
| *password* (common) | Password from authorized user |  | String
| *searchCriteria* (common) | Search criteria |  | SearchCriteria
| *url* (common) | *Required* The Wordpress API URL from your site, e.g. \http://myblog.com/wp-json/ |  | String
| *user* (common) | Authorized user to perform writing operations |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | *Deprecated* Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Wordpress component configuration |  | WordpressConfiguration
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The Wordpress endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
wordpress:operation
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *operation* | *Required* The endpoint operation. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: post, user |  | String
| *operationDetail* | The second part of an endpoint operation. Needed only when endpoint semantic is not enough, like wordpress:post:delete. There are 1 enums and the value can be one of: delete |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (14 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apiVersion* (common) | The Wordpress REST API version | 2 | String
| *criteria* (common) | The criteria to use with complex searches. |  | Map
| *force* (common) | Whether to bypass trash and force deletion. | false | boolean
| *id* (common) | The entity ID. Should be passed when the operation performed requires a specific entity, e.g. deleting a post |  | Integer

| *url* (common) | *Required* The Wordpress API URL from your site, e.g. \http://myblog.com/wp-json/ |  | String
| *user* (common) | Authorized user to perform writing operations |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END



Most of parameters needed when performing a read operation mirrors from the official https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/[API]. When performing searches operations, the `criteria.` suffix is needed. Take the following `Consumer` as example:

----
wordpress:post?criteria.perPage=10&criteria.orderBy=author&criteria.categories=camel,dozer,json
----

=== Configuring Wordpress component

The `WordpressConfiguration` class can be used to set initial properties configuration to the component instead of passing it as query parameter. The following listing shows how to set the component to be used in your routes.

[source,java]
----
public void configure() {
    final WordpressConfiguration configuration = new WordpressConfiguration();
    final WordpressComponent component = new WordpressComponent();
    configuration.setApiVersion("2");
    configuration.setUrl("http://yoursite.com/wp-json/");
    component.setConfiguration(configuration);
    getContext().addComponent("wordpress", component);

    from("wordpress:post?id=1")
      .to("mock:result");
}
----

=== Consumer Example

Consumer polls from the API from time to time domain objects from Wordpress. Following, an example using the `Post` operation:

- `wordpress:post` retrieves posts (defaults to 10 posts)    
- `wordpress:post?id=1` search for a specific post

=== Producer Example

Producer performs write operations on Wordpress like adding a new user or update a post. To be able to write, you must have an authorized user credentials (see Authentication). 

- `wordpress:post` creates a new post from the `org.apache.camel.component.wordpress.api.model.Post` class in the message body.  
- `wordpress:post?id=1` updates a post based on data `org.apache.camel.component.wordpress.api.model.Post` from the message body.  
- `wordpress:post:delete?id=1` deletes a specific post

== Authentication

Producers that perform write operations (e.g. create a new post) https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/[must have an authenticated user] to do so. The standard authentication mechanism used by Wordpress is cookie. Unfortunately this method is not supported outside Wordpress environment because it's rely on https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces[nonce] internal function.

There's some alternatives to use the Wordpress API without nonces, but requires specific plugin installations.

At this time, `camel-wordpress` only supports Basic Authentication (more to come). To configure it, you must install the https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth[Basic-Auth Wordpress plugin] and pass the credentials to the endpoint:

`from("direct:deletePost").to("wordpress:post:delete?id=9&user=ben&password=password123").to("mock:resultDelete");`

**It's not recommend to use Basic Authentication in production without TLS!!**
