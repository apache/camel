= JSLT Component

*Since Camel 3.1*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Jslt component allows you to process a JSON messages using an
https://github.com/schibsted/jslt[JSLT] expression. This can be
ideal when doing JSON to JSON transformation or querying data.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to
their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jslt</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

 

== URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------
jslt:specName[?options]
-----------------------

Where *specName* is the classpath-local URI of the specification to
invoke; or the complete URL of the remote specification
(eg: \file://folder/myfile.vm).

You can append query options to the URI in the following
format, `?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options




// component options: START
The JSLT component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *functions* (advanced) | JSLT can be extended by plugging in functions written in Java. |  | Collection
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END






// endpoint options: START
The JSLT endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
jslt:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* Path to the resource. You can prefix with: classpath, file, http, ref, or bean. classpath, file and http loads the resource using these protocols (classpath is default). ref will lookup the resource in the registry. bean will call a method on a bean to be used as the resource. For bean you can specify the method name after dot, eg bean:myBean.myMethod. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (5 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *prettyPrint* (common) | If true, JSON in output message is pretty printed. | false | boolean
| *contentCache* (producer) | Sets whether to use resource content cache or not | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-jslt-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.jslt.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.jslt.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.jslt.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the jolt component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.jslt.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.jslt.transform* | Explicitly sets the Transform to use. If not set a Transform specified by the transformDsl will be created. The option is a com.bazaarvoice.jolt.Transform type. |  | String
|===
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: END




== Samples

For example you could use something like

[source,java]
--------------------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("jslt:com/acme/MyResponse.json");
--------------------------------------

And a file based resource:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("jslt:file://myfolder/MyResponse.json?contentCache=true").
  to("activemq:Another.Queue");
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can also specify which JSLT expression the component should use
dynamically via a header, so for example:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in").
  setHeader("CamelJsltResourceUri").constant("path/to/my/spec.json").
  to("jslt:dummy");
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Or send whole jslt expression via header: (suitable for querying)
 
[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in").
  setHeader("CamelJsltResourceUri").constant(".published").
  to("jslt:dummy");
---------------------------------------------------------------------
