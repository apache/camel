/**
 * A shutdown hook that can be used to shutdown {@link CamelContext} before the
 * ActiveMQ broker is shut down. This is sometimes important as if the broker is
 * shutdown before Camel there could be a loss of data due to inflight exchanges
 * not yet completed.
 * <p>
 * This hook can be added to ActiveMQ configuration ({@code activemq.xml}) as in
 * the following example:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;bean xmlns=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot; class=&quot;org.apache.activemq.camel.CamelShutdownHook&quot; /&gt;
