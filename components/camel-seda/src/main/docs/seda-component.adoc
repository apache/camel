*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The SEDA component provides asynchronous
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture[SEDA] behavior, so that
messages are exchanged on a
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html[BlockingQueue]
and consumers are invoked in a separate thread from the producer.

Note that queues are only visible within a _single_
CamelContext. If you want to communicate across
`CamelContext` instances (for example, communicating between Web
applications), see the xref:vm-component.adoc[VM] component.

This component does not implement any kind of persistence or recovery,
if the VM terminates while messages are yet to be processed. If you need
persistence, reliability or distributed SEDA, try using either
xref:jms-component.adoc[JMS] or xref:jms-component.adoc[ActiveMQ].

[TIP]
====
*Synchronous*

The xref:direct-component.adoc[Direct] component provides synchronous invocation
of any consumers when a producer sends a message exchange.

== URI format

----
seda:someName[?options]
----

Where *someName* can be any string that uniquely identifies the endpoint
within the current CamelContext.


// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END



== Choosing BlockingQueue implementation

By default, the SEDA component always intantiates LinkedBlockingQueue,
but you can use different implementation, you can reference your own
BlockingQueue implementation, in this case the size option is not used

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="arrayQueue" class="java.util.ArrayBlockingQueue">
  <constructor-arg index="0" value="10" ><!-- size -->
  <constructor-arg index="1" value="true" ><!-- fairness -->
</bean>

<!-- ... and later -->
<from>seda:array?queue=#arrayQueue</from>
----

Or you can reference a BlockingQueueFactory implementation, 3
implementations are provided LinkedBlockingQueueFactory,
ArrayBlockingQueueFactory and PriorityBlockingQueueFactory:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="priorityQueueFactory" class="org.apache.camel.component.seda.PriorityBlockingQueueFactory">
  <property name="comparator">
    <bean class="org.apache.camel.demo.MyExchangeComparator" />
  </property>
</bean>

<!-- ... and later -->
<from>seda:priority?queueFactory=#priorityQueueFactory&size=100</from>
----

== Use of Request Reply

The xref:seda-component.adoc[SEDA] component supports using
Request Reply, where the caller will wait for
the Async route to complete. For instance:

[source,java]
----
from("mina:tcp://0.0.0.0:9876?textline=true&sync=true").to("seda:input");

from("seda:input").to("bean:processInput").to("bean:createResponse");
----

In the route above, we have a TCP listener on port 9876 that accepts
incoming requests. The request is routed to the `seda:input` queue. As
it is a Request Reply message, we wait for the
response. When the consumer on the `seda:input` queue is complete, it
copies the response to the original message response.

== Concurrent consumers

By default, the SEDA endpoint uses a single consumer thread, but you can
configure it to use concurrent consumer threads. So instead of thread
pools you can use:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:stageName?concurrentConsumers=5").process(...)
----

As for the difference between the two, note a _thread pool_ can
increase/shrink dynamically at runtime depending on load, whereas the
number of concurrent consumers is always fixed.

== Thread pools

Be aware that adding a thread pool to a SEDA endpoint by doing something
like:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:stageName").thread(5).process(...)
----

Can wind up with two `BlockQueues`: one from the SEDA endpoint, and one
from the workqueue of the thread pool, which may not be what you want.
Instead, you might wish to configure a xref:direct-component.adoc[Direct] endpoint
with a thread pool, which can process messages both synchronously and
asynchronously. For example:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:stageName").thread(5).process(...)
----

You can also directly configure number of threads that process messages
on a SEDA endpoint using the `concurrentConsumers` option.

== Sample

In the route below we use the SEDA queue to send the request to this
async queue to be able to send a fire-and-forget message for further
processing in another thread, and return a constant reply in this thread
to the original caller.

We send a Hello World message and expects the reply to be OK.

[source,java]
----
    @Test
    public void testSendAsync() throws Exception {
        MockEndpoint mock = getMockEndpoint("mock:result");
        mock.expectedBodiesReceived("Hello World");

        // START SNIPPET: e2
        Object out = template.requestBody("direct:start", "Hello World");
        assertEquals("OK", out);
        // END SNIPPET: e2

        MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(context);
    }

    @Override
    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            // START SNIPPET: e1
            public void configure() throws Exception {
                from("direct:start")
                    // send it to the seda queue that is async
                    .to("seda:next")
                    // return a constant response
                    .transform(constant("OK"));

                from("seda:next").to("mock:result");
            }
            // END SNIPPET: e1
        };
    }
----


The "Hello World" message will be consumed from the SEDA queue from
another thread for further processing. Since this is from a unit test,
it will be sent to a `mock` endpoint where we can do assertions in the
unit test.

== Using multipleConsumers

In this example we have defined two consumers.

[source,java]
----
    @Test
    public void testSameOptionsProducerStillOkay() throws Exception {
        getMockEndpoint("mock:foo").expectedBodiesReceived("Hello World");
        getMockEndpoint("mock:bar").expectedBodiesReceived("Hello World");

        template.sendBody("seda:foo", "Hello World");

        MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(context);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() throws Exception {
                from("seda:foo?multipleConsumers=true").routeId("foo").to("mock:foo");
                from("seda:foo?multipleConsumers=true").routeId("bar").to("mock:bar");
            }
        };
    }
----


Since we have specified *multipleConsumers=true* on the seda foo
endpoint we can have those two consumers receive their own copy of the
message as a kind of pub-sub style messaging.

As the beans are part of an unit test they simply send the message to a
mock endpoint.

== Extracting queue information.

If needed, information such as queue size, etc. can be obtained without
using JMX in this fashion:

[source,java]
----
SedaEndpoint seda = context.getEndpoint("seda:xxxx");
int size = seda.getExchanges().size();
----
