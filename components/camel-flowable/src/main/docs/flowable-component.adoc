=== Body content

The body content is defined by the event model that is deployed to the Flowable Event Registry.
The event message can then be mapped to process or case variables in the process BPMN or case CMMN model.

== Examples

The following example sends an event to the Flowable event registry for further processing:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start").to("flowable:exampleChannel");
----------------------------------------------------------------------

== Dependencies

To use Flowable in your Camel routes, you need to add a dependency on
*camel-flowable*, which implements the component.

If you use Maven, you can add the following to your pom.xml,
substituting the version number for the latest and greatest release (see
the download page for the latest versions).
