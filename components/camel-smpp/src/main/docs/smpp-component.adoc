*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

This component provides access to an SMSC (Short Message Service Center)
over the http://smsforum.net/SMPP_v3_4_Issue1_2.zip[SMPP] protocol to
send and receive SMS. The http://jsmpp.org[JSMPP] library is used for
the protocol implementation.

The version of the SMPP protocol specification is 3.4 by default and can be set using the component configuration options (field "interfaceVersion").

The Camel component currently operates as an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESME[ESME] (External Short Messaging
Entity) and not as an SMSC itself.

You are also able to execute `ReplaceSm`,
`QuerySm`, `SubmitMulti`, `CancelSm`, and `DataSm`.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-smpp</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== SMS limitations

SMS is neither reliable nor secure. Users who require reliable and
secure delivery may want to consider using the XMPP or SIP components
instead, combined with a smartphone app supporting the chosen protocol.

* Reliability: although the SMPP standard offers a range of feedback
mechanisms to indicate errors, non-delivery and confirmation of delivery,
it is not uncommon for mobile networks to hide or simulate these
responses.  For example, some networks automatically send a delivery
confirmation for every message even if the destination number is invalid
or not switched on.  Some networks silently drop messages if they think
they are spam.  Spam detection rules in the network may be very crude,
sometimes more than 100 messages per day from a single sender may be
considered spam.
* Security: there is basic encryption for the last hop from the radio
tower down to the recipient handset.  SMS messages are not encrypted or
authenticated in any other part of the network.  Some operators allow
staff in retail outlets or call centres to browse through the SMS
message histories of their customers.  Message sender identity can be
easily forged.  Regulators and even the mobile telephone industry itself
 have cautioned against the use of SMS in two-factor authentication
schemes and other purposes where security is important.

While the Camel component makes it as easy as possible to send messages
to the SMS network, it cannot offer an easy solution to these problems.

== Data coding, alphabet and international character sets

Data coding and alphabet can be specified on a per-message basis. 
Default values can be specified for the endpoint.  It is important to
understand the relationship between these options and the way the
component acts when more than one value is set.

Data coding is an 8 bit field in the SMPP wire format.

The alphabet corresponds to bits 0–3 of the data coding field.
For some types of message, where a message class is used (by setting bit 5 of the
data coding field), the lower two bits of the data coding field are not
interpreted as alphabet.
Only bits 2 and 3 impact the alphabet.

Furthermore, the current version of the JSMPP library only seems to support
bits 2 and 3, assuming that bits 0 and 1 are used for message class. 
This is why the Alphabet class in JSMPP doesn't support the value 3
(binary 0011) which indicates ISO-8859-1.

Although JSMPP provides a representation of the message class parameter,
the Camel component doesn't currently provide a way to set it other than
manually setting the corresponding bits in the data coding field.

When setting the data coding field in the outgoing message, the Camel
component considers the following values and uses the first one it can
find:

* the data coding specified in a header
* the alphabet specified in a header
* the data coding specified in the endpoint configuration (URI
parameter)

In addition to trying to send the data coding value to the SMSC, the
Camel component also tries to analyze the message body, converts it to a
Java String (Unicode) and converts that to a byte array in the
corresponding alphabet. When deciding which alphabet to use in the byte
array, the Camel SMPP component does not consider the data coding value
(header or configuration), it only considers the specified alphabet
(from either the header or endpoint parameter).

If some characters in the String cannot be represented in the chosen
alphabet, they may be replaced by the question mark (`?`) symbol.
Users of the API may want to consider checking if their message body can be
converted to ISO-8859-1 before passing it to the component and if not,
setting the alphabet header to request UCS-2 encoding.
If the alphabet
and data coding options are not specified at all, then the component may
try to detect the required encoding and set the data coding for you.

The list of alphabet codes is specified in the SMPP specification v3.4,
section 5.2.19.  One notable limitation of the SMPP specification is
that there is no alphabet code for explicitly requesting use of the GSM
3.38 (7-bit) character set.  Choosing `0` for the alphabet
selects the SMSC _default_ alphabet, this usually means GSM 3.38, but it
is not guaranteed.  The SMPP gateway Nexmo
https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204015813-How-to-change-the-character-encoding-in-SMPP-[actually
allows the default to be mapped to any other character set with a
control panel option]. It is suggested that users check with their SMSC
operator to confirm exactly which character set is being used as the
default.

== Message splitting and throttling

After transforming a message body from a String to a byte array, the
Camel component is also responsible for splitting the message into parts
(within the 140 byte SMS size limit) before passing it to JSMPP.  This
is completed automatically.

If the GSM 3.38 alphabet is used, the component will pack up to 160
characters into the 140-byte message body.
If an 8-bit character set is used (e.g., ISO-8859-1 for Western Europe), then 140 characters will be
allowed within the 140-byte message body.
If 16 bit UCS-2 encoding is
 used, then just 70 characters fit into each 140-byte message.

Some SMSC providers implement throttling rules.  Each part of a message
that has been split may be counted separately by the provider's
throttling mechanism.  The Camel Throttler component can be useful for
throttling messages in the SMPP route before handing them to the SMSC.

== URI format

--------------------------------------------
smpp://[username@]hostname[:port][?options]
smpps://[username@]hostname[:port][?options]
--------------------------------------------

If no *username* is provided, then Camel will provide the default value
`smppclient`. +
 If no *port* number is provided, then Camel will provide the default
value `2775`. +
If the protocol name is "smpps", camel-smpp with try to
use SSLSocket to init a connection to the server.

== Exception handling

This component supports the general Camel exception handling
capabilities

When an error occurs sending a message with SubmitSm (the default
action), the org.apache.camel.component.smpp.SmppException is thrown
with a nested exception, org.jsmpp.extra.NegativeResponseException. 
Call NegativeResponseException.getCommandStatus() to obtain the exact
SMPP negative response code, the values are explained in the SMPP
specification 3.4, section 5.1.3. +
When the SMPP consumer receives a `DeliverSm` or
`DataSm` short message and the processing of these messages fails, you
can also throw a `ProcessRequestException` instead of handle the
failure. In this case, this exception is forwarded to the underlying
http://jsmpp.org[JSMPP library] which will return the included error
code to the SMSC. This feature is useful to e.g., instruct the SMSC to
resend the short message at a later time. This could be done with the
following lines of code:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("smpp://smppclient@localhost:2775?password=password&enquireLinkTimer=3000&transactionTimer=5000&systemType=consumer")
  .doTry()
    .to("bean:dao?method=updateSmsState")
  .doCatch(Exception.class)
    .throwException(new ProcessRequestException("update of sms state failed", 100))
  .end();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please refer to the http://smsforum.net/SMPP_v3_4_Issue1_2.zip[SMPP
specification] for the complete list of error codes and their meanings.

== Samples

A route which sends an SMS using the Java DSL:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .to("smpp://smppclient@localhost:2775?
      password=password&enquireLinkTimer=3000&transactionTimer=5000&systemType=producer");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A route which sends an SMS using the Spring XML DSL:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="smpp://smppclient@localhost:2775?
           password=password&amp;enquireLinkTimer=3000&amp;transactionTimer=5000&amp;systemType=producer"/>
</route>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A route which receives an SMS using the Java DSL:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("smpp://smppclient@localhost:2775?password=password&enquireLinkTimer=3000&transactionTimer=5000&systemType=consumer")
  .to("bean:foo");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A route which receives an SMS using the Spring XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <route>
     <from uri="smpp://smppclient@localhost:2775?
                password=password&amp;enquireLinkTimer=3000&amp;transactionTimer=5000&amp;systemType=consumer"/>
     <to uri="bean:foo"/>
  </route>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of using transceiver (TRX) binding type:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
        .to("smpp://j@localhost:8056?password=jpwd&systemType=producer" +
            "&messageReceiverRouteId=sampleMessageReceiverRouteId");

from("direct:messageReceiver").id("sampleMessageReceiverRouteId")
        .to("bean:foo");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that with TRX binding type, you wouldn't define a corresponding redundant SMPP consumer. Camel will use the
specified route by `messageReceiverRouteId` as the corresponding consumer. Internally, it uses one and same SmppSession
as producer for the provided consumer.

When the SMPP Server doesn't support TRX,
then you have to define separate producer (TX by default) and consumer (RX by default).
