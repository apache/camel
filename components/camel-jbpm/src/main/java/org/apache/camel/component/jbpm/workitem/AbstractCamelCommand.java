/**
 * Camel jBPM {@link Command} which allows to call Camel routes with a <code>direct</code> endpoint.
 * <p/>
 * The command passes the {@WorkItem} retrieved from the {@link CommandContext} to the route that has a consumer on the endpoint-id 
 * that can be passed with the <code>camel-endpoint-id</code> {@link WorkItem} parameter. E.g. when a the value "myCamelEndpoint" is passed to the 
 * {link WorkItem} via the <code>camel-endpoint-id</code> parameter, this {@link Command} will send the {@link WorkItem} to 
 * the Camel URI <code>direct:myCamelEndpoint</code>.  
 * <p/>
 * The body of the result {@link Message} of the invocation is returned via the <code>Response</code> parameter. Access to the raw response 
 * {@link Message} is provided via the <code>Message</code> parameter. This gives the user access to more advanced fields like message headers 
 * and attachments.
