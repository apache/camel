[[jbpm-component]]
== JBPM Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.6*

The *jbpm* component provides integration with Business Process
Management http://www.jbpm.org/[jBPM]. It uses
kie-server-client API to interact with jBPM instance over REST. The
component supports both producer and consumer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jbpm</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version><!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Consumer

jBPM Consumer allows to attach routes to 

* ProcessEventListeners
* TaskEventListners
* CaseEventListeners

### URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------
jbpm::events:type:[classifier][?options]
---------------------------------------------

==== Path Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *events* | Classifier for the consumer to know which type of data it should attach to |  | URL
| *type* | Type of event listener - supports: process, task, case |  | String
| *classifier* | Used to distinguish routes for same event type|  | String
|===

Each route would then receive events when they are being produced by jBPM engine.

Routes can be defined either in global way - on application level or deployed 
together with business assets projects also knows as KJARs.

Consumers are configured via KieServerExtension that is a pluggable interface to enhance
jBPM with additional capabilities. It reacts to different life cycle phases of the KIE Server
and by that is able to configure individual endpoints properly.

### KJAR routes

Create file named `camel-routes.xml` in the root folder of your KJAR (src/main/resources) so it will be automatically 
discovered and Camel Context for given KJAR will be created.

### Global routes

Create file name `global-camel-routes` in the root of the class path of KIE Server. It will be automatically found and registered
on every KJAR deployed to KIE Server.


Example camel-routes.xml file that can be placed in the KJAR

[source, xml]
----
<routes xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    
    <route id="processes">
        <from uri="jbpm:events:process:test"/>
        <filter>
          <simple>${in.header.EventType} == 'beforeProcessStarted'</simple>
          <to uri="log:kjar.processes?level=INFO&amp;showBody=true&amp;showHeaders=true"/>
        </filter>
    </route>
    
    <route id="tasks">
        <from uri="jbpm:events:task:test"/>
        <filter>
          <simple>${in.header.EventType} starts with 'before'</simple>
          <to uri="log:kjar.tasks?level=INFO&amp;showBody=true&amp;showHeaders=true"/>
        </filter>
    </route>
</routes>

### Use of jBPM Component in KIE Server

To make use of camel-jbpm component in a KIE Server it is as simple as just adding two jars into KIE Server application

* camel-core
* camel-jbpm

then start KIE Server and you will see once booted following information in logs

[source, plain]
----
Camel KIE Server extension has been successfully registered as server extension
....

Route: tasks started and consuming from: jbpm://events:task:test?deploymentId=form-rendering_1.0.0
Total 2 routes, of which 2 are started
Apache Camel 2.23.0-SNAPSHOT (CamelContext: KIE Server Camel context for container evaluation_1.0.0) started in 0.378 seconds
o.k.server.services.impl.KieServerImpl   : Container evaluation_1.0.0 (for release id evaluation:evaluation:1.0.0) successfully started
----

To make use of jBPM Consumer jBPM deployment descriptor must also define camel specific event listeners of following types

* `new org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.listeners.CamelProcessEventListener()`
* `new org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.listeners.CamelTaskEventListener()`
* `new org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.listeners.CamelCaseEventListener()`

These must be set in either server level of kjar deployment descriptor (use MVEL as resolver type) - see jbpm docs for more details about
deployment descriptors.

## Producer

Producer is dedicated to interact with jBPM via kie-server-client that uses exposed REST api of 
jBPM (KIE Server).

### URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------
jbpm::hostName[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
---------------------------------------------

### URI Options


// component options: START
The JBPM component has no options.
// component options: END





// endpoint options: START
The JBPM endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
jbpm:connectionURL
----

### Example

Below is an example route that starts a business process with id
evaluation. To run this example you need jBPM to run locally, easiest is to use single zip 
distribution - downloaded from jbpm.org. Next, start it and import Evaluation sample project, build and deploy.
Once done this test can be ran out of the box.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();
params.put("employee", "wbadmin");
params.put("reason", "Camel asks for it");

from("direct:start")
        .setHeader(JBPMConstants.PROCESS_ID, constant("evaluation"))
        .setHeader((JBPMConstants.PARAMETERS, params))
        .to("jbpm:http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server?userName=wbadmin&password=wbadmin
        &deploymentId=evaluation");
