## JBPM Component

*Available as of Camel 2.16*

The *jbpm* component provides integration with Business Process
Management (BPM) Suit http://www.jbpm.org/[jBPM]. It uses
kie-remote-client API to interact with jBPM instance over REST. The
component supports only producer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jbpm</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version><!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
