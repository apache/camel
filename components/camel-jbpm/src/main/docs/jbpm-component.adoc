= JBPM Component

*Since Camel 2.6*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The JBPM component provides integration with Business Process
Management http://www.jbpm.org/[jBPM]. It uses
kie-server-client API to interact with jBPM instance over REST. The
component supports both producer and consumer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jbpm</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version><!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Consumer

jBPM Consumer allows to attach routes to 

* ProcessEventListeners
* TaskEventListners
* CaseEventListeners

== URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------
jbpm::events:type:[classifier][?options]
---------------------------------------------

=== Path Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *events* | Classifier for the consumer to know which type of data it should attach to |  | URL
| *type* | Type of event listener - supports: process, task, case |  | String
| *classifier* | Used to distinguish routes for same event type|  | String
|===

Each route would then receive events when they are being produced by jBPM engine.

Routes can be defined either in global way - on application level or deployed 
together with business assets projects also knows as KJARs.

Consumers are configured via KieServerExtension that is a pluggable interface to enhance
jBPM with additional capabilities. It reacts to different life cycle phases of the KIE Server
and by that is able to configure individual endpoints properly.

== KJAR routes

Create file named `camel-routes.xml` in the root folder of your KJAR (src/main/resources) so it will be automatically 
discovered and Camel Context for given KJAR will be created.

== Global routes

Create file name `global-camel-routes` in the root of the class path of KIE Server. It will be automatically found and registered
on every KJAR deployed to KIE Server.


Example camel-routes.xml file that can be placed in the KJAR

[source, xml]
----
<routes xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    
    <route id="processes">
        <from uri="jbpm:events:process:test"/>
        <filter>
          <simple>${in.header.EventType} == 'beforeProcessStarted'</simple>
          <to uri="log:kjar.processes?level=INFO&amp;showBody=true&amp;showHeaders=true"/>
        </filter>
    </route>
    
    <route id="tasks">
        <from uri="jbpm:events:task:test"/>
        <filter>
          <simple>${in.header.EventType} starts with 'before'</simple>
          <to uri="log:kjar.tasks?level=INFO&amp;showBody=true&amp;showHeaders=true"/>
        </filter>
    </route>
</routes>

== Use of jBPM Component in KIE Server

To make use of camel-jbpm component in a KIE Server it is as simple as just adding two jars into KIE Server application

* camel-core
* camel-jbpm

then start KIE Server and you will see once booted following information in logs

[source, plain]
----
Camel KIE Server extension has been successfully registered as server extension
....

Route: tasks started and consuming from: jbpm://events:task:test?deploymentId=form-rendering_1.0.0
Total 2 routes, of which 2 are started
Apache Camel 2.23.0-SNAPSHOT (CamelContext: KIE Server Camel context for container evaluation_1.0.0) started in 0.378 seconds
o.k.server.services.impl.KieServerImpl   : Container evaluation_1.0.0 (for release id evaluation:evaluation:1.0.0) successfully started
----

To make use of jBPM Consumer jBPM deployment descriptor must also define camel specific event listeners of following types

* `new org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.listeners.CamelProcessEventListener()`
* `new org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.listeners.CamelTaskEventListener()`
* `new org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.listeners.CamelCaseEventListener()`

These must be set in either server level of kjar deployment descriptor (use MVEL as resolver type) - see jbpm docs for more details about
deployment descriptors.

== Producer

Producer is dedicated to interact with jBPM via kie-server-client that uses exposed REST api of 
jBPM (KIE Server).

== URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------
jbpm::hostName[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
---------------------------------------------

== URI Options


// component options: START
The JBPM component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END





// endpoint options: START

== Example

Below is an example route that starts a business process with id
evaluation. To run this example you need jBPM to run locally, easiest is to use single zip 
distribution - downloaded from jbpm.org. Next, start it and import Evaluation sample project, build and deploy.
Once done this test can be ran out of the box.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();
params.put("employee", "wbadmin");
params.put("reason", "Camel asks for it");

from("direct:start")
        .setHeader(JBPMConstants.PROCESS_ID, constant("evaluation"))
        .setHeader((JBPMConstants.PARAMETERS, params))
        .to("jbpm:http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server?userName=wbadmin&password=wbadmin
        &deploymentId=evaluation");
