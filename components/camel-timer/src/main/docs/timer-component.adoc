*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Timer component is used to generate message exchanges when a
timer fires. You can only consume events from this endpoint.

== URI format

----
timer:name[?options]
----

Where `name` is the name of the `Timer` object, which is created and
shared across endpoints. So if you use the same name for all your timer
endpoints, only one `Timer` object and thread will be used.

*Note:* The IN body of the generated exchange is `null`. So
`exchange.getIn().getBody()` returns `null`.

[TIP]
====
*Advanced Scheduler*

See also the xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component that supports much more
advanced scheduling.

== Exchange Properties

When the timer is fired, it adds the following information as properties
to the `Exchange`:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|`Exchange.TIMER_NAME` |`String` |The value of the `name` option.

|`Exchange.TIMER_TIME` |`Date` |The value of the `time` option.

|`Exchange.TIMER_PERIOD` |`long` |The value of the `period` option.

|`Exchange.TIMER_FIRED_TIME` |`Date` |The time when the consumer fired.

|`Exchange.TIMER_COUNTER` |`Long` |The current fire counter. Starts from 1.
|===

== Sample

To set up a route that generates an event every 60 seconds:

[source,java]
----
from("timer://foo?fixedRate=true&period=60000").to("bean:myBean?method=someMethodName");
----

The above route will generate an event and then invoke the
`someMethodName` method on the bean called `myBean` in the
Registry.

And the route in Spring DSL:

[source,xml]
-----
<route>
  <from uri="timer://foo?fixedRate=true&amp;period=60000"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean?method=someMethodName"/>
</route>
-----

== Firing as soon as possible

*Since Camel 2.17*

You may want to fire messages in a Camel route as soon as possible you
can use a negative delay:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="timer://foo?delay=-1"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean?method=someMethodName"/>
</route>
----

In this way the timer will fire messages immediately.

You can also specify a `repeatCount` parameter in conjunction with a
negative delay to stop firing messages after a fixed number has been
reached.

If you don't specify a `repeatCount` then the timer will continue firing
messages until the route will be stopped. 

== Firing only once

You may want to fire a message in a Camel route only once, such as when
starting the route. To do that you use the `repeatCount` option as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="timer://foo?repeatCount=1"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean?method=someMethodName"/>
</route>
----
