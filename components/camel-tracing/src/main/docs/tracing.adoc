*Since Camel {since}*

This module is a common interface and API for distributed tracing.

This module is not intended to be used by end users. Instead, you should use one of:

* xref:opentelemetry.adoc[`camel-opentelemetry`]
* xref:observation.adoc[`camel-observation`]

== MDC logging

Mapped Diagnostic Context logging *trace_id* and *span_id* are included when you're setting the MDC configuration `camel.main.use-mdc-logging = true`. However this is a **deprecated** feature that may disappear in future version of the project. The feature can be enabled using the specific tracing/telemetry framework SDK. See more detail on the tracing component documentation page you're using.
