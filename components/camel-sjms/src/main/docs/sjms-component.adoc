= Simple JMS Component

*Since Camel 2.11*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Simple JMS Component, or SJMS, is a JMS client for use with Camel
that uses well known best practices when it comes to JMS client creation
and configuration. SJMS contains a brand new JMS client API written
explicitly for Camel eliminating third party messaging implementations
keeping it light and resilient. The following features is included:

* Standard Queue and Topic Support (Durable & Non-Durable)
* InOnly & InOut MEP Support
* Asynchronous Producer and Consumer Processing
* Internal JMS Transaction Support

Additional key features include:

* Plugable Connection Resource Management
* Session, Consumer, & Producer Pooling & Caching Management
* Batch Consumers
* Transacted Batch Consumers
* Support for Customizable Transaction Commit Strategies (Local JMS
Transactions only)

[NOTE]
====
*Why the S in SJMS*

S stands for Simple and Standard and Springless. Also camel-jms was
already taken.
====

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-sjms</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

== URI format

[source,text]
----
sjms:[queue:|topic:]destinationName[?options]
----

Where `destinationName` is a JMS queue or topic name. By default, the
`destinationName` is interpreted as a queue name. For example, to
connect to the queue, `FOO.BAR` use:

[source,text]
----
sjms:FOO.BAR
----

You can include the optional `queue:` prefix, if you prefer:

[source,text]
----
sjms:queue:FOO.BAR
----

To connect to a topic, you _must_ include the `topic:` prefix. For
example, to connect to the topic, `Stocks.Prices`, use:

[source,text]
----
sjms:topic:Stocks.Prices
----

You append query options to the URI using the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Component Options and Configurations

// component options: START
The Simple JMS component supports 19 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *connectionCount* (common) | The maximum number of connections available to endpoints started under this component | 1 | Integer
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *reconnectBackOff* (consumer) | Backoff in millis on consumer pool reconnection attempts | 5000 | long
| *reconnectOnError* (consumer) | Try to apply reconnection logic on consumer pool | true | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *connectionClientId* (advanced) | The client ID to use when creating javax.jms.Connection when using the default org.apache.camel.component.sjms.jms.ConnectionFactoryResource. |  | String
| *connectionFactory* (advanced) | A ConnectionFactory is required to enable the SjmsComponent. It can be set directly or set set as part of a ConnectionResource. |  | ConnectionFactory
| *connectionMaxWait* (advanced) | The max wait time in millis to block and wait on free connection when the pool is exhausted when using the default org.apache.camel.component.sjms.jms.ConnectionFactoryResource. | 5000 | long
| *connectionResource* (advanced) | A ConnectionResource is an interface that allows for customization and container control of the ConnectionFactory. See Plugable Connection Resource Management for further details. |  | ConnectionResource
| *connectionTestOnBorrow* (advanced) | When using the default org.apache.camel.component.sjms.jms.ConnectionFactoryResource then should each javax.jms.Connection be tested (calling start) before returned from the pool. | true | boolean
| *destinationCreationStrategy* (advanced) | To use a custom DestinationCreationStrategy. |  | DestinationCreationStrategy
| *jmsKeyFormatStrategy* (advanced) | Pluggable strategy for encoding and decoding JMS keys so they can be compliant with the JMS specification. Camel provides one implementation out of the box: default. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens (. and -). Can be used for JMS brokers which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters. You can provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy and refer to it using the # notation. |  | JmsKeyFormatStrategy
| *messageCreatedStrategy* (advanced) | To use the given MessageCreatedStrategy which are invoked when Camel creates new instances of javax.jms.Message objects when Camel is sending a JMS message. |  | MessageCreatedStrategy
| *timedTaskManager* (advanced) | To use a custom TimedTaskManager |  | TimedTaskManager
| *headerFilterStrategy* (filter) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy

| *asyncStartListener* (advanced) | Whether to startup the consumer message listener asynchronously, when starting a route. For example if a JmsConsumer cannot get a connection to a remote JMS broker, then it may block while retrying and/or failover. This will cause Camel to block while starting routes. By setting this option to true, you will let routes startup, while the JmsConsumer connects to the JMS broker using a dedicated thread in asynchronous mode. If this option is used, then beware that if the connection could not be established, then an exception is logged at WARN level, and the consumer will not be able to receive messages; You can then restart the route to retry. | false | boolean
| *asyncStopListener* (advanced) | Whether to stop the consumer message listener asynchronously, when stopping a route. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

Camel provides two implementations out of the box: default and passthrough. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens (. and -). The passthrough strategy leaves the key as is. Can be used for JMS brokers which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters. You can provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy and refer to it using the # notation. |  | JmsKeyFormatStrategy
| *mapJmsMessage* (advanced) | Specifies whether Camel should auto map the received JMS message to a suited payload type, such as javax.jms.TextMessage to a String etc. See section about how mapping works below for more details. | true | boolean

|===
// endpoint options: END


Below is an example of how to configure the `SjmsComponent` with its
required `ConnectionFactory` provider. It will create a single connection
by default and store it using the components internal pooling APIs to
ensure that it is able to service Session creation requests in a thread
safe manner.

[source,java]
----
SjmsComponent component = new SjmsComponent();
component.setConnectionFactory(new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616"));
getContext().addComponent("sjms", component);
----

For a SJMS component that is required to support a durable subscription,
you can override the default `ConnectionFactoryResource` instance and set
the `clientId` property.

[source,java]
----
ConnectionFactoryResource connectionResource = new ConnectionFactoryResource();
connectionResource.setConnectionFactory(new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616"));
connectionResource.setClientId("myclient-id");

SjmsComponent component = new SjmsComponent();
component.setConnectionResource(connectionResource);
component.setMaxConnections(1);
----

== Producer Usage

=== InOnly Producer - (Default)

The _InOnly_ producer is the default behavior of the SJMS Producer
Endpoint.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("sjms:queue:bar");
----

=== InOut Producer

To enable _InOut_ behavior append the `exchangePattern` attribute to the
URI. By default it will use a dedicated TemporaryQueue for each
consumer.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("sjms:queue:bar?exchangePattern=InOut");
----

You can specify a `namedReplyTo` though which can provide a better
monitor point.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("sjms:queue:bar?exchangePattern=InOut&namedReplyTo=my.reply.to.queue");
----

== Consumer Usage

=== InOnly Consumer - (Default)

The _InOnly_ consumer is the default Exchange behavior of the SJMS
Consumer Endpoint.

[source,java]
----
from("sjms:queue:bar")
    .to("mock:result");
----

=== InOut Consumer

To enable _InOut_ behavior append the `exchangePattern` attribute to the
URI.

[source,java]
----
from("sjms:queue:in.out.test?exchangePattern=InOut")
    .transform(constant("Bye Camel"));
----

== Advanced Usage Notes

=== Plugable Connection Resource Management [[SJMS-connectionresource]]

SJMS provides JMS `Connection`
resource management through built-in connection pooling. This eliminates
the need to depend on third party API pooling logic. However there may
be times that you are required to use an external Connection resource
manager such as those provided by J2EE or OSGi containers. For this SJMS
provides an interface that can be used to override the internal SJMS
Connection pooling capabilities. This is accomplished through the `ConnectionResource` interface.

The `ConnectionResource`
provides methods for borrowing and returning Connections as needed is
the contract used to provide `Connection`
pools to the SJMS component. A user should use when it is necessary to
integrate SJMS with an external connection pooling manager.

It is recommended though that for standard JMS `ConnectionFactory`
providers you use the `ConnectionFactoryResource`
implementation that is provided with SJMS as-is or extend as it is
optimized for this component.

Below is an example of using the plugable ConnectionResource with the
ActiveMQ `PooledConnectionFactory`:

[source,java]
----
public class AMQConnectionResource implements ConnectionResource {
    private PooledConnectionFactory pcf;

    public AMQConnectionResource(String connectString, int maxConnections) {
        super();
        pcf = new PooledConnectionFactory(connectString);
        pcf.setMaxConnections(maxConnections);
        pcf.start();
    }

    public void stop() {
        pcf.stop();
    }

    @Override
    public Connection borrowConnection() throws Exception {
        Connection answer = pcf.createConnection();
        answer.start();
        return answer;
    }

    @Override
    public Connection borrowConnection(long timeout) throws Exception {
        // SNIPPED...
    }

    @Override
    public void returnConnection(Connection connection) throws Exception {
        // Do nothing since there isn't a way to return a Connection
        // to the instance of PooledConnectionFactory
        log.info("Connection returned");
    }
}
----

Then pass in the `ConnectionResource` to the `SjmsComponent`:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext camelContext = new DefaultCamelContext();
AMQConnectionResource pool = new AMQConnectionResource("tcp://localhost:33333", 1);
SjmsComponent component = new SjmsComponent();
component.setConnectionResource(pool);
camelContext.addComponent("sjms", component);
----

=== Customizable Transaction Commit Strategies (Local JMS Transactions only)

SJMS provides a developer the means to create a custom and plugable
transaction strategy through the use of the `TransactionCommitStrategy`
interface. This allows a user to define a unique set of circumstances
that the `SessionTransactionSynchronization`
will use to determine when to commit the Session.
An example of its use is the `BatchTransactionCommitStrategy`
which is detailed further in the next section.

=== Transacted Batch Consumers

The SJMS component has been designed to support the batching of local JMS
transactions on the consumer endpoints. How they are
handled on each is very different though.

The SJMS consumer endpoint is a straightforward implementation that will
process X messages before committing them with the associated Session.
To enable batched transaction on the consumer first enable transactions
by setting the `transacted` parameter to true and then adding the
`transactionBatchCount` and setting it to any value that is greater than
0. For example the following configuration will commit the Session every
10 messages:

[source,text]
----
sjms:queue:transacted.batch.consumer?transacted=true&transactionBatchCount=10
----

If an exception occurs during the processing of a batch on the consumer
endpoint, the Session rollback is invoked causing the messages to be
redelivered to the next available consumer. The counter is also reset to
0 for the `BatchTransactionCommitStrategy` for the associated Session as
well. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure they put hooks in
their processors of batch messages to watch for messages with the
JMSRedelivered header set to true. This is the indicator that messages
were rolled back at some point and that a verification of a successful
processing should occur.

A transacted batch consumer also carries with it an instance of an
internal timer that waits a default amount of time (5000ms) between
messages before committing the open transactions on the Session. The
default value of 5000ms (minimum of 1000ms) should be adequate for most
use-cases but if further tuning is necessary simply set the
`transactionBatchTimeout` parameter.

[source,text]
----
sjms:queue:transacted.batch.consumer?transacted=true&transactionBatchCount=10&transactionBatchTimeout=2000
----

The minimal value that will be accepted is 1000ms as the amount of
context switching may cause unnecessary performance impacts without
gaining benefit.


== Additional Notes

=== Message Header Format

The SJMS Component uses the same header format strategy that is used in
the Camel JMS Component. This plugable strategy ensures that messages
sent over the wire conform to the JMS Message spec.

For the `exchange.in.header` the following rules apply for the header
keys:

* Keys starting with `JMS` or `JMSX` are reserved.
* `exchange.in.headers` keys must be literals and all be valid Java
identifiers (do not use dots in the key name).
* Camel replaces dots & hyphens and the reverse when when consuming JMS
messages:

** is replaced by _DOT_ and the reverse replacement when Camel consumes
the message.
** is replaced by _HYPHEN_ and the reverse replacement when Camel
consumes the message.See also the option `jmsKeyFormatStrategy`,
which allows use of your own custom strategy for formatting keys.

=== Message Content

To deliver content over the wire we must ensure that the body of the
message that is being delivered adheres to the JMS Message
Specification. Therefore, all that are produced must either be
primitives or their counter objects (such as `Integer`, `Long`, `Character`).
The types, `String`, `CharSequence`, `Date`, `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` are all
converted to their `toString()` representation. All other types are
dropped.

=== Clustering

When using _InOut_ with SJMS in a clustered environment you must either
use TemporaryQueue destinations or use a unique named reply to
destination per InOut producer endpoint. Message correlation is handled
by the endpoint, not with message selectors at the broker. The InOut
Producer Endpoint uses Java Concurrency Exchangers cached by the Message
`JMSCorrelationID`. This provides a nice performance increase while
reducing the overhead on the broker since all the messages are consumed
from the destination in the order they are produced by the interested
consumer.

[NOTE]
====
You should only use queues as destination types, topics is not recommended or fully supported.
====

Currently the only correlation strategy is to use the `JMSCorrelationId`.
The _InOut_ Consumer uses this strategy as well ensuring that all
responses messages to the included `JMSReplyTo` destination also have the
`JMSCorrelationId` copied from the request as well.

== Transaction Support [[SJMS-transactions]]

SJMS currently only supports the use of internal JMS Transactions. There
is no support for the Camel Transaction Processor or the Java
Transaction API (JTA).

=== Does Springless Mean I Can't Use Spring?

Not at all. Below is an example of the SJMS component using the Spring XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route id="inout.named.reply.to.producer.route">
    <from uri="direct:invoke.named.reply.to.queue" />
    <to uri="sjms:queue:named.reply.to.queue?namedReplyTo=my.response.queue&amp;exchangePattern=InOut" />
</route>
----

Springless refers to moving away from the dependency on the Spring JMS
API. A new JMS client API is being developed from the ground up to power
SJMS.
