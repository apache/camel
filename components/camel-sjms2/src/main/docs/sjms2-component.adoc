*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Simple JMS Component is a JMS component that only uses JMS APIs
and no 3rd-party framework such as Spring JMS.

The component was reworked from Camel 3.8 onwards
to be similar to the existing Camel JMS component that is based on Spring JMS.

The reason is to offer many of the same features and functionality from the JMS component,
but for users that requires lightweight without having to include the Spring Framework.

There are some advanced features in the Spring JMS component that has been omitted, such as
shared queues for request/reply. Spring JMS offers fine grained tunings for concurrency settings,
which can be tweaked for dynamic scaling up and down depending on load. This is a special feature in Spring JMS
that would require substantial code to implement in SJMS2.

The SJMS2 component does not support for Spring or JTA Transaction, however support for internal local transactions
is supported using JMS or Transaction or Client Acknowledge Mode. See more further below.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-sjms2</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

== URI format

----
sjms2:[queue:|topic:]destinationName[?options]
----

Where `destinationName` is a JMS queue or topic name. By default, the
`destinationName` is interpreted as a queue name. For example, to
connect to the queue, `FOO.BAR` use:

----
sjms2:FOO.BAR
----

You can include the optional `queue:` prefix, if you prefer:

----
sjms2:queue:FOO.BAR
----

To connect to a topic, you _must_ include the `topic:` prefix. For
example, to connect to the topic, `Stocks.Prices`, use:

----
sjms2:topic:Stocks.Prices
----

You append query options to the URI using the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`



// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

== Reuse endpoint and send to different destinations computed at runtime

If you need to send messages to a lot of different JMS destinations, it
makes sense to reuse a SJMS endpoint and specify the real destination in
a message header. This allows Camel to reuse the same endpoint, but send
to different destinations. This greatly reduces the number of endpoints
created and economizes on memory and thread resources.

TIP: Using xref:eips:toD-eip.adoc[toD] is easier than specifying the dynamic destination with a header

You can specify the destination in the following headers:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=====================================================================
|Header |Type |Description
|`CamelJmsDestinationName` |`String` |The destination name.
|=====================================================================

For example, the following route shows how you can compute a destination
at run time and use it to override the destination appearing in the JMS
URL:

[source,java]
--------------------------------
from("file://inbox")
  .to("bean:computeDestination")
  .to("sjms2:queue:dummy");
--------------------------------

The queue name, `dummy`, is just a placeholder. It must be provided as
part of the JMS endpoint URL, but it will be ignored in this example.

In the `computeDestination` bean, specify the real destination by
setting the `CamelJmsDestinationName` header as follows:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
public void setJmsHeader(Exchange exchange) {
   String id = ....
   exchange.getIn().setHeader("CamelJmsDestinationName", "order:" + id");
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then Camel will read this header and use it as the destination instead
of the one configured on the endpoint. So, in this example Camel sends
the message to `sjms2:queue:order:2`, assuming the `id` value was 2.

Keep in mind that the JMS producer removes both `CamelJmsDestinationName`
headers from the exchange and do not propagate  them to the created JMS
message in order to avoid the accidental loops
in the routes (in scenarios when the message will be forwarded to the
another JMS endpoint).

== Using toD

If you need to send messages to a lot of different JMS destinations, it
makes sense to reuse a SJMS2 endpoint and specify the dynamic destinations
with simple language using xref:eips:toD-eip.adoc[toD].

For example suppose you need to send messages to queues with order types,
then using toD could for example be done as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------
from("direct:order")
  .toD("sjms2:order-${header.orderType}");
--------------------------------

== Additional Notes

=== Local transactions

When using `transacted=true` then JMS Transacted Acknowledge Mode are in use.
The SJMS2 component supports this from both the consumer and producers. If a consumer
is transacted, then the active JMS Session will commit or rollback at the end of processing the message.

SJMS2 producers that are `transacted=true` will also defer until the end of processing the message
before the the active JMS Session will commit or rollback.

You can combine consumer and producer, such as:

[source,java]
----
from("sjms2:cheese?transacted=true")
  .to("bean:foo")
  .to("sjms2:foo?transacted=true")
  .to("bean:bar");
----

Here the consumer and producer are both transacted, which means that only at the end of processing the message,
then both the consumer and the producer will commit (or rollback in case of an exception during routing).

=== Message Header Format

The SJMS2 Component uses the same header format strategy that is used in
the Camel JMS Component. This plugable strategy ensures that messages
sent over the wire conform to the JMS Message spec.

For the `exchange.in.header` the following rules apply for the header
keys:

* Keys starting with `JMS` or `JMSX` are reserved.
* `exchange.in.headers` keys must be literals and all be valid Java
identifiers (do not use dots in the key name).
* Camel replaces dots & hyphens and the reverse when when consuming JMS
messages:

** is replaced by _DOT_ and the reverse replacement when Camel consumes
the message.
** is replaced by _HYPHEN_ and the reverse replacement when Camel
consumes the message.See also the option `jmsKeyFormatStrategy`,
which allows use of your own custom strategy for formatting keys.

=== Message Content

To deliver content over the wire we must ensure that the body of the
message that is being delivered adheres to the JMS Message
Specification. Therefore, all that are produced must either be
primitives or their counter objects (such as `Integer`, `Long`, `Character`).
The types, `String`, `CharSequence`, `Date`, `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` are all
converted to their `toString()` representation. All other types are
dropped.

=== Clustering

When using _InOut_ with SJMS2 in a clustered environment you must either
use TemporaryQueue destinations or use a unique reply to
destination per InOut producer endpoint. Message correlation is handled
by the producer, not with message selectors at the broker.

[NOTE]
====
You should only use queues as reply-to destination types, topics is not recommended or fully supported.
====

Currently the only correlation strategy is to use the `JMSCorrelationId`.
The _InOut_ Consumer uses this strategy as well ensuring that all
responses messages to the included `JMSReplyTo` destination also have the
`JMSCorrelationId` copied from the request as well.
