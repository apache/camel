*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Google Pubsub component provides access
to https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/[Cloud Pub/Sub Infrastructure] via
the https://github.com/googleapis/java-pubsub[Google Cloud Java Client for Google Cloud Pub/Sub].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-google-pubsub</artifactId>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------

== URI Format

The Google Pubsub Component uses the following URI format:

----
google-pubsub://project-id:destinationName?[options]
----

Destination Name can be either a topic or a subscription name.


// component options: START
// component options: END
// endpoint options: START
// endpoint options: END


== Producer Endpoints

Producer endpoints can accept and deliver to PubSub individual and grouped
exchanges alike. Grouped exchanges have `Exchange.GROUPED_EXCHANGE` property set.

Google PubSub expects the payload to be byte[] array, Producer endpoints will send:

* String body as byte[] encoded as UTF-8
* byte[] body as is
* Everything else will be serialised into byte[] array

A Map set as message header `GooglePubsubConstants.ATTRIBUTES` will be sent as PubSub attributes.

Google PubSub supports ordered message delivery.

To enable this set set the options messageOrderingEnabled to true, and the pubsubEndpoint to a GCP region.

When producing messages set the message header `GooglePubsubConstants.ORDERING_KEY` . This will be set as the PubSub orderingKey for the message.

More information in https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering[Ordering messages].
 
Once exchange has been delivered to PubSub the PubSub Message ID will be assigned to
the header `GooglePubsubConstants.MESSAGE_ID`.

== Consumer Endpoints
Google PubSub will redeliver the message if it has not been acknowledged within the time period set
as a configuration option on the subscription.

The component will acknowledge the message once exchange processing has been completed.

If the route throws an exception, the exchange is marked as failed and the component will NACK the message -
it will be redelivered immediately.

To ack/nack the message the component uses Acknowledgement ID stored as header `GooglePubsubConstants.ACK_ID`.
If the header is removed or tampered with, the ack will fail and the message will be redelivered
again after the ack deadline.

== Message Headers

Headers set by the consumer endpoints:

* GooglePubsubConstants.MESSAGE_ID
* GooglePubsubConstants.ATTRIBUTES
* GooglePubsubConstants.PUBLISH_TIME

== Message Body

The consumer endpoint returns the content of the message as byte[] - exactly as the underlying system sends it.
It is up for the route to convert/unmarshall the contents.

== Authentication Configuration

The location of the default credentials file is configurable via the serviceAccountKey parameter.

== Rollback and Redelivery

The rollback for Google PubSub relies on the idea of the Acknowledgement Deadline - the time period where Google PubSub expects to receive the acknowledgement.
If the acknowledgement has not been received, the message is redelivered.

Google provides an API to extend the deadline for a message.

More information in https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber#ack_deadline[Google PubSub Documentation]

So, rollback is effectively a deadline extension API call with zero value - i.e. deadline is reached now and message can
be redelivered to the next consumer.

It is possible to delay the message redelivery by setting the acknowledgement deadline explicitly for the rollback by
setting the message header `GooglePubsubConstants.ACK_DEADLINE` to the value in seconds.
