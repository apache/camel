*{component-header}*


https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/[Azure Cosmos DB] is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service for operational and analytics
workloads. It offers multi-mastering feature by automatically scaling throughput, compute, and storage. This
component interacts with Azure CosmosDB through Azure SQL API.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Windows Azure Storage account. More information is available at
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/[Azure Documentation Portal].

== URI Format

[source,text]
------------------------------
azure-cosmosdb://[databaseName][/containerName][?options]
------------------------------

In case of the consumer, `databaseName`, `containerName` are required, In case of the producer, it depends on the operation that being
requested, for example if operation is on a database level, e.b: deleteDatabase, only `databaseName` is required, but in case
of operation being requested in container level, e.g: readItem, then `databaseName` and `containerName` are required.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format, `?options=value&option2=value&`...


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The Azure CosmosDB component supports 29 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *clientTelemetryEnabled* (common) | Sets the flag to enable client telemetry which will periodically collect database operations aggregation statistics, system information like cpu/memory and send it to cosmos monitoring service, which will be helpful during debugging. DEFAULT value is false indicating this is opt in feature, by default no telemetry collection. | false | boolean
| *configuration* (common) | The component configurations |  | CosmosDbConfiguration
| *connectionSharingAcrossClients{zwsp}Enabled* (common) | Enables connections sharing across multiple Cosmos Clients. The default is false. When you have multiple instances of Cosmos Client in the same JVM interacting to multiple Cosmos accounts, enabling this allows connection sharing in Direct mode if possible between instances of Cosmos Client. Please note, when setting this option, the connection configuration (e.g., socket timeout config, idle timeout config) of the first instantiated client will be used for all other client instances. | false | boolean
| *consistencyLevel* (common) | Sets the consistency levels supported for Azure Cosmos DB client operations in the Azure Cosmos DB service. The requested ConsistencyLevel must match or be weaker than that provisioned for the database account. Consistency levels by order of strength are STRONG, BOUNDED_STALENESS, SESSION and EVENTUAL. Refer to consistency level documentation for additional details: \https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels. There are 5 enums and the value can be one of: Strong, BoundedStaleness, Session, Eventual, ConsistentPrefix | SESSION | ConsistencyLevel
| *containerPartitionKeyPath* (common) | Sets the container partition key path. |  | String
| *contentResponseOnWriteEnabled* (common) | Sets the boolean to only return the headers and status code in Cosmos DB response in case of Create, Update and Delete operations on CosmosItem. In Consumer, it is enabled by default because of the ChangeFeed in the consumer that needs this flag to be enabled and thus is shouldn't be overridden. In Producer, it advised to disable it since it reduces the network overhead | true | boolean
| *cosmosAsyncClient* (common) | *Autowired* Inject an external CosmosAsyncClient into the component which provides a client-side logical representation of the Azure Cosmos DB service. This asynchronous client is used to configure and execute requests against the service. |  | CosmosAsyncClient
| *createContainerIfNotExists* (common) | Sets if the component should create Cosmos container automatically in case it doesn't exist in Cosmos database | false | boolean
| *createDatabaseIfNotExists* (common) | Sets if the component should create Cosmos database automatically in case it doesn't exist in Cosmos account | false | boolean
| *databaseEndpoint* (common) | *Required* Sets the Azure Cosmos database endpoint the component will connect to. |  | String
| *multipleWriteRegionsEnabled* (common) | Sets the flag to enable writes on any regions for geo-replicated database accounts in the Azure Cosmos DB service. When the value of this property is true, the SDK will direct write operations to available writable regions of geo-replicated database account. Writable regions are ordered by PreferredRegions property. Setting the property value to true has no effect until EnableMultipleWriteRegions in DatabaseAccount is also set to true. DEFAULT value is true indicating that writes are directed to available writable regions of geo-replicated database account. | true | boolean
| *preferredRegions* (common) | Sets the preferred regions for geo-replicated database accounts. For example, East US as the preferred region. When EnableEndpointDiscovery is true and PreferredRegions is non-empty, the SDK will prefer to use the regions in the container in the order they are specified to perform operations. |  | List
| *readRequestsFallbackEnabled* (common) | Sets whether to allow for reads to go to multiple regions configured on an account of Azure Cosmos DB service. DEFAULT value is true. If this property is not set, the default is true for all Consistency Levels other than Bounded Staleness, The default is false for Bounded Staleness. 1. endpointDiscoveryEnabled is true 2. the Azure Cosmos DB account has more than one region | true | boolean
| *throughputProperties* (common) | Sets throughput of the resources in the Azure Cosmos DB service. |  | ThroughputProperties
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *changeFeedProcessorOptions* (consumer) | Sets the ChangeFeedProcessorOptions to be used. Unless specifically set the default values that will be used are: maximum items per page or FeedResponse: 100 lease renew interval: 17 seconds lease acquire interval: 13 seconds lease expiration interval: 60 seconds feed poll delay: 5 seconds maximum scale count: unlimited |  | ChangeFeedProcessorOptions
| *createLeaseContainerIfNot{zwsp}Exists* (consumer) | Sets if the component should create Cosmos lease container for the consumer automatically in case it doesn't exist in Cosmos database | false | boolean
| *createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists* (consumer) | Sets if the component should create Cosmos lease database for the consumer automatically in case it doesn't exist in Cosmos account | false | boolean
| *hostName* (consumer) | Sets the hostname. The host: a host is an application instance that uses the change feed processor to listen for changes. Multiple instances with the same lease configuration can run in parallel, but each instance should have a different instance name. If not specified, this will be a generated random hostname. |  | String
| *leaseContainerName* (consumer) | Sets the lease container which acts as a state storage and coordinates processing the change feed across multiple workers. The lease container can be stored in the same account as the monitored container or in a separate account. It will be auto created if createLeaseContainerIfNotExists is set to true. | camel-lease | String
| *leaseDatabaseName* (consumer) | Sets the lease database where the leaseContainerName will be stored. If it is not specified, this component will store the lease container in the same database that is specified in databaseName. It will be auto created if createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists is set to true. |  | String
| *itemId* (producer) | Sets the itemId in case needed for operation on item like delete, replace |  | String
| *itemPartitionKey* (producer) | Sets partition key. Represents a partition key value in the Azure Cosmos DB database service. A partition key identifies the partition where the item is stored in. |  | PartitionKey
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The CosmosDB operation that can be used with this component on the producer. There are 17 enums and the value can be one of: listDatabases, createDatabase, queryDatabases, deleteDatabase, createContainer, replaceDatabaseThroughput, listContainers, queryContainers, deleteContainer, replaceContainerThroughput, createItem, upsertItem, deleteItem, replaceItem, readItem, readAllItems, queryItems | listDatabases | CosmosDbOperationsDefinition
| *query* (producer) | An SQL query to execute on a given resources. To learn more about Cosmos SQL API, check this link {link \https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-getting-started} |  | String
| *queryRequestOptions* (producer) | Set additional QueryRequestOptions that can be used with queryItems, queryContainers, queryDatabases, listDatabases, listItems, listContainers operations |  | CosmosQueryRequestOptions
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accountKey* (security) | *Required* Sets either a master or readonly key used to perform authentication for accessing resource. |  | String

== Authentication Information

To use this component, you have 2 options in order to provide the required Azure authentication information:

- Provide `accountKey` and `databaseEndpoint` for your Azure CosmosDB account. The account key can
be generated through your CosmosDB Azure portal.
- Provide a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.cosmos.cosmosasyncclient?view=azure-java-stable[CosmosAsyncClient] instance which can be
provided into `cosmosAsyncClient`.


== Async Consumer and Producer

This component implements the async Consumer and producer.

This allows camel route to consume and produce events asynchronously without blocking any threads.

== Usage

For example in order to consume records from a specific container in a specific database to a file, use the following snippet:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("azure-cosmosdb://camelDb/myContainer?accountKey=MyaccountKey&databaseEndpoint=https//myazure.com:443&leaseDatabaseName=myLeaseDB&createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists=true&createLeaseContainerIfNotExists=true").
to("file://directory");

=== Azure CosmosDB Consumer
Camel Azure CosmosDB uses https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed-design-patterns[ChangeFeed pattern] to capture a feed of events and feed them into the Camel in an Async manner, something similar to Change Data Capture (CDC) design pattern.
However, it doesn't capture deletes as these are removed from the feed as well.

To use the Camel Azure CosmosDB, `containerName` and `databaseName` are required. However, there are more options that need to be set in order to use this feature:

- `leaseDatabaseName` : Sets the lease database where the `leaseContainerName` will be stored. If it is not specified, this component will store the lease container in the same database that is specified in databaseName. It will be auto created if `createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists` is set to true.
- `leaseContainerName` : Sets the lease container which acts as a state storage and coordinates processing the change feed across multiple workers. The lease container can be stored in the same account as the monitored container or in a separate account. It will be auto created if `createLeaseContainerIfNotExists` is set to true. If not specified, this component will create container called `camel-lease`.
- `hostName` : Sets the hostname. The host: a host is an application instance that uses the change feed processor to listen for changes. Multiple instances with the same lease configuration can run in parallel, but each instance should have a different instance name. If not specified, this will be a generated random hostname.
- `changeFeedProcessorOptions` : Sets additional options for the change feed processor.

The consumer will set `List<Map<String,>>` in exchange message body which reflect list of items in a single feed.

==== Example:
For example to listen to the events in `myContainer` container in `myDb`:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("azure-cosmosdb://myDb/myContainer?leaseDatabaseName=myLeaseDb&createLeaseDatabaseIfNotExists=true&createLeaseContainerIfNotExists=true")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=== Development Notes (Important)

When developing on this component, you will need to obtain your Azure accessKey in order to run the integration tests. In addition to the mocked unit tests
you *will need to run the integration tests with every change you make or even client upgrade as the Azure client can break things even on minor versions upgrade.*
To run the integration tests, on this component directory, run the following maven command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Dendpoint={{dbaddress}} -DaccessKey={{accessKey}}
----
Whereby `endpoint` is your Azure CosmosDB endpoint name and `accessKey` is the access key being generated from Azure CosmosDB portal.
