#
# A marker for PrepareComponentMojo that we really want to package a Camel component.
#
# During maven build, PrepareComponentMojo probes for apriory existence of
# src/generated/resources/META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/
# so this MANUALLY created file under src/generated/.. ensures the probed
# path exists and PrepareComponentMojo understands our intent.
#
# If this file is placed under src/main/resource/... PrepareComponentMojo
# does not understand our intent.
