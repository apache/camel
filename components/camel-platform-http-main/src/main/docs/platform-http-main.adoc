*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-platform-http-main is an embedded HTTP server for `camel-main` standalone applications.

The embedded HTTP server is using VertX from the `camel-platform-http-vertx` dependency.

== Enabling

The HTTP server for `camel-main` is disabled by default, and you need to explicitly enable this
by setting `camel.server.enabled=true` in application.properties.

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-platform-http-main` dependency to the classpath.
Then, the platform http component should auto-detect this.
