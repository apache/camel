*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-platform-http-main is an embedded HTTP server for `camel-main` standalone applications.

The embedded HTTP server is using VertX from the `camel-platform-http-vertx` dependency.

== Enabling

The HTTP server for `camel-main` (is default disabled), and you need to explicit enable this
by setting `camel.server.enabled=true` in application.properties.

== Auto detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-platform-http-main` dependency to the classpath,
and the platform http component should auto-detect this.
