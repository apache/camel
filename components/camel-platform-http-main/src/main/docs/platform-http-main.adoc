*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-platform-http-main is an embedded HTTP server for `camel-main` standalone applications.

The embedded HTTP server is using VertX from the `camel-platform-http-vertx` dependency.

== Enabling

The HTTP server for `camel-main` is disabled by default, and you need to explicitly enable this
by setting `camel.server.enabled=true` in application.properties.

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-platform-http-main` dependency to the classpath.
Then, the platform http component should auto-detect this.

== Uploading and downloading files

The embedded HTTP server comes with a set of features out of the box, that can be enabled.

These features are as follows:

- `/q/info` - Report basic information about Camel
- `/dev/console` - Developer console that provides a lot of statistics and information
- `/q/health` - Health checks
- `/q/jolokia` - To use Jolokia to expose JMX over HTTP REST
- `/q/metrics` - To provide otel metrics in prometheus format
- `/q/upload` - Uploading source files, to allow hot reloading.
- `/q/download` - Downloading source files, to allow inspecting
- `/q/send` - Sending messages to the Camel application via HTTP
- `/` - Serving static content such as html, javascript, css, and images to make it easy to embed very small web applications.

You configure these features in the `application.properties` file using the `camel.server.xxx` options.
