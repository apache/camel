*Since Camel {since}*

The Camel Smooks component uses https://www.smooks.org/[Smooks] to break up the structured data (EDI, CSV, POJO, etc...) of a Camel message body into fragments. These fragments can be processed independently of one another from within Smooks.

Common applications of Smooks include:

* transformation: EDI to CSV, POJO to EDI, POJO to XML, and so on.
* scalable processing: process huge payloads while keeping a small memory footprint. Split, transform, and route fragments to destinations such as JMS queues, file systems, and databases.
* enrichment: enrich fragments with data from a database or other data sources.
* Java binding: populate POJOs from a source such as CSV, EDI, XML, and other POJOs.

Use the xref:dataformats:smooks-dataformat.adoc[Smooks Data Format] instead of this component when you are primarily interested in transformation and binding; not other Smooks features like routing.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`.

[source,xml]

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-smooks</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->

== Usage

Using the Smooks component lets you leverage all the features of Smooks, such as transformation and fragment-driven routing, from within Camel. You can take an existing Smooks configuration and use this in your Camel routes as shown below:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("file:inputDir?noop=true")
    .to("smooks:smooks-config.xml")
    .to("jms:queue:order");
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: file:inputDir?noop=true
    steps:
      - to: smooks:smooks-config.xml
      - to: jms:queue:order
----
====

The Smooks component is configured with a mandatory configuration file, which is `smooks-config.xml` in the example above. It is not clear what type of output the component is producing from looking at the above route. By default, the message body output is a stream but the type of output can be changed by configuring `{https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/smooks-core-1.6.xsd}exports` in `smooks-config.xml` as shown in this Smooks configuration:

.smooks-config.xml
[source,xml]
----
<smooks-resource-list xmlns="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks-2.0.xsd"
        xmlns:edi="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/edi-2.0.xsd"
        xmlns:core="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/smooks-core-1.6.xsd">

    <core:exports>
        <core:result type="org.smooks.io.sink.StringSink"/>
    </core:exports>

    <edi:parser schemaUri="/edi-mapping-model.dfdl.xsd" segmentTerminator="%NL;" dataElementSeparator="*"
                compositeDataElementSeparator="^"/>

</smooks-resource-list>
----

The example `<core:exports>` configures Smooks to export the execution result to Camel as a string. Keep in mind that exporting the result as string means that the whole result will be kept in-memory which could cause unexpected performance issues for large payloads.
