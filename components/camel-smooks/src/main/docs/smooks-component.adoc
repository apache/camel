*Since Camel {since}*

The Camel Smooks component uses https://www.smooks.org/[Smooks] to break up the structured data (EDI, CSV, POJO, etc...) of a Camel message body into fragments. These fragments can be processed independently of one another from within Smooks.

Common applications of Smooks include:

* transformation: EDI to CSV, POJO to EDI, POJO to XML, and so on.
* scalable processing: process huge payloads while keeping a small memory footprint.
* split, transform, and route fragments to destinations such as JMS queues, file systems, and databases.
* enrichment: enrich fragments with data from a database or other data sources.
* Java binding: populate POJOs from a source such as CSV, EDI, XML, and other POJOs.

Use the xref:dataformats:smooks-dataformat.adoc[Smooks Data Format] instead of this component when you are primarily interested in transformation and binding. This should be used for other Smooks features, like routing.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`.

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-smooks</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>

== Usage

Using the Smooks component lets you leverage all the features of Smooks, such as transformation and fragment-driven routing, from within Camel. You can take an existing Smooks configuration and reference it from your Camel routes as shown below:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
from("file:inputDir?noop=true")
    .to("smooks:smooks-config.xml")
    .to("jms:queue:order");
----

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: file:inputDir?noop=true
    steps:
      - to: smooks:smooks-config.xml
      - to: jms:queue:order
----
====

The Smooks component is configured with a mandatory configuration file, which is `smooks-config.xml` in the example above. It is not clear what type of output the component is producing from looking at the above route. By default, the message body output is a stream but the type of output can be changed by configuring `{https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/smooks-core-1.6.xsd}exports` in the Smooks configuration as shown next:

.smooks-config.xml
[source,xml]
----
<smooks-resource-list xmlns="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks-2.0.xsd"
        xmlns:edi="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/edi-2.0.xsd"
        xmlns:core="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/smooks-core-1.6.xsd">

    <core:exports>
        <core:result type="org.smooks.io.sink.StringSink"/>
    </core:exports>

    <edi:parser schemaUri="/edi-mapping-model.dfdl.xsd" segmentTerminator="%NL;" dataElementSeparator="*"
                compositeDataElementSeparator="^"/>

</smooks-resource-list>
----

The `{https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/smooks-core-1.6.xsd}exports` element in this example configures Smooks to export the execution result to Camel as a string. Keep in mind that exporting the result as string means that the whole result will be kept in-memory which could cause unexpected performance issues for large payloads.

=== Bean routing

Smooks is capable of routing fragments to Camel endpoints using the `{https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/camel-1.5.xsd}route` element from the Smooks configuration. As an example, you can route to an endpoint by declaring the following in your Smooks configuration:

.smooks-config.xml
[source,xml]
----
<smooks-resource-list xmlns="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks-2.0.xsd"
                      xmlns:jb="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/javabean-1.6.xsd"
                      xmlns:camel="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/camel-1.5.xsd">

  <!-- Create some bean instances from the input source... -->
  <jb:bean beanId="orderItem"  ...>
    <!-- etc... See Smooks Java Binding docs -->
  </jb:bean>

  <!-- Route bean to camel endpoints... -->
  <camel:route beanId="orderItem">
    <camel:to endpoint="direct:slow" if="orderItem.priority == 'Normal'"/>
    <camel:to endpoint="direct:express" if="orderItem.priority == 'High'"/>
  </camel:route>

</smooks-resource-list>
----

The file above configures Smooks to route the Java bean `orderItem` in the https://www.smooks.org/documentation/#bean_context[bean context] to the endpoints `direct:slow` and `direct:express`, depending on whether the `priority` field of the `orderItem` instance is equal to `Normal` or `High`. It is possible to route based on an event selector rather than a condition thanks to the `routeOnElement` XML attribute:

.smooks-config.xml
[source,xml]
----
<smooks-resource-list xmlns="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks-2.0.xsd"
                      xmlns:jb="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/javabean-1.6.xsd"
                      xmlns:camel="https://www.smooks.org/xsd/smooks/camel-1.5.xsd">

  <!-- Create some bean instances from the input source... -->
  <jb:bean beanId="orderItem"  ...>
    <!-- etc... See Smooks Java Binding docs -->
  </jb:bean>

  <!-- Route bean to camel endpoints... -->
  <camel:route beanId="orderItem" routeOnElement="order">
    <camel:to endpoint="direct:all"/>
  </camel:route>

</smooks-resource-list>
----

NOTE: instead of routing complex objects to Camel, a https://www.smooks.org/documentation/#pipeline[pipeline] allows you to have a template (e.g., FreeMarker) reference the beans and then route the evaluated template as string (e.g., XML, CSV, etc.) to Camel.
