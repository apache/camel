The Browse component provides a simple
BrowsableEndpoint which can be useful for
testing, visualisation tools or debugging. The exchanges sent to the
endpoint are all available to be browsed.

== URI format

-------------------------
browse:someName[?options]

Where *someName* can be any string to uniquely identify the endpoint.

== Sample

In the route below, we insert a `browse:` component to be able to browse
the Exchanges that are passing through:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:order.in").to("browse:orderReceived").to("bean:processOrder");
----

We can now inspect the received exchanges from within the Java code:

[source,java]
----
private CamelContext context;

public void inspectReceivedOrders() {
    BrowsableEndpoint browse = context.getEndpoint("browse:orderReceived", BrowsableEndpoint.class);
    List<Exchange> exchanges = browse.getExchanges();

    // then we can inspect the list of received exchanges from Java
    for (Exchange exchange : exchanges) {
        String payload = exchange.getIn().getBody();
        // do something with payload
    }
}
