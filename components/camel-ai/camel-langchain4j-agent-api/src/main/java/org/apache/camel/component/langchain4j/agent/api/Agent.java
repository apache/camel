/**
 * Core agent interface that abstracts different types of AI agents within the Apache Camel LangChain4j integration.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a unified abstraction for interacting with AI agents, regardless of whether they support
 * memory persistence or operate in a stateless manner. It serves as the primary contract for chat interactions between
 * Camel routes and LangChain4j AI services.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations handle the complexity of configuring LangChain4j AI services, including:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Chat model integration</li>
 * <li>Memory management (for stateful agents)</li>
 * <li>Tool provider integration</li>
 * <li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) support</li>
 * <li>Input and output guardrails</li>
 * </ul>

     * This method serves as a payload adapter that ensures consistent input format for AI agent chat interactions. It
     * handles different payload types and automatically extracts relevant headers to construct a properly formatted
     * {@link AiAgentBody} object.

     * <li>If the payload is a {@link String}, it creates a new {@link AiAgentBody} with:

     * <li>The string as the user message</li>
     * <li>The {@link Headers#SYSTEM_MESSAGE} header value as the system message (if present)</li>
     * <li>The {@link Headers#MEMORY_ID} header value as the memory identifier (if present)</li>
