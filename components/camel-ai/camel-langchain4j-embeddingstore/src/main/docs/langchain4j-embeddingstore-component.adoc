*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The LangChain4j Embedding Store component provides integration with https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j[LangChain4j] embedding stores for vector database operations. This component enables storing, retrieving, and searching embeddings across multiple vector database implementations through LangChain4j's unified interface.

== Features

The LangChain4j Embedding Store component offers the following key features:

* **Vector Operations**: Add, remove, and search embeddings in vector databases
* **Similarity Search**: Perform semantic search with configurable scoring thresholds
* **Metadata Filtering**: Search with metadata-based constraints using filters
* **Multi-Database Support**: Support for various vector databases including Qdrant, Milvus, Weaviate, Neo4j, and others
* **Flexible Configuration**: Configure embedding stores via direct instances or factory patterns

== Supported Operations

The component supports three main operations controlled by the `CamelLangchain4jEmbeddingStoreAction` header:

* **ADD** - Store embeddings with optional text segments and metadata
* **REMOVE** - Delete embeddings by their unique identifier
* **SEARCH** - Perform similarity search with configurable filters and scoring
