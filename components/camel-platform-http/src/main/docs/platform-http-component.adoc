*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Platform HTTP is used to allow Camel to use the existing HTTP server from the runtime.
For example when running Camel on Spring Boot, Quarkus, or other runtimes.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-platform-http</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

== Platform HTTP Provider

To use Platform HTTP a provider (engine) is required to be available on the classpath.
The purpose is to have drivers for different runtimes such as Quarkus, VertX, or Spring Boot.

At this moment there is only support for Quarkus and VertX by `camel-platform-http-vertx`.
This JAR must be on the classpath otherwise the Platform HTTP component cannot be used and an
exception will be thrown on startup.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-platform-http-vertx</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== Implementing a reverse proxy

Platform HTTP component can act as a reverse proxy, in that case some headers are populated from the absolute URL received on the request line of the HTTP request. Those headers are specific to the underlining platform.

At this moment, this feature is only supported for Vert.x in `camel-platform-http-vertx` component.
