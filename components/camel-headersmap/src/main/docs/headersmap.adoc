## HeadersMap

*Available as of Camel 2.20*

The camel-headersmap is a faster implementation of a case-insenstive map which can be plugged in
and used by Camel at runtime to have slight faster performance in the Camel Message headers.

### Auto detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-headersmap` dependency to the classpath,
and Camel should auto-detect this on startup and log as follows:

```
Detected and using custom HeadersMapFactory: org.apache.camel.component.headersmap.FastHeadersMapFactory@71e9ebae
```

For spring-boot there is a `camel-headersmap-starter` dependency you should use.

### Manual enabling

If you use OSGi or the implementation is not added to the classpath, you need to enable this explict such .Title

```
CamelContext camel = ...

camel.setHeadersMapFactory(new FastHeadersMapFactory());
```

Or in XML DSL (spring or blueprint XML file) you can declare the factory as a `<bean>`

```
<bean id="fastMapFactory" class="org.apache.camel.component.headersmap.FastHeadersMapFactory"/>
```

and then Camel should detect the bean and use the factory, which is logged:
