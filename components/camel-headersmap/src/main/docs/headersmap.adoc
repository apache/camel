*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-headersmap is a faster implementation of a case-insenstive map which can be plugged in
and used by Camel at runtime to have slight faster performance in the Camel Message headers.

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-headersmap` dependency to the classpath,
and Camel should auto-detect this on startup and log as follows:

[source,text]
----
Detected and using HeadersMapFactory: camel-headersmap
