*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The camel Etcd component allows you to work with Etcd, a distributed reliable key-value store.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-etcd3</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== Producer Operations (Since 3.20)

The following ETCD operations are currently supported. Simply
set the exchange header with a key of "CamelEtcdAction"
and a value set to one of the following.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|operation |input message body | output message body |description

|set |*String* value of the key-value pair to put |*PutResponse* result of a put operation| Puts a new key-value pair into etcd where the option "path" or the exchange header "CamelEtcdPath" is the key.
You can set the key charset by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdKeyCharset".
You can set the value charset by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdValueCharset".

|get |None |*GetResponse* result of the get operation | Retrieves the key-value pair(s) that match with the key corresponding to
the option "path" or the exchange header "CamelEtcdPath".
You can set the key charset by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdKeyCharset".
You indicate if the key is a prefix by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdIsPrefix" to true.

|delete |None |*DeleteResponse* result of the delete operation |Deletes the key-value pair(s) that match with the key corresponding to
the option "path" or the exchange header "CamelEtcdPath".
You can set the key charset by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdKeyCharset".
You indicate if the key is a prefix by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdIsPrefix" to true.

== Consumer (Since 3.20)

The consumer of the etcd components allows to watch changes on the matching key-value pair(s). One exchange is created per event with the header "CamelEtcdPath" set to the path of the corresponding key-value pair and the body
of type *WatchEvent*.

You can set the key charset by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdKeyCharset".
You indicate if the key is a prefix by setting the exchange header with
the key "CamelEtcdIsPrefix" to true.

By default, the consumer receives only the latest changes, but it is also possible to start watching events from a specific revision by setting the option "fromIndex" to the expected starting index.

== AggregationRepository

The Etcd3 component provides an `AggregationStrategy` to use Etcd as the backend datastore.

== RoutePolicy (Since 3.20)

The Etcd3 component provides a `RoutePolicy` to use Etcd as clustered lock.
