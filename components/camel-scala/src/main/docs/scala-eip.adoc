[[ScalaDSL-SupportedDSL]]
= Scala Supported DSL

The Scala DSL supports *every* DSL from the
Java DSL.

On this page we have examples for a number of the EIPs.

 You can check the
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-scala/src/test/scala/[unit
test source code] for the Scala Component to find more examples.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Messagingsystems]]
== Messaging systems

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Pipelinepipeline]]
=== Pipeline

There is a simple syntax available for specifying pipeline, by simple
putting `to` or `→` between the different steps in the pipeline.

For more advanced use cases, you can also use a block-based syntax,
where every step in the pipeline starts with either `to` or `→`.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Filterfilter]]
=== Filter

For a message filter, use the `when()` method with a parameter of type
The `Exchange ⇒ Boolean`. In the example below, we use a Scala
convenience method named `in` to access the 'in' message body; only
messages where the 'in' message is `<hello/>` will arrive at the
`mock:a` endpoint.

Once again, if you need to specify a more advanced route, you can use
the more elaborate syntax.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Messagingchannels]]
== Messaging channels

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Deadletterchannel]]
=== Dead letter channel

The http://www.eaipatterns.com/DeadLetterChannel.html[dead letter
channel] can be created with the syntax similar to the one used in
http://camel.apache.org/dead-letter-channel.html[Java DSL].

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------
"jms:in" errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("jms:error")) to "jms:out"
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use different error handler available for the
http://camel.apache.org/error-handler.html[Java DSL]. In particular
Scala DSL supports
http://camel.apache.org/defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler]
and
http://camel.apache.org/error-handler.html#ErrorHandler-LoggingErrorHandler[LoggingErrorHandler].

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DefaultErrorHandler
"jms:in" errorHandler(defaultErrorHandler) to "jms:out"

// LoggingErrorHandler
"jms:in" errorHandler(loggingErrorHandler.level(LoggingLevel.INFO).logName("com.example.MyLogger")) to "jms:out"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Messagerouting]]
== Message routing

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Aggregator]]
=== Aggregator

The aggregator EIP aggregates messages based on some message correlation
criteria. In the Scala DSL, the `aggregate` method takes a function
`Exchange ⇒ Any` to determine the correlation value for the exchange. In
the sample below, message are being aggregated if the first 7 letters in
the message body are the same.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Contentbasedrouter]]
=== Content based router

Similar to the Filter, the content based router
uses `when` methods with `Exchange ⇒ Boolean` function literals and an
optional `otherwise`. The function literal can contain plain Scala code
as well as any of the xref:scala-supported-languages.adoc[supported
languages]. The example below routes a given message based on the
language of the message body.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Delayer]]
=== Delayer

Unlike a throttler, which only slows down messages if the rate exceeds a
threshold, a delayer delays every messages with a fixed amount of time.
An example: to delay every message going from `seda:a` to `mock:a` with
1 second, you write...

Our second example will delay the entire block (containing `mock:c`)
without doing anything to `mock:b`

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Loadbalancer]]
=== Load balancer

To distribute the message handling load over multiple endpoints, we add
a `loadbalance` to our route definition. You can optionally specify a
load balancer strategy, like `roundrobin`

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Multicast]]
=== Multicast

Multicast allows you to send a message to multiple endpoints at the same
time. In a simple route, you can specify multiple targets in the `to` or
`→` method call:

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Recipientlist]]
=== Recipient list

You can handle a static recipient list with a multicast or
pipeline, but this EIP is usually applied when
you want to dynamically determine the name(s) of the next endpoint(s) to
route to. Use the `recipients()` method with a function literal
(`Exchange => Any`) that returns the endpoint name(s). In the example
below, the target endpoint name can be found in the String message
starting at position 21.

Because the `recipients()` method just takes a function literal, you can
basically use any kind of valid Scala code to determine the endpoint
name. Have a look at the next example which uses pattern matching to
figure out where to send the message:

Again, we can also use the same thing in a more block-like syntax. For
this example, we use the Scala DSL's
support for JXPath to determine
the target.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Resequencer]]
=== Resequencer

Use the `resequence` method to add a resequencer to the RouteBuilder.
The method takes a function (`Exchange ⇒ Unit`) that determines the
value to resequence on. In this example, we resequence messages based on
the 'in' message body.

The same EIP can also be used with a block-like syntax...

... and with configurable batch size. In this last example, messages
will be send to `mock:e` whenever a batch of 5 messages is available.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Splitter]]
=== Splitter

To handle large message in smaller chunks, you can write a Scala
`Exchange ⇒ Any*` method and add it to your route with the `splitter`
method. As with many other EIPs, we support a short, in-line version as
well as a more elaborate block based one.

The above examples also show you how
other languages like XPath can
be within the Scala DSL.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Throttler]]
=== Throttler

The throttler allows you to slow down messages before sending them
along. The `throttle` methods allows you to specify the maximum
throughput rate of message:

It can also be used in front of block to throttle messages at that
point. In the example below, message are passed on to `mock:b` in a
normal rate (i.e. as fast as possible), but a maximum 3 messages/2
seconds will arrive at the `mock:c` endpoint.

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Messagetransformation]]
== Message transformation

[[ScalaDSL-EIP-Contentenricher]]
=== Content enricher

Using a processor function (`Exchange → Unit`), you can alter/enrich the
message content. This example uses a simple function literal to append
`" says Hello"` to the message content:

However, you can also define a separate method/function to handle the
transformation and pass that to the `process` method instead. The
example below uses pattern matching to enrich the message content:

Off course, you can also use any other Camel component (e.g.
xref:velocity-component.adoc[Velocity]) to enrich the content and add it to a
pipeline
