The Quartz component provides a scheduled delivery of messages using
the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[Quartz Scheduler 2.x].  +
 Each endpoint represents a different timer (in Quartz terms, a Trigger
and JobDetail).

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quartz</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------


== URI format

----
quartz://timerName?options
quartz://groupName/timerName?options
quartz://groupName/timerName?cron=expression
quartz://timerName?cron=expression
----

The component uses either a `CronTrigger` or a `SimpleTrigger`. If no
cron expression is provided, the component uses a simple trigger. If no
`groupName` is provided, the quartz component uses the `Camel` group
name.

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START

// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END


== Configuring quartz.properties file

By default, Quartz will look for a `quartz.properties` file in the
`org/quartz` directory of the classpath. If you are using WAR
deployments, this means just drop the quartz.properties in
`WEB-INF/classes/org/quartz`.

However, the Camel xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component also allows you
to configure properties:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Default |Type |Description

|`properties` |`null` |`Properties` |You can configure a `java.util.Properties` instance.

|`propertiesFile` |`null` |`String` |File name of the properties to load from the classpath
|===

To do this, you can configure this in Spring XML as follows

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="quartz" class="org.apache.camel.component.quartz.QuartzComponent">
    <property name="propertiesFile" value="com/mycompany/myquartz.properties"/>
</bean>
----

== Enabling Quartz scheduler in JMX

You need to configure the quartz scheduler properties to enable JMX. +
 That is typically setting the option
`"org.quartz.scheduler.jmx.export"` to a `true` value in the
configuration file.

This option is set to true by default, unless explicitly disabled.

== Clustering

If you use Quartz in clustered mode, e.g., the `JobStore` is clustered.
Then the xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component will *not* pause/remove
triggers when a node is being stopped/shutdown. This allows the trigger
to keep running on the other nodes in the cluster.

NOTE: When running in clustered node, no checking is done to ensure
unique job name/group for endpoints.

== Message Headers

Camel adds the getters from the Quartz Execution Context as header
values. The following headers are added: +
 `calendar`, `fireTime`, `jobDetail`, `jobInstance`, `jobRuntTime`,
`mergedJobDataMap`, `nextFireTime`, `previousFireTime`, `refireCount`,
`result`, `scheduledFireTime`, `scheduler`, `trigger`, `triggerName`,
`triggerGroup`.

The `fireTime` header contains the `java.util.Date` of when the exchange
was fired.

== Using Cron Triggers

Quartz supports
http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html[Cron-like
expressions] for specifying timers in a handy format. You can use these
expressions in the `cron` URI parameter; though, to preserve valid URI
encoding, we allow `+` to be used instead of spaces.

For example, the following will fire a message every five minutes
starting at 12pm (noon) to 6pm on weekdays:

[source,java]
----
from("quartz://myGroup/myTimerName?cron=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI")
    .to("activemq:Totally.Rocks");
----

which is equivalent to using the cron expression

----
0 0/5 12-18 ? * MON-FRI
----

The following table shows the URI character encodings we use to preserve
valid URI syntax:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|URI Character |Cron character

|`+` | _Space_
|===

== Specifying time zone

The Quartz Scheduler allows you to configure time zone per trigger. For
example, to use a time zone of your country, then you can do as follows:

----
quartz://groupName/timerName?cron=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI&trigger.timeZone=Europe/Stockholm
----

The timeZone value is the values accepted by `java.util.TimeZone`.

== Specifying start date

The Quartz Scheduler allows you to configure start date per trigger. You can provide the start date 
in the date format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssz.

----
quartz://groupName/timerName?cron=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI&trigger.startAt=2023-11-22T14:32:36UTC
----

== Specifying end date

The Quartz Scheduler allows you to configure end date per trigger. You can provide the end date 
in the date format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssz.

----
quartz://groupName/timerName?cron=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI&trigger.endAt=2023-11-22T14:32:36UTC
----

Note: Start and end dates may be affected by time drifts and unpredictable behavior during 
daylight-saving time changes.
Exercise caution, especially in environments where precise timing is critical.

== Configuring misfire instructions

The quartz scheduler can be configured with a misfire instruction
to handle misfire situations for the trigger.
The concrete trigger type that you are using will have defined a set of additional `MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_XXX`
constants that may be set as this property's value.

For example, to configure the simple trigger to use misfire instruction 4:

----
quartz://myGroup/myTimerName?trigger.repeatInterval=2000&trigger.misfireInstruction=4
----

And likewise, you can configure the cron trigger with one of its misfire instructions as well:
----
quartz://myGroup/myTimerName?cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?&trigger.misfireInstruction=2
----

The simple and cron triggers have the following misfire instructions representative:

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW = 1 (default)

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be fired now by Scheduler.

This instruction should typically only be used for
'one-shot' (non-repeating) Triggers. If it is used on a trigger with a
repeat count > 0, then it is equivalent to the instruction `MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_REMAINING_REPEAT_COUNT`.

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_EXISTING_REPEAT_COUNT = 2

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to `now` (even if the associated Calendar excludes `now`)
with the repeat count left as-is.  This does obey the
Trigger end-time, however, so if `now` is after the
end-time the Trigger will not fire again.

Use of this instruction causes the trigger to 'forget'
the start-time and repeat-count that it was originally setup with.
This is only an issue if you for some reason wanted to be able to tell what
the original values were at some later time.

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_REMAINING_REPEAT_COUNT = 3

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to `now` (even if the associated Calendar
excludes `now`) with the repeat count set to what it would be, if it had
not missed any firings.
This does obey the Trigger end-time,
however, so if `now` is after the end-time the Trigger will
not fire again.

Use of this instruction causes the trigger to 'forget'
the start-time and repeat-count that it was originally setup with.
Instead, the repeat count on the trigger will be changed to whatever
the remaining repeat count is.
This is only an issue if you for some reason wanted to be able to
tell what the original values were at some later time.

This instruction could cause the Trigger
to go to the 'COMPLETE' state after firing `now`, if all the
repeat-fire-times where missed.

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_REMAINING_COUNT = 4

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to the next scheduled time after `now` - taking into
account any associated Calendar and with the
repeat count set to what it would be, if it had not missed any firings.

WARNING: This instruction could cause the Trigger
to go directly to the 'COMPLETE' state if all fire-times where missed.

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_EXISTING_COUNT = 5

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to the next scheduled time after `now` - taking into
account any associated Calendar, and with the repeat count left unchanged.

WARNING: This instruction could cause the Trigger
to go directly to the 'COMPLETE' state if the end-time of the trigger
has arrived.

=== CronTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_ONCE_NOW = 1 (default)

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the CronTrigger wants to be fired now by Scheduler.

=== CronTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_DO_NOTHING = 2

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the CronTrigger wants to have its
next-fire-time updated to the next time in the schedule after the
current time (taking into account any associated Calendar.
However, it does not want to be fired now.


== Using QuartzScheduledPollConsumerScheduler

The xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component provides a
Polling Consumer scheduler which allows to
use cron based scheduling for xref:eips:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumers] such as the File and FTP
consumers.

For example, to use a cron based expression to poll for files every second
second, then a Camel route can be defined simply as:

[source,java]
----
    from("file:inbox?scheduler=quartz&scheduler.cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?")
       .to("bean:process");
----

Notice we define the `scheduler=quartz` to instruct Camel to use the
xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz-based] scheduler.
Then we use `scheduler.xxx` options to configure the scheduler.
The xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] scheduler requires the cron option to be set.

The following options are supported:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Default |Type |Description

|`quartzScheduler` |`null` |`org.quartz.Scheduler` |To use a custom Quartz scheduler. If none is configured, then the shared
scheduler from the xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component is used.

|`cron` |`null` |`String` |*Mandatory*: To define the cron expression for triggering the polls.

|`triggerId` |`null` |`String` |To specify the trigger id. If none is provided, then a UUID is generated
and used.

|`triggerGroup` |`QuartzScheduledPollConsumerScheduler` |`String` |To specify the trigger group.

|`timeZone` |`Default` |`TimeZone` |The time zone to use for the CRON trigger.
|===

*Important:* Remember configuring these options from the endpoint
URIs must be prefixed with `scheduler.`.
For example, to configure the trigger id and group:

[source,java]
----
    from("file:inbox?scheduler=quartz&scheduler.cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?&scheduler.triggerId=myId&scheduler.triggerGroup=myGroup")
       .to("bean:process");
----

There is also a CRON scheduler in Spring, so you can
use the following as well:

[source,java]
----
    from("file:inbox?scheduler=spring&scheduler.cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?")
       .to("bean:process");
----

== Cron Component Support

The Quartz component can be used as implementation of the Camel Cron component.


Maven users will need to add the following additional dependency to their `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-cron</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Users can then use the cron component instead of the quartz component, as in the following route:

[source,java]
----
    from("cron://name?schedule=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI")
    .to("activemq:Totally.Rocks");
----
