= IronMQ Component

*Since Camel 2.17*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The IronMQ component provides integration with http://www.iron.io/products/mq[IronMQ] an elastic and durable hosted message queue as a service.

The component uses the
https://github.com/iron-io/iron_mq_java[IronMQ java client]
library.

To run it requires a IronMQ account, and a project id and token.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-ironmq</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------------
 ironmq:queueName[?options]
-----------------------------
Where **queueName** identifies the IronMQ queue you want to publish or consume messages from.

== Options







// endpoint options: START
The IronMQ endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
ironmq:queueName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *queueName* | *Required* The name of the IronMQ queue |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (33 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *client* (common) | Reference to a io.iron.ironmq.Client in the Registry. |  | Client
| *ironMQCloud* (common) | IronMq Cloud url. Urls for public clusters: \https://mq-aws-us-east-1-1.iron.io (US) and \https://mq-aws-eu-west-1-1.iron.io (EU) | https://mq-aws-us-east-1-1.iron.io | String
| *preserveHeaders* (common) | Should message headers be preserved when publishing messages. This will add the Camel headers to the Iron MQ message as a json payload with a header list, and a message body. Useful when Camel is both consumer and producer. | false | boolean
| *projectId* (common) | IronMQ projectId |  | String
| *token* (common) | IronMQ token |  | String
| *batchDelete* (consumer) | Should messages be deleted in one batch. This will limit the number of api requests since messages are deleted in one request, instead of one pr. exchange. If enabled care should be taken that the consumer is idempotent when processing exchanges. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *concurrentConsumers* (consumer) | The number of concurrent consumers. | 1 | int
| *maxMessagesPerPoll* (consumer) | Number of messages to poll pr. call. Maximum is 100. | 1 | int
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *timeout* (consumer) | After timeout (in seconds), item will be placed back onto the queue. | 60 | int
| *wait* (consumer) | Time in seconds to wait for a message to become available. This enables long polling. Default is 0 (does not wait), maximum is 30. |  | int
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *visibilityDelay* (producer) | The item will not be available on the queue until this many seconds have passed. Default is 0 seconds. |  | int
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel
| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutorService
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. The value can be one of: none, spring, quartz | none | String
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map
| *startScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | boolean
| *timeUnit* (scheduler) | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. The value can be one of: NANOSECONDS, MICROSECONDS, MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit
| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean

== Message Body
Should be either a String or a array of Strings. In the latter case the batch of strings will be send to IronMQ as one request, creating one message pr. element in the array.

== Producer message headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type | Description
|CamelIronMQOperation |String|If value set to 'CamelIronMQClearQueue' the queue is cleared of unconsumed  messages.
|CamelIronMQMessageId |String or io.iron.ironmq.Ids|The id of the IronMQ message as a String when sending a single message, or a Ids object when sending a array of strings.
|=======================================================================

== Consumer message headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type | Description
|CamelIronMQMessageId    |String|The id of the message.
|CamelIronMQReservationId|String|The reservation id of the message.
|CamelIronMQReservedCount|String|The number of times this message has been reserved.
|=======================================================================


== Consumer example

Consume 50 messages pr. poll from the queue 'testqueue' on aws eu, and save the messages to files.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
from("ironmq:testqueue?ironMQCloud=https://mq-aws-eu-west-1-1.iron.io&projectId=myIronMQProjectid&token=myIronMQToken&maxMessagesPerPoll=50")
  .to("file:somefolder");
--------------------------------------------------

== Producer example
Dequeue from activemq jms and enqueue the messages on IronMQ.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
from("activemq:foo")
  .to("ironmq:testqueue?projectId=myIronMQProjectid&token=myIronMQToken");
