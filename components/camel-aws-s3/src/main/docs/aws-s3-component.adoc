= AWS S3 Storage Service Component

*Since Camel 2.8*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The S3 component supports storing and retrieving objects from/to
https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon's S3] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon S3. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon S3].

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws-s3://bucketNameOrArn[?options]
------------------------------

The bucket will be created if it don't already exists. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

For example in order to read file `hello.txt` from bucket `helloBucket`, use the following snippet:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-s3://helloBucket?accessKey=yourAccessKey&secretKey=yourSecretKey&prefix=hello.txt")
  .to("file:/var/downloaded");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS S3 Storage Service component supports 38 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonS3Client* (common) | Reference to a com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3 in the registry. |  | AmazonS3
| *autoCreateBucket* (common) | Setting the autocreation of the bucket | true | boolean
| *configuration* (common) | The component configuration |  | S3Configuration
| *endpointConfiguration* (common) | Amazon AWS Endpoint Configuration |  | EndpointConfiguration
| *pathStyleAccess* (common) | Whether or not the S3 client should use path style access | false | boolean
| *policy* (common) | The policy for this queue to set in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3#setBucketPolicy() method. |  | String
| *proxyHost* (common) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the SQS client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (common) | Specify a proxy port to be used inside the client definition. |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (common) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the S3 client. The value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (common) | The region in which S3 client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *useIAMCredentials* (common) | Set whether the S3 client should expect to load credentials on an EC2 instance or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | boolean
| *encryptionMaterials* (common) | The encryption materials to use in case of Symmetric/Asymmetric client usage |  | EncryptionMaterials
| *useEncryption* (common) | Define if encryption must be used or not | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *deleteAfterRead* (consumer) | Delete objects from S3 after they have been retrieved. The delete is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not deleted. If this option is false, then the same objects will be retrieve over and over again on the polls. Therefore you need to use the Idempotent Consumer EIP in the route to filter out duplicates. You can filter using the S3Constants#BUCKET_NAME and S3Constants#KEY headers, or only the S3Constants#KEY header. | true | boolean
| *delimiter* (consumer) | The delimiter which is used in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ListObjectsRequest to only consume objects we are interested in. |  | String
| *fileName* (consumer) | To get the object from the bucket with the given file name |  | String
| *includeBody* (consumer) | If it is true, the exchange body will be set to a stream to the contents of the file. If false, the headers will be set with the S3 object metadata, but the body will be null. This option is strongly related to autocloseBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true and autocloseBody to false, it will be up to the caller to close the S3Object stream. Setting autocloseBody to true, will close the S3Object stream automatically. | true | boolean
| *prefix* (consumer) | The prefix which is used in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ListObjectsRequest to only consume objects we are interested in. |  | String
| *autocloseBody* (consumer) | If this option is true and includeBody is true, then the S3Object.close() method will be called on exchange completion. This option is strongly related to includeBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true and autocloseBody to false, it will be up to the caller to close the S3Object stream. Setting autocloseBody to true, will close the S3Object stream automatically. | true | boolean
| *deleteAfterWrite* (producer) | Delete file object after the S3 file has been uploaded | false | boolean
| *keyName* (producer) | Setting the key name for an element in the bucket through endpoint parameter |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *multiPartUpload* (producer) | If it is true, camel will upload the file with multi part format, the part size is decided by the option of partSize | false | boolean

=== S3 Producer operations

Camel-AWS s3 component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- copyObject
- deleteObject
- listBuckets
- deleteBucket
- downloadLink
- listObjects
- getObject (this will return an S3Object instance)
- getObjectRange (this will return an S3Object instance)

=== Advanced AmazonS3 configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the `AmazonS3` instance configuration, you can
create your own instance:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");

ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonS3 client = new AmazonS3Client(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and refer to it in your Camel aws-s3 component configuration:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-s3://MyBucket?amazonS3Client=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Use KMS with the S3 component

To use AWS KMS to encrypt/decrypt data by using AWS infrastructure you can use the options introduced in 2.21.x like in the following example

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("file:tmp/test?fileName=test.txt")
     .setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, constant("testFile"))
     .to("aws-s3://mybucket?amazonS3Client=#client&useAwsKMS=true&awsKMSKeyId=3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll ask to S3, to use the KMS key 3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c, to encrypt the file test.txt. When you'll ask to download this file, the decryption will be done directly before the download.

=== Use "useIAMCredentials" with the s3 component

To use AWS IAM credentials, you must first verify that the EC2 in which you are launching the Camel application on has an IAM role associated with it containing the appropriate policies attached to run effectively.
Keep in mind that this feature should only be set to "true" on remote instances. To clarify even further, you must still use static credentials locally since IAM is an AWS specific component,
but AWS environments should now be easier to manage. After this is implemented and understood, you can set the query parameter "useIAMCredentials" to "true" for AWS environments! To effectively toggle this
on and off based on local and remote environments, you can consider enabling this query parameter with system environment variables. For example, your code could set the "useIAMCredentials" query parameter to "true",
when the system environment variable called "isRemote" is set to true (there are many other ways to do this and this should act as a simple example). Although it doesn't take away the need for static credentials completely,
using IAM credentials on AWS environments takes away the need to refresh on remote environments and adds a major security boost (IAM credentials are refreshed automatically every 6 hours and update when their
policies are updated). This is the AWS recommended way to manage credentials and therefore should be used as often as possible.

=== S3 Producer Operation examples

- CopyObject: this operation copy an object from one bucket to a different one

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {
                    
      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.BUCKET_DESTINATION_NAME, "camelDestinationBucket");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.DESTINATION_KEY, "camelDestinationKey");   
      }
  })
  .to("aws-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=copyObject")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will copy the object with the name expressed in the header camelDestinationKey to the camelDestinationBucket bucket, from the bucket mycamelbucket.

- DeleteObject: this operation deletes an object from a bucket

[source,java]

      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey"); 
      }
  })
  .to("aws-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=deleteObject")
  .to("mock:result");

- ListBuckets: this operation list the buckets for this account in this region

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start")
  .to("aws-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=listBuckets")

      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey"); 
      }
  })
  .to("aws-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=downloadLink")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will create a downloadLink for the file camelKey in the bucket mycamelbucket

- ListObjects: this operation list object in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will list the objects in the mycamelbucket bucket

- GetObject: this operation get a single object in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {
                    
      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey"); 
      }
  })
  .to("aws-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=getObject")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will return an S3Object instance related to the camelKey object in mycamelbucket bucket.

- GetObjectRange: this operation get a single object range in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {
                    
      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.RANGE_START, "0");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.RANGE_END, "9");
      }
  })
  .to("aws-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=getObjectRange")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will return an S3Object instance related to the camelKey object in mycamelbucket bucket, containing a the bytes from 0 to 9.

== Bucket Autocreation

With the option `autoCreateBucket` users are able to avoid the autocreation of an S3 Bucket in case it doesn't exist. The default for this option is `true`.
If set to false any operation on a not-existent bucket in AWS won't be successful and an error will be returned.

== Automatic detection of AmazonS3 client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonS3 bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter, like the example above.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Moving stuff between a bucket and another bucket

Some users like to consume stuff from a bucket and move the content in a different one without using the copyObject feature of this component.
If this is case for you, don't forget to remove the bucketName header from the incoming exchange of the consumer, otherwise the file will be always overwritten on the same 
original bucket.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-s3</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version\}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
