== AWS S3 Storage Service Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.8*

The S3 component supports storing and retrieving objects from/to
http://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon's S3] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon S3. More information are available at
http://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon S3].

### URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws-s3://bucketNameOrArn[?options]
------------------------------

The bucket will be created if it don't already exists. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

For example in order to read file `hello.txt` from bucket `helloBucket`, use the following snippet:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-s3:helloBucket?accessKey=yourAccessKey&secretKey=yourSecretKey&prefix=hello.txt")
  .to("file:/var/downloaded");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AWS S3 Storage Service endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-s3:bucketNameOrArn
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bucketNameOrArn* | *Required* Bucket name or ARN |  | String
|===


==== Query Parameters (50 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonS3Client* (common) | Reference to a com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3 in the link:registry.htmlRegistry. |  | AmazonS3
| *pathStyleAccess* (common) | Whether or not the S3 client should use path style access | false | boolean
| *policy* (common) | The policy for this queue to set in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3#setBucketPolicy() method. |  | String
| *proxyHost* (common) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the SQS client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (common) | Specify a proxy port to be used inside the client definition. |  | Integer
| *region* (common) | The region in which S3 client needs to work |  | String
| *useIAMCredentials* (common) | Set whether the S3 client should expect to load credentials on an EC2 instance or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | boolean
| *encryptionMaterials* (common) | The encryption materials to use in case of Symmetric/Asymmetric client usage |  | EncryptionMaterials
| *useEncryption* (common) | Define if encryption must be used or not | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *deleteAfterRead* (consumer) | Delete objects from S3 after they have been retrieved. The delete is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not deleted. If this option is false, then the same objects will be retrieve over and over again on the polls. Therefore you need to use the Idempotent Consumer EIP in the route to filter out duplicates. You can filter using the S3Constants#BUCKET_NAME and S3Constants#KEY headers, or only the S3Constants#KEY header. | true | boolean
| *fileName* (consumer) | To get the object from the bucket with the given file name |  | String
| *includeBody* (consumer) | If it is true, the exchange body will be set to a stream to the contents of the file. If false, the headers will be set with the S3 object metadata, but the body will be null. This option is strongly related to autocloseBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true and autocloseBody to false, it will be up to the caller to close the S3Object stream. Setting autocloseBody to true, will close the S3Object stream automatically. | true | boolean
| *maxConnections* (consumer) | Set the maxConnections parameter in the S3 client configuration | 60 | int
| *maxMessagesPerPoll* (consumer) | Gets the maximum number of messages as a limit to poll at each polling. Is default unlimited, but use 0 or negative number to disable it as unlimited. | 10 | int
| *prefix* (consumer) | The prefix which is used in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ListObjectsRequest to only consume objects we are interested in. |  | String
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *autocloseBody* (consumer) | If this option is true and includeBody is true, then the S3Object.close() method will be called on exchange completion. This option is strongly related to includeBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true and autocloseBody to false, it will be up to the caller to close the S3Object stream. Setting autocloseBody to true, will close the S3Object stream automatically. | true | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPoll Strategy

| *awsKMSKeyId* (producer) | Define the id of KMS key to use in case KMS is enabled |  | String
| *useAwsKMS* (producer) | Define if KMS must be used or not | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *accelerateModeEnabled* ( advanced) | Define if Accelerate Mode enabled is true or false | false | boolean

Required S3 component options

You have to provide the amazonS3Client in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the http://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon's S3].

### Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

#### S3 Producer operations

Camel-AWS s3 component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- copyObject
- deleteObject
- listBuckets
- deleteBucket
- downloadLink
- listObjects

#### Advanced AmazonS3 configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the `AmazonS3` instance configuration, you can
create your own instance:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");

ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonS3 client = new AmazonS3Client(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and refer to it in your Camel aws-s3 component configuration:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-s3://MyBucket?amazonS3Client=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Use KMS with the S3 component

To use AWS KMS to encrypt/decrypt data by using AWS infrastructure you can use the options introduced in 2.21.x like in the following example

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("file:tmp/test?fileName=test.txt")
     .setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, constant("testFile"))
     .to("aws-s3://mybucket?amazonS3Client=#client&useAwsKMS=true&awsKMSKeyId=3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll ask to S3, to use the KMS key 3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c, to encrypt the file test.txt. When you'll ask to download this file, the decryption will be done directly before the download.

#### Use "useIAMCredentials" with the s3 component

To use AWS IAM credentials, you must first verify that the EC2 in which you are launching the Camel application on has an IAM role associated with it containing the appropriate policies attached to run effectively.
Keep in mind that this feature should only be set to "true" on remote instances. To clarify even further, you must still use static credentials locally since IAM is an AWS specific component,
but AWS environments should now be easier to manage. After this is implemented and understood, you can set the query parameter "useIAMCredentials" to "true" for AWS environments! To effectively toggle this
on and off based on local and remote environments, you can consider enabling this query parameter with system environment variables. For example, your code could set the "useIAMCredentials" query parameter to "true",
when the system environment variable called "isRemote" is set to true (there are many other ways to do this and this should act as a simple example). Although it doesn't take away the need for static credentials completely,
using IAM credentials on AWS environments takes away the need to refresh on remote environments and adds a major security boost (IAM credentials are refreshed automatically every 6 hours and update when their
policies are updated). This is the AWS recommended way to manage credentials and therefore should be used as often as possible.

### Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel
(2.8 or higher).
