== JT400 Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.5*

The *`jt400`* component allows you to exchanges messages with an AS/400
system using data queues.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jt400</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
jt400://user:password@system/QSYS.LIB/LIBRARY.LIB/QUEUE.DTAQ[?options]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To call remote program (*Camel 2.7*)

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
jt400://user:password@system/QSYS.LIB/LIBRARY.LIB/program.PGM[?options]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### JT400 options

### Usage

When configured as a consumer endpoint, the endpoint will poll a data
queue on a remote system. For every entry on the data queue, a new
`Exchange` is sent with the entry's data in the _In_ message's body,
formatted either as a `String` or a `byte[]`, depending on the format.
For a provider endpoint, the _In_ message body contents will be put on
the data queue as either raw bytes or text.

### Connection pool

*Available as of Camel 2.10*

Connection pooling is in use from Camel 2.10 onwards. You can explicit
configure a connection pool on the Jt400Component, or as an uri option
on the endpoint.

#### Remote program call (*Camel 2.7*)

This endpoint expects the input to be either a String array or byte[]
array (depending on format) and handles all the CCSID handling through
the native jt400 library mechanisms. A parameter can be _omitted_ by
passing null as the value in its position (the remote program has to
support it). After the program execution the endpoint returns either a
String array or byte[] array with the values as they were returned by
the program (the input only parameters will contain the same data as the
beginning of the invocation). This endpoint does not implement a provider endpoint!

### Example

In the snippet below, the data for an exchange sent to the
`direct:george` endpoint will be put in the data queue `PENNYLANE` in
library `BEATLES` on a system named `LIVERPOOL`.  +
 Another user connects to the same data queue to receive the information
from the data queue and forward it to the `mock:ringo` endpoint.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Jt400RouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
       from("direct:george").to("jt400://GEORGE:EGROEG@LIVERPOOL/QSYS.LIB/BEATLES.LIB/PENNYLANE.DTAQ");
       from("jt400://RINGO:OGNIR@LIVERPOOL/QSYS.LIB/BEATLES.LIB/PENNYLANE.DTAQ").to("mock:ringo");
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Remote program call example (*Camel 2.7*)

In the snippet below, the data Exchange sent to the direct:work endpoint
will contain three string that will be used as the arguments for the
program “compute” in the library “assets”. This program will write the
output values in the 2nd and 3rd parameters. All the parameters will be
sent to the direct:play endpoint.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Jt400RouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
       from("direct:work").to("jt400://GRUPO:ATWORK@server/QSYS.LIB/assets.LIB/compute.PGM?fieldsLength=10,10,512&ouputFieldsIdx=2,3").to(“direct:play”);
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Writing to keyed data queues

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jms:queue:input")
.to("jt400://username:password@system/lib.lib/MSGINDQ.DTAQ?keyed=true");
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Reading from keyed data queues

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jt400://username:password@system/lib.lib/MSGOUTDQ.DTAQ?keyed=true&searchKey=MYKEY&searchType=GE")
.to("jms:queue:output");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
