== CXF Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.0*

NOTE: When using Apache CXF as a consumer, the link:cxf-bean-component.html[CXF Bean
Component] allows you to factor out how message payloads are received
from their processing as a RESTful or SOAP web service. This has the
potential of using a multitude of transports to consume web services.
The bean component's configuration is also simpler and provides the
fastest method to implement web services using Camel and CXF.

TIP: When using CXF in streaming modes (see DataFormat option), then also
read about Stream caching.

The *cxf:* component provides integration with
http://cxf.apache.org[Apache CXF] for connecting to http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-ws.html[JAX-WS] services
hosted in CXF.

Maven users must add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-cxf</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------


### URI format
There are two URI formats for this endpoint: *cxfEndpoint* and *someAddress*.

[source,java]

------------------------------
cxf:bean:cxfEndpoint[?options]
------------------------------

Where *cxfEndpoint* represents a bean ID that references a bean in the
Spring bean registry. With this URI format, most of the endpoint details
are specified in the bean definition.

[source,java]
---------------------------
cxf://someAddress[?options]
---------------------------

Where *someAddress* specifies the CXF endpoint's address. With this URI
format, most of the endpoint details are specified using options.

For either style above, you can append options to the URI as follows:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
cxf:bean:cxfEndpoint?wsdlURL=wsdl/hello_world.wsdl&dataFormat=PAYLOAD
---------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Descriptions of the dataformats
In Apache Camel, the Camel CXF component is the key to integrating routes with Web services. You can use the Camel CXF component to create a CXF endpoint, which can be used in either of the following ways:

* *Consumer* — (at the start of a route) represents a Web service instance, which integrates with the route. The type of payload injected into the route depends on the value of the endpoint's dataFormat option.
* *Producer* — (at other points in the route) represents a WS client proxy, which converts the current exchange object into an operation invocation on a remote Web service. The format of the current exchange must match the endpoint's dataFormat setting. 

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|DataFormat |Description

|`POJO` |POJOs (Plain old Java objects) are the Java parameters to the method
being invoked on the target server. Both Protocol and Logical JAX-WS
handlers are supported.

|`PAYLOAD` |`PAYLOAD` is the message payload (the contents of the `soap:body`) after
message configuration in the CXF endpoint is applied. Only Protocol
JAX-WS handler is supported. Logical JAX-WS handler is not supported.

|`MESSAGE` |`MESSAGE` is the raw message that is received from the transport layer.
It is not suppose to touch or change Stream, some of the CXF
interceptors will be removed if you are using this kind of DataFormat so
you can't see any soap headers after the camel-cxf consumer and JAX-WS
handler is not supported.

|`CXF_MESSAGE` |New in *Camel 2.8.2*, `CXF_MESSAGE` allows for invoking the full
capabilities of CXF interceptors by converting the message from the
transport layer into a raw SOAP message
|=======================================================================

You can determine the data format mode of an exchange by retrieving the
exchange property, `CamelCXFDataFormat`. The exchange key constant is
defined in
`org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfConstants.DATA_FORMAT_PROPERTY`.

[[CXF-HowtoenableCXFLoggingOutInterceptorinMESSAGEmode]]
How to enable CXF's LoggingOutInterceptor in MESSAGE mode

CXF's `LoggingOutInterceptor` outputs outbound message that goes on the
wire to logging system (Java Util Logging). Since the
`LoggingOutInterceptor` is in `PRE_STREAM` phase (but `PRE_STREAM` phase
is removed in `MESSAGE` mode), you have to configure
`LoggingOutInterceptor` to be run during the `WRITE` phase. The
following is an example.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="loggingOutInterceptor" class="org.apache.cxf.interceptor.LoggingOutInterceptor">
    <!--  it really should have been user-prestream but CXF does have such phase! -->
    <constructor-arg value="target/write"/> 
</bean>
         
<cxf:cxfEndpoint id="serviceEndpoint" address="http://localhost:${CXFTestSupport.port2}/LoggingInterceptorInMessageModeTest/helloworld"
    serviceClass="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.HelloService">
    <cxf:outInterceptors>
        <ref bean="loggingOutInterceptor"/>
    </cxf:outInterceptors>
    <cxf:properties>
        <entry key="dataFormat" value="MESSAGE"/>
    </cxf:properties>
</cxf:cxfEndpoint>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Description of relayHeaders option

There are _in-band_ and _out-of-band_ on-the-wire headers from the
perspective of a JAXWS WSDL-first developer.

The _in-band_ headers are headers that are explicitly defined as part of
the WSDL binding contract for an endpoint such as SOAP headers.

The _out-of-band_ headers are headers that are serialized over the wire,
but are not explicitly part of the WSDL binding contract.

Headers relaying/filtering is bi-directional.

When a route has a CXF endpoint and the developer needs to have
on-the-wire headers, such as SOAP headers, be relayed along the route to
be consumed say by another JAXWS endpoint, then `relayHeaders` should be
set to `true`, which is the default value.

[[CXF-AvailableonlyinPOJOmode]]
Available only in POJO mode

The `relayHeaders=true` express an intent to relay the headers. The
actual decision on whether a given header is relayed is delegated to a
pluggable instance that implements the `MessageHeadersRelay` interface.
A concrete implementation of `MessageHeadersRelay` will be consulted to
decide if a header needs to be relayed or not. There is already an
implementation of `SoapMessageHeadersRelay` which binds itself to
well-known SOAP name spaces. Currently only out-of-band headers are
filtered, and in-band headers will always be relayed when
`relayHeaders=true`. If there is a header on the wire, whose name space
is unknown to the runtime, then a fall back `DefaultMessageHeadersRelay`
will be used, which simply allows all headers to be relayed.

The `relayHeaders=false` setting asserts that all headers in-band and
out-of-band will be dropped.

You can plugin your own `MessageHeadersRelay` implementations overriding
or adding additional ones to the list of relays. In order to override a
preloaded relay instance just make sure that your `MessageHeadersRelay`
implementation services the same name spaces as the one you looking to
override. Also note, that the overriding relay has to service all of the
name spaces as the one you looking to override, or else a runtime
exception on route start up will be thrown as this would introduce an
ambiguity in name spaces to relay instance mappings.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<cxf:cxfEndpoint ...>
   <cxf:properties>
     <entry key="org.apache.camel.cxf.message.headers.relays">

Take a look at the tests that show how you'd be able to relay/drop
headers here:

https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-cxf/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/cxf/soap/headers/CxfMessageHeadersRelayTest.java[https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-cxf/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/cxf/soap/headers/CxfMessageHeadersRelayTest.java]

[[CXF-ChangessinceRelease2.0]]
Changes since Camel Release  2.0

* `POJO` and `PAYLOAD` modes are supported. In `POJO` mode, only
out-of-band message headers are available for filtering as the in-band
headers have been processed and removed from header list by CXF. The
in-band headers are incorporated into the `MessageContentList` in POJO
mode. The `camel-cxf` component does make any attempt to remove the
in-band headers from the `MessageContentList`. If filtering of in-band
headers is required, please use `PAYLOAD` mode or plug in a (pretty
straightforward) CXF interceptor/JAXWS Handler to the CXF endpoint.
* The Message Header Relay mechanism has been merged into
`CxfHeaderFilterStrategy`. The `relayHeaders` option, its semantics, and
default value remain the same, but it is a property of
`CxfHeaderFilterStrategy`. 
 Here is an example of configuring it.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="dropAllMessageHeadersStrategy" class="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.common.header.CxfHeaderFilterStrategy">
 
    <!--  Set relayHeaders to false to drop all SOAP headers -->
    <property name="relayHeaders" value="false"/>
     
</bean>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, your endpoint can reference the `CxfHeaderFilterStrategy`.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="cxf:bean:routerNoRelayEndpoint?headerFilterStrategy=#dropAllMessageHeadersStrategy"/>          
    <to uri="cxf:bean:serviceNoRelayEndpoint?headerFilterStrategy=#dropAllMessageHeadersStrategy"/>
</route>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The `MessageHeadersRelay` interface has changed slightly and has been
renamed to `MessageHeaderFilter`. It is a property of
`CxfHeaderFilterStrategy`. Here is an example of configuring user
defined Message Header Filters:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="customMessageFilterStrategy" class="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.common.header.CxfHeaderFilterStrategy">
    <property name="messageHeaderFilters">
        <list>
            <!--  SoapMessageHeaderFilter is the built in filter.  It can be removed by omitting it. -->
            <bean class="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.common.header.SoapMessageHeaderFilter"/>
             
            <!--  Add custom filter here -->   
            <bean class="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.soap.headers.CustomHeaderFilter"/>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Other than `relayHeaders`, there are new properties that can be
configured in `CxfHeaderFilterStrategy`.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Required |Description
|`relayHeaders` |No |All message headers will be processed by Message Header Filters  
 _Type_: `boolean`  
 _Default_: `true`

|`relayAllMessageHeaders` | No |All message headers will be propagated (without processing by Message
Header Filters)  
 _Type_: `boolean`  
 _Default_: `false`

|`allowFilterNamespaceClash` |No |If two filters overlap in activation namespace, the property control how
it should be handled. If the value is `true`, last one wins. If the
value is `false`, it will throw an exception  
 _Type_: `boolean`  
 _Default_: `false`
|=======================================================================

### Configure the CXF endpoints with Spring

You can configure the CXF endpoint with the Spring configuration file
shown below, and you can also embed the endpoint into the `camelContext`
tags. When you are invoking the service endpoint, you can set the
`operationName` and `operationNamespace` headers to explicitly state
which operation you are calling.

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    </camelContext>
  </beans>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to include the JAX-WS `schemaLocation` attribute specified on
the root beans element. This allows CXF to validate the file and is
required. Also note the namespace declarations at the end of the
`<cxf:cxfEndpoint/>` tag. These declarations are required because the combined `{namespace}localName` syntax is presently not supported for this tag's
attribute values.

The `cxf:cxfEndpoint` element supports many additional attributes:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Value

|`PortName` |The endpoint name this service is implementing, it maps to the
`wsdl:port@name`. In the format of `ns:PORT_NAME` where `ns` is a
namespace prefix valid at this scope.

|`serviceName` |The service name this service is implementing, it maps to the
`wsdl:service@name`. In the format of `ns:SERVICE_NAME` where `ns` is a
namespace prefix valid at this scope.

|`wsdlURL` |The location of the WSDL. Can be on the classpath, file system, or be
hosted remotely.

|`bindingId` |The `bindingId` for the service model to use.

|`address` |The service publish address.

|`bus` |The bus name that will be used in the JAX-WS endpoint.

|`serviceClass` |The class name of the SEI (Service Endpoint Interface) class which could
have JSR181 annotation or not.
|=======================================================================

It also supports many child elements:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Value

|`cxf:inInterceptors` |The incoming interceptors for this endpoint. A list of `<bean>` or
`<ref>`.

|`cxf:properties` | A properties map which should be supplied to the JAX-WS endpoint. See
below.

|`cxf:handlers` |A JAX-WS handler list which should be supplied to the JAX-WS endpoint.
See below.

|`cxf:dataBinding` |You can specify the which `DataBinding` will be use in the endpoint.
This can be supplied using the Spring `<bean class="MyDataBinding"/>`
syntax.

|`cxf:binding` |You can specify the `BindingFactory` for this endpoint to use. This can
be supplied using the Spring `<bean class="MyBindingFactory"/>` syntax.

|`cxf:features` |The features that hold the interceptors for this endpoint. A list of
beans or refs

|`cxf:schemaLocations` |The schema locations for endpoint to use. A list of schemaLocations

You can find more advanced examples that show how to provide
interceptors, properties and handlers on the CXF
http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-ws-configuration.html[JAX-WS
Configuration page].

*NOTE* 
 You can use cxf:properties to set the camel-cxf endpoint's dataFormat
and setDefaultBus properties from spring configuration file.

### Configuring the CXF Endpoints with Apache Aries Blueprint

Since Camel 2.8 there is support for utilizing aries blueprint
dependency injection for your CXF endpoints. 
 The schema utilized is very similar to the spring schema so the
transition is fairly transparent.

Example

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to make the camel-cxf component use log4j instead of java.util.logging

CXF's default logger is `java.util.logging`. If you want to change it to
log4j, proceed as follows. Create a file, in the classpath, named
`META-INF/cxf/org.apache.cxf.logger`. This file should contain the
fully-qualified name of the class,
`org.apache.cxf.common.logging.Log4jLogger`, with no comments, on a
single line.

### How to let camel-cxf response message with xml start document

If you are using some SOAP client such as PHP, you will get this kind of
error, because CXF doesn't add the XML start document "<?xml
version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>"

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error:sendSms: SoapFault exception: [Client] looks like we got no XML document in [...]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To resolved this issue, you just need to tell StaxOutInterceptor to
write the XML start document for you.

You can add a customer interceptor like this and configure it into you
camel-cxf endpont

Or adding a message header for it like this if you are using *Camel
2.4*.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 // set up the response context which force start document
 Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();
 map.put("org.apache.cxf.stax.force-start-document", Boolean.TRUE);
 exchange.getOut().setHeader(Client.RESPONSE_CONTEXT, map);
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to override the CXF producer address from message header

The `camel-cxf` producer supports to override the services address by
setting the message with the key of "CamelDestinationOverrideUrl".

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 // set up the service address from the message header to override the setting of CXF endpoint
 exchange.getIn().setHeader(Exchange.DESTINATION_OVERRIDE_URL, constant(getServiceAddress()));
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to consume a message from a camel-cxf endpoint in POJO data format

The `camel-cxf` endpoint consumer POJO data format is based on the
http://cxf.apache.org/docs/invokers.html[CXF invoker], so the
message header has a property with the name of
`CxfConstants.OPERATION_NAME` and the message body is a list of the SEI
method parameters.

### How to prepare the message for the camel-cxf endpoint in POJO data format

The `camel-cxf` endpoint producer is based on the
https://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/endpoint/Client.java[CXF
client API]. First you need to specify the operation name in the message
header, then add the method parameters to a list, and initialize the
message with this parameter list. The response message's body is a
messageContentsList, you can get the result from that list.

If you don't specify the operation name in the message header,
`CxfProducer` will try to use the `defaultOperationName `from
`CxfEndpoint`, if there is no `defaultOperationName` set on
`CxfEndpoint`, it will pickup the first operationName from the Operation
list.

If you want to get the object array from the message body, you can get
the body using `message.getbody(Object[].class)`, as follows:

### How to deal with the message for a camel-cxf endpoint in PAYLOAD data format

`PAYLOAD` means that you process the payload message from the SOAP
envelope. You can use the `Header.HEADER_LIST` as the key to set or get
the SOAP headers and use the `List<Element>` to set or get SOAP body
elements. 
 `Message.getBody()` will return an
`org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfPayload` object, which has getters
for SOAP message headers and Body elements. This change enables
decoupling the native CXF message from the Camel message.

### How to get and set SOAP headers in POJO mode

`POJO` means that the data format is a "list of Java objects" when the
Camel-cxf endpoint produces or consumes Camel exchanges. Even though
Camel expose message body as POJOs in this mode, Camel-cxf still
provides access to read and write SOAP headers. However, since CXF
interceptors remove in-band SOAP headers from Header list after they
have been processed, only out-of-band SOAP headers are available to
Camel-cxf in POJO mode.

The following example illustrate how to get/set SOAP headers. Suppose we
have a route that forwards from one Camel-cxf endpoint to another. That
is, SOAP Client -> Camel -> CXF service. We can attach two processors to
obtain/insert SOAP headers at (1) before request goes out to the CXF
service and (2) before response comes back to the SOAP Client. Processor
(1) and (2) in this example are InsertRequestOutHeaderProcessor and
InsertResponseOutHeaderProcessor. Our route looks like this:

SOAP headers are propagated to and from Camel Message headers. The Camel
message header name is "org.apache.cxf.headers.Header.list" which is a
constant defined in CXF (org.apache.cxf.headers.Header.HEADER_LIST). The
header value is a List of CXF SoapHeader objects
(org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.SoapHeader). The following snippet is the
InsertResponseOutHeaderProcessor (that insert a new SOAP header in the
response message). The way to access SOAP headers in both
InsertResponseOutHeaderProcessor and InsertRequestOutHeaderProcessor are
actually the same. The only difference between the two processors is
setting the direction of the inserted SOAP header.

### How to get and set SOAP headers in PAYLOAD mode

We've already shown how to access SOAP message (CxfPayload object) in
PAYLOAD mode (See "How to deal with the message for a camel-cxf endpoint
in PAYLOAD data format").

Once you obtain a CxfPayload object, you can invoke the
CxfPayload.getHeaders() method that returns a List of DOM Elements (SOAP
headers).

Since Camel 2.16.0, you can also use the same way as described in
sub-chapter "How to get and set SOAP headers in POJO mode" to set or get
the SOAP headers. So, you can use now the
header "org.apache.cxf.headers.Header.list" to get and set a list of
SOAP headers.This does also mean that if you have a route that forwards
from one Camel-cxf endpoint to another (SOAP Client -> Camel -> CXF
service), now also the SOAP headers sent by the SOAP client are
forwarded to the CXF service. If you do not want that these headers are
forwarded you have to remove them in the Camel header
"org.apache.cxf.headers.Header.list".

### SOAP headers are not available in MESSAGE mode

SOAP headers are not available in MESSAGE mode as SOAP processing is
skipped.

### How to throw a SOAP Fault from Camel

If you are using a `camel-cxf` endpoint to consume the SOAP request, you
may need to throw the SOAP Fault from the camel context. +
 Basically, you can use the `throwFault` DSL to do that; it works for
`POJO`, `PAYLOAD` and `MESSAGE` data format. +
 You can define the soap fault like this

Then throw it as you like

If your CXF endpoint is working in the `MESSAGE` data format, you could
set the SOAP Fault message in the message body and set the response
code in the message header.

Same for using POJO data format. You can set the SOAPFault on the out
body and also indicate it's a fault by calling Message.setFault(true):

### How to propagate a camel-cxf endpoint's request and response context

https://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/endpoint/Client.java[CXF
client API] provides a way to invoke the operation with request and
response context. If you are using a `camel-cxf` endpoint producer to
invoke the outside web service, you can set the request context and get
response context with the following code:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        CxfExchange exchange = (CxfExchange)template.send(getJaxwsEndpointUri(), new Processor() {
             public void process(final Exchange exchange) {
                 final List<String> params = new ArrayList<String>();
                 params.add(TEST_MESSAGE);
                 // Set the request context to the inMessage
                 Map<String, Object> requestContext = new HashMap<String, Object>();
                 requestContext.put(BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, JAXWS_SERVER_ADDRESS);
                 exchange.getIn().setBody(params);
                 exchange.getIn().setHeader(Client.REQUEST_CONTEXT , requestContext);
                 exchange.getIn().setHeader(CxfConstants.OPERATION_NAME, GREET_ME_OPERATION);
             }
         });
         org.apache.camel.Message out = exchange.getOut();
         // The output is an object array, the first element of the array is the return value
         Object\[\] output = out.getBody(Object\[\].class);
         LOG.info("Received output text: " + output\[0\]);
         // Get the response context form outMessage
         Map<String, Object> responseContext = CastUtils.cast((Map)out.getHeader(Client.RESPONSE_CONTEXT));
         assertNotNull(responseContext);
         assertEquals("Get the wrong wsdl operation name", "{http://apache.org/hello_world_soap_http}greetMe",
                      responseContext.get("javax.xml.ws.wsdl.operation").toString());
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Attachment Support

*POJO Mode:* Both SOAP with Attachment and MTOM are supported (see
example in Payload Mode for enabling MTOM).  However, SOAP with
Attachment is not tested.  Since attachments are marshalled and
unmarshalled into POJOs, users typically do not need to deal with the
attachment themself.  Attachments are propagated to Camel message's
attachments if the MTOM is not enabled, since Camel 2.12.3.  So, it is
possible to retrieve attachments by Camel Message API

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
DataHandler Message.getAttachment(String id)
--------------------------------------------

*Payload Mode:* MTOM is supported since Camel 2.1. Attachments can be
retrieved by Camel Message APIs mentioned above. SOAP with Attachment
(SwA) is supported and attachments can be retrieved since Camel  2.5. SwA is
the default (same as setting the CXF endpoint property "mtom-enabled" to
false). 

To enable MTOM, set the CXF endpoint property "mtom-enabled" to _true_.
(I believe you can only do it with Spring.)

You can produce a Camel message with attachment to send to a CXF
endpoint in Payload mode.

You can also consume a Camel message received from a CXF endpoint in
Payload mode.

*Message Mode:* Attachments are not supported as it does not process the
message at all.

*CXF_MESSAGE Mode*: MTOM is supported, and Attachments can be retrieved
by Camel Message APIs mentioned above. Note that when receiving a
multipart (i.e. MTOM) message the default SOAPMessage to String
converter will provide the complete multipart payload on the body. If
you require just the SOAP XML as a String, you can set the message body
with message.getSOAPPart(), and Camel convert can do the rest of work
for you.

### Streaming Support in PAYLOAD mode

In Camel 2.8.2, the camel-cxf component now supports streaming of incoming
messages when using PAYLOAD mode. Previously, the incoming messages
would have been completely DOM parsed. For large messages, this is time
consuming and uses a significant amount of memory. Starting in Camel 2.8.2,
the incoming messages can remain as a javax.xml.transform.Source while
being routed and, if nothing modifies the payload, can then be directly
streamed out to the target destination. For common "simple proxy" use
cases (example: from("cxf:...").to("cxf:...")), this can provide very
significant performance increases as well as significantly lowered
memory requirements.

However, there are cases where streaming may not be appropriate or
desired. Due to the streaming nature, invalid incoming XML may not be
caught until later in the processing chain. Also, certain actions may
require the message to be DOM parsed anyway (like WS-Security or message
tracing and such) in which case the advantages of the streaming is
limited. At this point, there are two ways to control the streaming:

* Endpoint property: you can add "allowStreaming=false" as an endpoint
property to turn the streaming on/off.

* Component property: the CxfComponent object also has an allowStreaming
property that can set the default for endpoints created from that
component.

Global system property: you can add a system property of
"org.apache.camel.component.cxf.streaming" to "false" to turn if off.
That sets the global default, but setting the endpoint property above
will override this value for that endpoint.

### Using the generic CXF Dispatch mode

From Camel 2.8.0, the camel-cxf component supports the generic
https://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-ws-dispatch-api.html[CXF dispatch
mode] that can transport messages of arbitrary structures (i.e., not
bound to a specific XML schema). To use this mode, you simply omit
specifying the wsdlURL and serviceClass attributes of the CXF endpoint.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<cxf:cxfEndpoint id="testEndpoint" address="http://localhost:9000/SoapContext/SoapAnyPort">
     <cxf:properties>
       <entry key="dataFormat" value="PAYLOAD"/>
     </cxf:properties>
   </cxf:cxfEndpoint>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is noted that the default CXF dispatch client does not send a
specific SOAPAction header. Therefore, when the target service requires
a specific SOAPAction value, it is supplied in the Camel header using
the key SOAPAction (case-insensitive).
