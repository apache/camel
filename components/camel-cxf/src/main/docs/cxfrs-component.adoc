## CXF-RS Component

The *cxfrs:* component provides integration with
http://cxf.apache.org[Apache CXF] for connecting to JAX-RS 1.1 and 2.0
services hosted in CXF.

When using CXF as a consumer, the link:cxf-bean-component.html[CXF Bean
Component] allows you to factor out how message payloads are received
from their processing as a RESTful or SOAP web service. This has the
potential of using a multitude of transports to consume web services.
The bean component's configuration is also simpler and provides the
fastest method to implement web services using Camel and CXF.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
   <artifactId>camel-cxf</artifactId>
   <version>x.x.x</version>  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------
cxfrs://address?options
-----------------------

Where *address* represents the CXF endpoint's address

[source,java]
---------------------
cxfrs:bean:rsEndpoint
---------------------

Where *rsEndpoint* represents the spring bean's name which presents the
CXFRS client or server

For either style above, you can append options to the URI as follows:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------
cxfrs:bean:cxfEndpoint?resourceClasses=org.apache.camel.rs.Example
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Options



// component options: START
The CXF-RS component supports 1 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| headerFilterStrategy | filter |  | HeaderFilterStrategy | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message.
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The CXF-RS component supports 31 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| beanId | common |  | String | To lookup an existing configured CxfRsEndpoint. Must used bean: as prefix.
| address | common |  | String | The service publish address.
| features | common |  | List | Set the feature list to the CxfRs endpoint.
| loggingFeatureEnabled | common | false | boolean | This option enables CXF Logging Feature which writes inbound and outbound REST messages to log.
| loggingSizeLimit | common |  | int | To limit the total size of number of bytes the logger will output when logging feature has been enabled.
| modelRef | common |  | String | This option is used to specify the model file which is useful for the resource class without annotation. When using this option then the service class can be omitted to emulate document-only endpoints
| providers | common |  | String | Set custom JAX-RS provider(s) list to the CxfRs endpoint. You can specify a string with a list of providers to lookup in the registy separated by comma.
| resourceClasses | common |  | List | The resource classes which you want to export as REST service. Multiple classes can be separated by comma.
| schemaLocations | common |  | List | Sets the locations of the schema(s) which can be used to validate the incoming XML or JAXB-driven JSON.
| skipFaultLogging | common | false | boolean | This option controls whether the PhaseInterceptorChain skips logging the Fault that it catches.
| bindingStyle | consumer | Default | BindingStyle | Sets how requests and responses will be mapped to/from Camel. Two values are possible: SimpleConsumer: This binding style processes request parameters multiparts etc. and maps them to IN headers IN attachments and to the message body. It aims to eliminate low-level processing of org.apache.cxf.message.MessageContentsList. It also also adds more flexibility and simplicity to the response mapping. Only available for consumers. Default: The default style. For consumers this passes on a MessageContentsList to the route requiring low-level processing in the route. This is the traditional binding style which simply dumps the org.apache.cxf.message.MessageContentsList coming in from the CXF stack onto the IN message body. The user is then responsible for processing it according to the contract defined by the JAX-RS method signature. Custom: allows you to specify a custom binding through the binding option.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| publishedEndpointUrl | consumer |  | String | This option can override the endpointUrl that published from the WADL which can be accessed with resource address url plus _wadl
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.
| cookieHandler | producer |  | CookieHandler | Configure a cookie handler to maintain a HTTP session
| hostnameVerifier | producer |  | HostnameVerifier | The hostname verifier to be used. Use the notation to reference a HostnameVerifier from the registry.
| sslContextParameters | producer |  | SSLContextParameters | The Camel SSL setting reference. Use the notation to reference the SSL Context.
| throwExceptionOnFailure | producer | true | boolean | This option tells the CxfRsProducer to inspect return codes and will generate an Exception if the return code is larger than 207.
| httpClientAPI | producer (advanced) | true | boolean | If it is true the CxfRsProducer will use the HttpClientAPI to invoke the service. If it is false the CxfRsProducer will use the ProxyClientAPI to invoke the service
| ignoreDeleteMethodMessageBody | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | This option is used to tell CxfRsProducer to ignore the message body of the DELETE method when using HTTP API.
| maxClientCacheSize | producer (advanced) | 10 | int | This option allows you to configure the maximum size of the cache. The implementation caches CXF clients or ClientFactoryBean in CxfProvider and CxfRsProvider.
| binding | advanced |  | CxfRsBinding | To use a custom CxfBinding to control the binding between Camel Message and CXF Message.
| bus | advanced |  | Bus | To use a custom configured CXF Bus.
| continuationTimeout | advanced | 30000 | long | This option is used to set the CXF continuation timeout which could be used in CxfConsumer by default when the CXF server is using Jetty or Servlet transport.
| cxfRsEndpointConfigurer | advanced |  | CxfRsEndpointConfigurer | This option could apply the implementation of org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxrs.CxfRsEndpointConfigurer which supports to configure the CXF endpoint in programmatic way. User can configure the CXF server and client by implementing configureServer/Client method of CxfEndpointConfigurer.
| defaultBus | advanced | false | boolean | Will set the default bus when CXF endpoint create a bus by itself
| headerFilterStrategy | advanced |  | HeaderFilterStrategy | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message.
| performInvocation | advanced | false | boolean | When the option is true Camel will perform the invocation of the resource class instance and put the response object into the exchange for further processing.
| propagateContexts | advanced | false | boolean | When the option is true JAXRS UriInfo HttpHeaders Request and SecurityContext contexts will be available to custom CXFRS processors as typed Camel exchange properties. These contexts can be used to analyze the current requests using JAX-RS API.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).

You can also configure the CXF REST endpoint through the spring
configuration. Since there are lots of difference between the CXF REST
client and CXF REST Server, we provide different configuration for
them. Please check out the
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-cxf/src/main/resources/schema/cxfEndpoint.xsd[schema
file] and https://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/JAX-RS[CXF JAX-RS
documentation] for more information.

### How to configure the REST endpoint in Camel

In
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-cxf/src/main/resources/schema/cxfEndpoint.xsd[camel-cxf
schema file], there are two elements for the REST endpoint definition.
*cxf:rsServer* for REST consumer, *cxf:rsClient* for REST producer. +
 You can find a Camel REST service route configuration example here.

### How to override the CXF producer address from message header

The `camel-cxfrs` producer supports to override the services address by
setting the message with the key of "CamelDestinationOverrideUrl".

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 // set up the service address from the message header to override the setting of CXF endpoint
 exchange.getIn().setHeader(Exchange.DESTINATION_OVERRIDE_URL, constant(getServiceAddress()));
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Consuming a REST Request - Simple Binding Style

*Available as of Camel 2.11*

The `Default` binding style is rather low-level, requiring the user to
manually process the `MessageContentsList` object coming into the route.
Thus, it tightly couples the route logic with the method signature and
parameter indices of the JAX-RS operation. Somewhat inelegant, difficult
and error-prone.

In contrast, the `SimpleConsumer` binding style performs the following
mappings, in order to *make the request data more accessible* to you
within the Camel Message:

* JAX-RS Parameters (@HeaderParam, @QueryParam, etc.) are injected as IN
message headers. The header name matches the value of the annotation.
* The request entity (POJO or other type) becomes the IN message body.
If a single entity cannot be identified in the JAX-RS method signature,
it falls back to the original `MessageContentsList`.
* Binary `@Multipart` body parts become IN message attachments,
supporting `DataHandler`, `InputStream`, `DataSource` and CXF's
`Attachment` class.
* Non-binary `@Multipart` body parts are mapped as IN message headers.
The header name matches the Body Part name.

Additionally, the following rules apply to the *Response mapping*:

* If the message body type is different to `javax.ws.rs.core.Response`
(user-built response), a new `Response` is created and the message body
is set as the entity (so long it's not null). The response status code
is taken from the `Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE` header, or defaults to
200 OK if not present.
* If the message body type is equal to `javax.ws.rs.core.Response`, it
means that the user has built a custom response, and therefore it is
respected and it becomes the final response.
* In all cases, Camel headers permitted by custom or default
`HeaderFilterStrategy` are added to the HTTP response.

#### Enabling the Simple Binding Style

This binding style can be activated by setting the `bindingStyle`
parameter in the consumer endpoint to value `SimpleConsumer`:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
  from("cxfrs:bean:rsServer?bindingStyle=SimpleConsumer")
    .to("log:TEST?showAll=true");
---------------------------------------------------------

#### Examples of request binding with different method signatures

Below is a list of method signatures along with the expected result from
the Simple binding.

*`public Response doAction(BusinessObject request);`* +
 Request payload is placed in IN message body, replacing the original
MessageContentsList.

*`public Response doAction(BusinessObject request, @HeaderParam("abcd") String abcd, @QueryParam("defg") String defg);`* 
 Request payload placed in IN message body, replacing the original
MessageContentsList. Both request params mapped as IN message headers
with names abcd and defg.

*`public Response doAction(@HeaderParam("abcd") String abcd, @QueryParam("defg") String defg);`* 
 Both request params mapped as IN message headers with names abcd and
defg. The original MessageContentsList is preserved, even though it only
contains the 2 parameters.

*`public Response doAction(@Multipart(value="body1") BusinessObject request, @Multipart(value="body2") BusinessObject request2);`* 
 The first parameter is transferred as a header with name body1, and the
second one is mapped as header body2. The original MessageContentsList
is preserved as the IN message body.

*`public Response doAction(InputStream abcd);`* 
 The InputStream is unwrapped from the MessageContentsList and preserved
as the IN message body.

*`public Response doAction(DataHandler abcd);`* 
 The DataHandler is unwrapped from the MessageContentsList and preserved
as the IN message body.

#### More examples of the Simple Binding Style

Given a JAX-RS resource class with this method:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    @POST @Path("/customers/{type}")
    public Response newCustomer(Customer customer, @PathParam("type") String type, @QueryParam("active") @DefaultValue("true") boolean active) {
        return null;
    }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Serviced by the following route:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    from("cxfrs:bean:rsServer?bindingStyle=SimpleConsumer")
        .recipientList(simple("direct:${header.operationName}"));

    from("direct:newCustomer")
        .log("Request: type=${header.type}, active=${header.active}, customerData=${body}");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following HTTP request with XML payload (given that the Customer DTO
is JAXB-annotated):

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------
POST /customers/gold?active=true

Payload:
<Customer>
  <fullName>Raul Kripalani</fullName>
  <country>Spain</country>
  <project>Apache Camel</project>
</Customer>
-------------------------------------

Will print the message:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Request: type=gold, active=true, customerData=<Customer.toString() representation>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more examples on how to process requests and write responses can be

### Consuming a REST Request - Default Binding Style

The https://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/JAX-RS[CXF JAXRS front end]
implements the https://jsr311.java.net/[JAX-RS (JSR-311) API], so we can
export the resources classes as a REST service. And we leverage the
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CXF20DOC/Invokers[CXF Invoker
API] to turn a REST request into a normal Java object method
invocation. +
 Unlike the link:restlet.html[Camel Restlet] component, you don't need
to specify the URI template within your endpoint, CXF takes care of the
REST request URI to resource class method mapping according to the
JSR-311 specification. All you need to do in Camel is delegate this
method request to a right processor or endpoint.

Here is an example of a CXFRS route...

And the corresponding resource class used to configure the endpoint...

INFO:*Note about resource classes*

By default, JAX-RS resource classes are *only*used to configure JAX-RS
properties. Methods will *not* be executed during routing of messages to
the endpoint. Instead, it is the responsibility of the route to do all
processing.

Note that starting from Camel 2.15 it is also sufficient to provide an
interface only as opposed to a no-op service implementation class for
the default mode.

Starting from Camel 2.15, if a *performInvocation* option is enabled,
the service implementation will be invoked first, the response will be
set on the Camel exchange and the route execution will continue as
usual. This can be useful for integrating the existing JAX-RS implementations into Camel routes and
for post-processing JAX-RS Responses in custom processors.

### How to invoke the REST service through camel-cxfrs producer

The https://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/JAX-RS[CXF JAXRS front end]
implements
https://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/JAX-RS+Client+API#JAX-RSClientAPI-Proxy-basedAPI[a
proxy-based client API], with this API you can invoke the remote REST
service through a proxy. The `camel-cxfrs` producer is based on this
https://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/JAX-RS+Client+API#JAX-RSClientAPI-Proxy-basedAPI[proxy
API]. +
 You just need to specify the operation name in the message header and
prepare the parameter in the message body, the camel-cxfrs producer will
generate right REST request for you.

Here is an example:

The https://cwiki.apache.org/CXF20DOC/JAX-RS[CXF JAXRS front end] also
provides
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CXF20DOC/JAX-RS+Client+API#JAX-RSClientAPI-CXFWebClientAPI[a
http centric client API]. You can also invoke this API from
`camel-cxfrs` producer. You need to specify the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Exchange.html#HTTP_PATH[HTTP_PATH]
and
the http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Exchange.html#HTTP_METHOD[HTTP_METHOD] and
let the producer use the http centric client API by using the URI option
*httpClientAPI* or by setting the message header
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-cxf/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/cxf/CxfConstants.html#CAMEL_CXF_RS_USING_HTTP_API[CxfConstants.CAMEL_CXF_RS_USING_HTTP_API].
You can turn the response object to the type class specified with the
message
header http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-cxf/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/cxf/CxfConstants.html#CAMEL_CXF_RS_RESPONSE_CLASS[CxfConstants.CAMEL_CXF_RS_RESPONSE_CLASS].

From Camel 2.1, we also support to specify the query parameters from
cxfrs URI for the CXFRS http centric client.

Error formatting macro: snippet: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException:
Index: 20, Size: 20

To support the Dynamical routing, you can override the URI's query
parameters by using the CxfConstants.CAMEL_CXF_RS_QUERY_MAP header to
set the parameter map for it.
