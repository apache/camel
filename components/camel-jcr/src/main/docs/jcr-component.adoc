== JCR Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.3*

The *`jcr`* component allows you to add/read nodes to/from a JCR
compliant content repository (for example,
http://jackrabbit.apache.org/[Apache Jackrabbit]) with its producer, or
register an EventListener with the consumer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jcr</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------
jcr://user:password@repository/path/to/node
-------------------------------------------

*Consumer added*

From *Camel 2.10* onwards you can use consumer as an EventListener in
JCR or a producer to read a node by identifier.

### Usage

The `repository` element of the URI is used to look up the JCR
`Repository` object in the Camel context registry.

#### JCR Options


// component options: START
The JCR component has no options.
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The JCR endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
jcr:host/base
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (2 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* | *Required* Name of the javax.jcr.Repository to lookup from the Camel registry to be used. |  | String
| *base* | Get the base node when accessing the repository |  | String
|===

==== Query Parameters (14 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *deep* (common) | When isDeep is true events whose associated parent node is at absPath or within its subgraph are received. | false | boolean
| *eventTypes* (common) | eventTypes (a combination of one or more event types encoded as a bit mask value such as javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_ADDED javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_REMOVED etc.). |  | int
| *nodeTypeNames* (common) | When a comma separated nodeTypeName list string is set only events whose associated parent node has one of the node types (or a subtype of one of the node types) in this list will be received. |  | String
| *noLocal* (common) | If noLocal is true then events generated by the session through which the listener was registered are ignored. Otherwise they are not ignored. | false | boolean
| *password* (common) | Password for login |  | String
| *sessionLiveCheckInterval* (common) | Interval in milliseconds to wait before each session live checking The default value is 60000 ms. | 60000 | long
| *sessionLiveCheckIntervalOn Start* (common) | Interval in milliseconds to wait before the first session live checking. The default value is 3000 ms. | 3000 | long
| *username* (common) | Username for login |  | String
| *uuids* (common) | When a comma separated uuid list string is set only events whose associated parent node has one of the identifiers in the comma separated uuid list will be received. |  | String
| *workspaceName* (common) | The workspace to access. If it's not specified then the default one will be used |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END




Please note that the JCR Producer used message properties instead of
message headers in Camel versions earlier than 2.12.3. See
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7067[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7067]
for more details.

### Example

The snippet below creates a node named `node` under the `/home/test`
node in the content repository. One additional property is added to the
node as well: `my.contents.property` which will contain the body of the
message being sent.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:a").setHeader(JcrConstants.JCR_NODE_NAME, constant("node"))
    .setHeader("my.contents.property", body())
    .to("jcr://user:pass@repository/home/test");
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

The following code will register an EventListener under the path
import-application/inbox for Event.NODE_ADDED and Event.NODE_REMOVED
events (event types 1 and 2, both masked as 3) and listening deep for
all the children.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="jcr://user:pass@repository/import-application/inbox?eventTypes=3&deep=true" />
    <to uri="direct:execute-import-application" />
</route>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
