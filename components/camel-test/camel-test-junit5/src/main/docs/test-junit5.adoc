*Since Camel {since}*

The `camel-test-junit5` module is used for unit testing Camel.

The class `org.apache.camel.test.junit5.CamelTestSupport` provides a base JUnit class which you would extend
and implement your Camel unit test.

== Simple unit test example

As shown below is a basic junit test which uses `camel-test-junit5`. The `createRouteBuilder` method is used
for build the routes to be tested. Then the methods with `@Test` annotations are JUnit test methods which
will be executed. The base class `CamelTestSupport` has a number of helper methods to configure testing,
see more at the Javadoc of this class.

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.RoutesBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.component.mock.MockEndpoint;
import org.apache.camel.test.junit5.CamelTestSupport;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class SimpleMockTest extends CamelTestSupport {

    @Test
    public void testMock() throws Exception {
        getMockEndpoint("mock:result").expectedBodiesReceived("Hello World");

        template.sendBody("direct:start", "Hello World");

        MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(context);
    }

    @Override
    protected RoutesBuilder createRouteBuilder() {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() {
                from("direct:start").to("mock:result");
            }
        };
    }

== Migrating Camel Tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5

Find below some hints to help in migrating camel tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.

Projects using `camel-test` would need to use `camel-test-junit5`. For instance, maven users would update their `pom.xml` file as below:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-test-junit5</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

TIP: It's possible to run JUnit4 & JUnit5 based Camel tests side by side including the following dependencies `camel-test`,
`camel-test-junit5` and `junit-vintage-engine`. This configuration allows migrating Camel tests one by one.

=== Migration Steps

* Imports of `org.apache.camel.test.junit4.\*` should be replaced with `org.apache.camel.test.junit5.*`
* `TestSupport` static methods should be imported where needed, for instance `import static org.apache.camel.test.junit5.TestSupport.assertIsInstanceOf`
* Usage of the field `CamelTestSupport.log` should be replaced by another logger, for instance `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyCamelTest.class);`
* Usage of the method `CamelTestSupport.createRegistry` should be replaced by `CamelTestSupport.createCamelRegistry()`
* Overrides of `isCreateCamelContextPerClass()` returning `false` should be removed
* Overrides of `isCreateCamelContextPerClass()` returning `true` should be replaced by `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`
* Usage of the method `CamelTestSupport.assertMockEndpointsSatisfied` should be replaced by `MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(context)`

Once Camel related steps have been performed, there are still typical JUnit 5 migration steps to remember:

* New JUnit 5 assertions should be imported where needed, for instance `import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals`
* Assertion messages should be moved to the last parameter where needed, for instance `assertEquals("message", 2, 1)` becomes `assertEquals(2, 1, "message")`
* `org.junit.Test` should be changed in favor of `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`
* `org.junit.Ignore` should be changed in favor of `org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled`
* `org.junit.Before` should be changed in favor of `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`
* `org.junit.After` should be changed in favor of `org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach`
* `org.junit.BeforeClass` should be changed in favor of `import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll`
* `org.junit.AfterClass` should be changed in favor of `import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll`
* Built-in `assertThat` from third-party assertion libraries should be used. For instance, use `org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat` from `java-hamcrest`

=== Migration From Deprecated Configuration Methods

Camel 4.9 introduced two new interfaces to `CamelTestSupport` that will help users adjust their code and will help us
with future maintenance of the test support code.
These interfaces provide a stable APIs for code needing to configure the test behavior and the context configuration. The new
interfaces are:

* `ConfigurableTest`: that indicates that the test is configurable. This interface defines the methods `configureTest` and `testConfiguration`.
* `ConfigurableContext`: that indicates that the context used in the test is configurable. This interface defines the methods `configureContext` and `camelContextConfiguration`.

During test setup, our code calls these methods at the most appropriate time. As such, user code doesn't necessarily need to worry about when to call them.

Users willing to future-proof their code can leverage the two configuration methods provided by each of these interfaces and adjust their code so that the
configuration is done inside them.

Consider, for instance, a test enabling JMX. Previously, that test would be written like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MyTestClass extends CamelTestSupport {
    // Other code here ...

    @Override
    protected boolean useJmx() {
        return false;
    }

    // More code here ...
}
----

This test can be migrated to the new API like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MyTestClass extends CamelTestSupport {
    // Other code here ...

    @Override
    public void configureTest(TestExecutionConfiguration testExecutionConfiguration) {
        testExecutionConfiguration.withEnableJMX();
    }

    // More code here ...
}
----

The same approach can be used for test code that configures the `CamelContext`. However, in this case, the `configureContext`
method, which receives an instance of `CamelContextConfiguration`, can be used.
