*Since Camel {since}*

The `camel-test-junit6` module is used for unit testing Camel with JUnit 6.

The class `org.apache.camel.test.junit6.CamelTestSupport` provides a base JUnit class which you would extend
and implement your Camel unit test.

== Simple unit test example

As shown below is a basic junit test which uses `camel-test-junit6`. The `createRouteBuilder` method is used
for build the routes to be tested. Then the methods with `@Test` annotations are JUnit test methods which
will be executed. The base class `CamelTestSupport` has a number of helper methods to configure testing,
see more at the Javadoc of this class.

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.RoutesBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.component.mock.MockEndpoint;
import org.apache.camel.test.junit6.CamelTestSupport;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class SimpleMockTest extends CamelTestSupport {

    @Test
    public void testMock() throws Exception {
        getMockEndpoint("mock:result").expectedBodiesReceived("Hello World");

        template.sendBody("direct:start", "Hello World");

        MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(context);
    }

    @Override
    protected RoutesBuilder createRouteBuilder() {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() {
                from("direct:start").to("mock:result");
            }
        };
    }

}

== Migrating Camel Tests from JUnit 5 to JUnit 6

Find below some hints to help in migrating camel tests from JUnit 5 to JUnit 6.

Projects using `camel-test-junit5` would need to use `camel-test-junit6`. For instance, maven users would update their `pom.xml` file as below:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-test-junit6</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Migration Steps

* Imports of `org.apache.camel.test.junit5.\*` should be replaced with `org.apache.camel.test.junit6.*`

Please check the https://docs.junit.org/current/user-guide/[JUnit User Guide] for additional insights about migrating to and writing tests using JUnit 6.
