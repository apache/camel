The Disruptor component provides asynchronous
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture[SEDA] behavior much as the
standard SEDA component, but utilizes a
https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor[Disruptor] instead of a
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html[BlockingQueue]
utilized by the standard xref:seda-component.adoc[SEDA]. Alternatively, a *disruptor-vm:* endpoint is supported by this component. As with the SEDA
component, buffers of the *disruptor:* endpoints are only visible within
a *single* CamelContext and no support is
provided for persistence or recovery. The buffers of the
**disruptor-vm:** endpoints also provides support for communication
across CamelContexts instances so you can use this mechanism to
communicate across web applications (provided that *camel-disruptor.jar*
is on the *system/boot* classpath).

The main advantage of choosing to use the Disruptor component over the
SEDA is performance in use cases where there is high
contention between producer(s) and/or multicasted or concurrent
consumers. In those cases, significant increases of throughput and
reduction of latency has been observed. Performance in scenarios without
contention is comparable to the SEDA component.

The Disruptor is implemented with the intention of mimicing the
behaviour and options of the SEDA component as much as possible.
The main differences with the them are the following:

* The buffer used is always bounded in size (default 1024 exchanges).
* As a the buffer is always bouded, the default behaviour for the
Disruptor is to block while the buffer is full instead of throwing an
exception. This default behaviour may be configured on the component
(see options).
* The Disruptor enpoints don't implement the BrowsableEndpoint
interface. As such, the exchanges currently in the Disruptor can't be
retrieved, only the amount of exchanges.
* The Disruptor requires its consumers (multicasted or otherwise) to be
statically configured. Adding or removing consumers on the fly requires
complete flushing of all pending exchanges in the Disruptor.
* As a result of the reconfiguration: Data sent over a Disruptor is
directly processed and 'gone' if there is at least one consumer, late
joiners only get new exchanges published after they've joined.
* The *pollTimeout* option is not supported by the Disruptor component.
* When a producer blocks on a full Disruptor, it does not respond to
thread interrupts.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-disruptor</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

--------------------------------
 disruptor-vm:someName[?options]
--------------------------------

Where **someName** can be any string that uniquely identifies the
endpoint within the current CamelContext.
