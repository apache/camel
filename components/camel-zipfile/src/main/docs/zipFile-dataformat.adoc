*Since Camel {since}*

The Zip File Data Format is a message compression and decompression format.
Messages can be marshaled (compressed) to Zip files containing a single entry, and Zip files containing a single
entry can be unmarshalled (decompressed) to the original file contents.
This data format supports ZIP64, as long as Java 7 or later is being used.

== Marshal

In this example, we marshal a regular text/XML payload to a compressed
payload using Zip file compression, and send it to an ActiveMQ queue
called MY_QUEUE.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .marshal().zipFile()
    .to("activemq:queue:MY_QUEUE");
----

The name of the Zip entry inside the created Zip file is based on the
incoming `CamelFileName` message header, which is the standard message
header used by the file component. Additionally, the
outgoing `CamelFileName` message header is automatically set to the
value of the incoming `CamelFileName` message header, with the ".zip"
suffix. So, for example, if the following route finds a file named
"test.txt" in the input directory, the output will be a Zip file named
"test.txt.zip" containing a single Zip entry named "test.txt":

[source,java]
----
from("file:input/directory?antInclude=*/.txt")
    .marshal().zipFile()
    .to("file:output/directory");
----

If there is no incoming `CamelFileName` message header, (for example, if
the file component is not the consumer), then the
message ID is used by default.
Since the message ID is normally a unique generated ID, you will end up with filenames like
`ID-MACHINENAME-2443-1211718892437-1-0.zip`. If you want to override
this behavior, then you can set the value of the `CamelFileName` header
explicitly in your route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .setHeader(Exchange.FILE_NAME, constant("report.txt"))
    .marshal().zipFile()
    .to("file:output/directory");
----

This route would result in a Zip file named "report.txt.zip" in the
output directory, containing a single Zip entry named "report.txt".

== Unmarshal

In this example we unmarshal a Zip file payload from an ActiveMQ queue
called MY_QUEUE to its original format, and forward it for processing to
the `UnZippedMessageProcessor`.

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:queue:MY_QUEUE")
    .unmarshal().zipFile()
    .process(new UnZippedMessageProcessor());
----

If the zip file has more than one entry, the usingIterator option of
ZipFileDataFormat to be true, and you can use splitter to do the further
work.

[source,java]
----
ZipFileDataFormat zipFile = new ZipFileDataFormat();
zipFile.setUsingIterator(true);

from("file:src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/dataformat/zipfile/?delay=1000&noop=true")
    .unmarshal(zipFile)
    .split(bodyAs(Iterator.class)).streaming()
        .process(new UnZippedMessageProcessor())
    .end();
----

Or you can use the ZipSplitter as an expression for splitter directly like this:

[source,java]
----
from("file:src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/dataformat/zipfile?delay=1000&noop=true")
    .split(new ZipSplitter()).streaming()
        .process(new UnZippedMessageProcessor())
    .end();
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You *cannot* use ZipSplitter in _parallel_ mode with the splitter.
====

== Aggregate

[NOTE]
====
Please note that this aggregation strategy requires eager completion check to work properly.
====

In this example, we aggregate all text files found in the input directory
into a single Zip file that is stored in the output directory. 

[source,java]
----
from("file:input/directory?antInclude=*/.txt")
    .aggregate(constant(true), new ZipAggregationStrategy())
        .completionFromBatchConsumer().eagerCheckCompletion()
        .to("file:output/directory");
----

The outgoing `CamelFileName` message header is created using
java.io.File.createTempFile, with the ".zip" suffix. If you want to
override this behavior, then you can set the value of
the `CamelFileName` header explicitly in your route:

[source,java]
----
from("file:input/directory?antInclude=*/.txt")
    .aggregate(constant(true), new ZipAggregationStrategy())
        .completionFromBatchConsumer().eagerCheckCompletion()
        .setHeader(Exchange.FILE_NAME, constant("reports.zip"))
        .to("file:output/directory");
----

== Dependencies

To use Zip files in your camel routes, you need to add a dependency on
*camel-zipfile* which implements this data format.

If you use Maven you can add the following to your `pom.xml`,
substituting the version number for the latest & greatest release (see
the download page for the latest versions).

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-zipfile</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
