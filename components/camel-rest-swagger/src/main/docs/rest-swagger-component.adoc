*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The REST Swagger* configures rest producers from
http://swagger.io/[Swagger] (Open API) specification document and
delegates to a component implementing the _RestProducerFactory_
interface. Currently known working components are:

* xref:http-component.adoc[http]
* xref:netty-http-component.adoc[netty-http]
* xref:undertow-component.adoc[undertow]

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their
`pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-rest-swagger</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

-------------------------------------------------------
rest-swagger:[specificationPath#]operationId
-------------------------------------------------------

Where `operationId` is the ID of the operation in the Swagger
specification, and `specificationPath` is the path to the
specification.
If the `specificationPath` is not specified it defaults to
`swagger.json`. The lookup mechanism uses Camels `ResourceHelper` to
load the resource, which means that you can use CLASSPATH resources 
(`classpath:my-specification.json`), files 
(`file:/some/path.json`), the web 
(`\http://api.example.com/swagger.json`) or reference a bean 
(`ref:nameOfBean`) or use a method of a bean 
(`bean:nameOfBean.methodName`) to get the specification resource,
failing that Swagger's own resource loading support.

This component does not act as a HTTP client, it delegates that to
another component mentioned above. The lookup mechanism searches for a
single component that implements the _RestProducerFactory_ interface and
uses that. If the CLASSPATH contains more than one, then the property
`componentName` should be set to indicate which component to delegate
to.

Most of the configuration is taken from the Swagger specification but
the option exists to override those by specifying them on the component
or on the endpoint. Typically you would just need to override the 
`host` or `basePath` if those differ from the specification.

[NOTE]
====
The `host` parameter should contain the absolute URI containing
scheme, hostname and port number, for instance:
`\https://api.example.com`
====

With `componentName` you specify what component is used to perform the
requests, this named component needs to be present in the Camel context
and implement the required _RestProducerFactory_ interface -- as do the
components listed at the top.

If you do not specify the _componentName_ at either component or 
endpoint level, CLASSPATH is searched for a suitable delegate. There 
should be only one component present on the CLASSPATH that implements 
the _RestProducerFactory_ interface for this to work.

This component's endpoint URI is lenient which means that in addition
to message headers you can specify REST operation's parameters as
endpoint parameters, these will be constant for all subsequent
invocations so it makes sense to use this feature only for parameters
that are indeed constant for all invocations -- for example API version
in path such as `/api/\{version}/users/\{id}`.

== Example: PetStore

Checkout the example in the `camel-example-rest-swagger` project in
the `examples` directory.

For example if you wanted to use the 
http://petstore.swagger.io/[_PetStore_] provided REST API simply
reference the specification URI and desired operation id from the
Swagger specification or download the specification and store it as
`swagger.json` (in the root) of CLASSPATH that way it will be 
automaticaly used. Let's use the xref:undertow-component.adoc[Undertow]
component to perform all the requests and Camels excelent support for 
Spring Boot.

Here are our dependencies defined in Maven POM file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-undertow-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-rest-swagger-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Start by defining the _Undertow_ component and the
_RestSwaggerComponent_:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Component petstore(CamelContext camelContext, UndertowComponent undertow) {
    RestSwaggerComponent petstore = new RestSwaggerComponent(camelContext);
    petstore.setSpecificationUri("http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json");
    petstore.setDelegate(undertow);

    return petstore;
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Support in Camel for Spring Boot will auto create the 
`UndertowComponent` Spring bean, and you can configure it using
`application.properties` (or `application.yml`) using prefix
`camel.component.undertow.`. We are defining the `petstore`
component here in order to have a named component in the Camel context
that we can use to interact with the PetStore REST API, if this is the
only `rest-swagger` component used we might configure it in the same
manner (using `application.properties`).
====

Now in our application we can simply use the `ProducerTemplate` to
invoke PetStore REST methods:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
ProducerTemplate template;

String getPetJsonById(int petId) {
    return template.requestBodyAndHeaders("petstore:getPetById", null, "petId", petId);
}
