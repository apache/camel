== REST Swagger Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.19*

The *rest-swagger* configures rest producers from 
http://swagger.io/[Swagger] (Open API) specification document and
delegates to a component implementing the _RestProducerFactory_
interface. Currently known working components are:

* <<http-component,http>>
* <<http4-component,http4>>
* <<netty4-http-component,netty4-http>>
* <<restlet-component,restlet>>
* <<jetty-component,jetty>>
* <<undertow-component,undertow>>

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their
`pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-rest-swagger</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
rest-swagger:[specificationPath#]operationId
-------------------------------------------------------

Where `operationId` is the ID of the operation in the Swagger
specification, and `specificationPath` is the path to the
specification.
If the `specificationPath` is not specified it defaults to
`swagger.json`. The lookup mechanism uses Camels `ResourceHelper` to
load the resource, which means that you can use CLASSPATH resources 
(`classpath:my-specification.json`), files 
(`file:/some/path.json`), the web 
(`http://api.example.com/swagger.json`) or reference a bean 
(`ref:nameOfBean`) or use a method of a bean 
(`bean:nameOfBean.methodName`) to get the specification resource,
failing that Swagger's own resource loading support.

This component does not act as a HTTP client, it delegates that to
another component mentioned above. The lookup mechanism searches for a
single component that implements the _RestProducerFactory_ interface and
uses that. If the CLASSPATH contains more than one, then the property
`componentName` should be set to indicate which component to delegate
to.

Most of the configuration is taken from the Swagger specification but
the option exists to override those by specifying them on the component
or on the endpoint. Typically you would just need to override the 
`host` or `basePath` if those differ from the specification.

NOTE: The `host` parameter should contain the absolute URI containing
scheme, hostname and port number, for instance:
`https://api.example.com`

With `componentName` you specify what component is used to perform the
requests, this named component needs to be present in the Camel context
and implement the required _RestProducerFactory_ interface -- as do the
components listed at the top.

If you do not specify the _componentName_ at either component or 
endpoint level, CLASSPATH is searched for a suitable delegate. There 
should be only one component present on the CLASSPATH that implements 
the _RestProducerFactory_ interface for this to work.

This component's endpoint URI is lenient which means that in addition
to message headers you can specify REST operation's parameters as
endpoint parameters, these will be constant for all subsequent
invocations so it makes sense to use this feature only for parameters
that are indeed constant for all invocations -- for example API version
in path such as `/api/{version}/users/{id}`. 

### Options

// component options: START
The REST Swagger component supports 9 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basePath* (producer) | API basePath, for example /v2. Default is unset, if set overrides the value present in Swagger specification. |  | String
| *componentName* (producer) | Name of the Camel component that will perform the requests. The compnent must be present in Camel registry and it must implement RestProducerFactory service provider interface. If not set CLASSPATH is searched for single component that implements RestProducerFactory SPI. Can be overriden in endpoint configuration. |  | String
| *consumes* (producer) | What payload type this component capable of consuming. Could be one type, like application/json or multiple types as application/json, application/xml; q=0.5 according to the RFC7231. This equates to the value of Accept HTTP header. If set overrides any value found in the Swagger specification. Can be overriden in endpoint configuration |  | String
| *host* (producer) | Scheme hostname and port to direct the HTTP requests to in the form of https://hostname:port. Can be configured at the endpoint, component or in the correspoding REST configuration in the Camel Context. If you give this component a name (e.g. petstore) that REST configuration is consulted first, rest-swagger next, and global configuration last. If set overrides any value found in the Swagger specification, RestConfiguration. Can be overriden in endpoint configuration. |  | String
| *produces* (producer) | What payload type this component is producing. For example application/json according to the RFC7231. This equates to the value of Content-Type HTTP header. If set overrides any value present in the Swagger specification. Can be overriden in endpoint configuration. |  | String
| *specificationUri* (producer) | Path to the Swagger specification file. The scheme, host base path are taken from this specification, but these can be overriden with properties on the component or endpoint level. If not given the component tries to load swagger.json resource. Note that the host defined on the component and endpoint of this Component should contain the scheme, hostname and optionally the port in the URI syntax (i.e. https://api.example.com:8080). Can be overriden in endpoint configuration. | swagger.json | URI
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | Customize TLS parameters used by the component. If not set defaults to the TLS parameters set in the Camel context |  | SSLContextParameters
| *useGlobalSslContext Parameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean
| *resolveProperty Placeholders* (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean

### Example: PetStore

Checkout the example in the `camel-example-rest-swagger` project in
the `examples` directory.

For example if you wanted to use the 
http://petstore.swagger.io/[_PetStore_] provided REST API simply
reference the specification URI and desired operation id from the
Swagger specification or download the specification and store it as
`swagger.json` (in the root) of CLASSPATH that way it will be 
automaticaly used. Let's use the <<undertow-component,Undertow>>
component to perform all the requests and Camels excelent support for 
Spring Boot.

Here are our dependencies defined in Maven POM file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-undertow-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-rest-swagger-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Start by defining the _Undertow_ component and the
_RestSwaggerComponent_:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Component petstore(CamelContext camelContext, UndertowComponent undertow) {
    RestSwaggerComponent petstore = new RestSwaggerComponent(camelContext);
    petstore.setSpecificationUri("http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json");
    petstore.setDelegate(undertow);

    return petstore;
}
----

NOTE: Support in Camel for Spring Boot will auto create the 
`UndertowComponent` Spring bean, and you can configure it using
`application.properties` (or `application.yml`) using prefix
`camel.component.undertow.`. We are defining the `petstore`
component here in order to have a named component in the Camel context
that we can use to interact with the PetStore REST API, if this is the
only `rest-swagger` component used we might configure it in the same
manner (using `application.properties`).

Now in our application we can simply use the `ProducerTemplate` to
invoke PetStore REST methods:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
ProducerTemplate template;

String getPetJsonById(int petId) {
    return template.requestBodyAndHeaders("petstore:getPetById", null, "petId", petId);
}
----
