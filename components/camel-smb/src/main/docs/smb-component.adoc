== Usage

For instance, polling all the files from a SMB file share and reading their contents would look like this:

[source,java]
----
private void process(Exchange exchange) throws IOException {
    final File file = exchange.getMessage().getBody(File.class);
    try (InputStream inputStream = file.getInputStream()) {
        LOG.debug("Read exchange: {}, with contents: {}", file.getFileInformation(), new String(inputStream.readAllBytes()));
    }
}

public void configure() {
    fromF("smb:%s/%s?username=%s&password=%s&path=/", service.address(), service.shareName(), service.userName(), service.password())
        .process(this::process)
        .to("mock:result");
}
