/**
 * To run this test manually through Maven first remove the {@link Ignore}
 * annotation below, then make sure you've got a network interface with the name
 * <code>en0</code> as given by the route below. If this is not the case run
 * your OS specific command to find out which network interfaces you've got
 * supporting IPv4 (e.g. on OS-X that would be the {@code ifconfig -a} command.
 * Next you need to enable UDP multicast on your OS for the given multicast
 * address of this test ({@code 224.1.2.3}). For this purpose e.g. on OS-X
 * follow the steps being described <a href=
 * "http://blogs.agilefaqs.com/2009/11/08/enabling-multicast-on-your-macos-unix/"
 * >here</a>. Now running the test manually should succeed (<b>but only</b> when
 * using Java7+):
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   mvn test -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Dtest=NettyUDPMulticastAsyncTest
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Please note that using the JUnit {@link BeforeClass} annotation together with
 * the corresponding {@link System#setProperty(String, String) Java API} to set
 * the {@code java.net.preferIPv4Stack} system property would not work here as
 * at that moment it would be too <b>late</b> to set this system property. On
 * the other hand setting such a system property through the surefire-plugin
 * would cause side effect by the other tests of this component.
