| Name | Description | Default | Type

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *type* (consumer) | Endpoint type to use. Only streaming supports event type. | polling | EndpointType
| *distanceMetric* (consumer) | Used by the non-stream geography search to search by radius using the configured metrics. The unit can either be mi for miles or km for kilometers. You need to configure all the following options: longitude latitude radius and distanceMetric. | km | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *latitude* (consumer) | Used by the non-stream geography search to search by latitude. You need to configure all the following options: longitude latitude radius and distanceMetric. |  | Double
| *locations* (consumer) | Bounding boxes created by pairs of lat/lons. Can be used for streaming/filter. A pair is defined as latlon. And multiple paris can be separated by semi colon. |  | String
| *longitude* (consumer) | Used by the non-stream geography search to search by longitude. You need to configure all the following options: longitude latitude radius and distanceMetric. |  | Double
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPoll Strategy
| *radius* (consumer) | Used by the non-stream geography search to search by radius. You need to configure all the following options: longitude latitude radius and distanceMetric. |  | Double
| *twitterStream* (consumer) | To use a custom instance of TwitterStream |  | TwitterStream
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

| *lang* (filter) | The lang string ISO_639-1 which will be used for searching |  | String
| *numberOfPages* (filter) | The number of pages result which you want camel-twitter to consume. | 1 | Integer
| *sinceId* (filter) | The last tweet id which will be used for pulling the tweets. It is useful when the camel route is restarted after a long running. | 1 | long
| *userIds* (filter) | To filter by user ids for streaming/filter. Multiple values can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 30000 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
