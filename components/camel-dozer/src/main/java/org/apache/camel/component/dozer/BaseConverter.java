/**
 * Configurable converters in Dozer are not thread-safe if a single converter 
 * instance is used.  One thread could step on the parameter being used by 
 * another thread since setParameter() is called first and convert() is called 
 * separately.  This implementation holds a copy of the parameter in 
 * thread-local storage which eliminates the possibility of collision between
 * threads on a single converter instance.
 * 
 * Any converter which is referenced by ID with the Dozer component should
 * extend this class.  It is recommended to call done() in a finally block 
 * in the implementation of convert() to clean up the value stored in the 
 * thread local.
