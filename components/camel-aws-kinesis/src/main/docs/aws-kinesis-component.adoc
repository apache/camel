*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Kinesis component supports receiving messages from and sending messages to Amazon Kinesis
service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Kinesis. More information are available
at https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/[AWS Kinesis]

== URI Format

[source,java]
-----------------------------------
aws-kinesis://stream-name[?options]
-----------------------------------

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Kinesis component supports 17 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonKinesisClient* (common) | Amazon Kinesis client to use for all requests for this endpoint |  | AmazonKinesis
| *autoDiscoverClient* (common) | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking | true | boolean
| *configuration* (common) | The component configuration |  | KinesisConfiguration
| *proxyHost* (common) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Kinesis client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (common) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Kinesis client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (common) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Kinesis client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (common) | The region in which Kinesis client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1)You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *iteratorType* (consumer) | Defines where in the Kinesis stream to start getting records. There are 5 enums and the value can be one of: AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER, AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER, TRIM_HORIZON, LATEST, AT_TIMESTAMP | TRIM_HORIZON | ShardIteratorType
| *maxResultsPerRequest* (consumer) | Maximum number of records that will be fetched in each poll | 1 | int
| *sequenceNumber* (consumer) | The sequence number to start polling from. Required if iteratorType is set to AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER or AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER |  | String
| *shardClosed* (consumer) | Define what will be the behavior in case of shard closed. Possible value are ignore, silent and fail. In case of ignore a message will be logged and the consumer will restart from the beginning,in case of silent there will be no logging and the consumer will start from the beginning,in case of fail a ReachedClosedStateException will be raised. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: ignore, fail, silent | ignore | KinesisShardClosedStrategyEnum
| *shardId* (consumer) | Defines which shardId in the Kinesis stream to get records from |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

// endpoint options: END







Required Kinesis component options

You have to provide the amazonKinesisClient in the
Registry with proxies and relevant credentials
configured.

== Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

== Usage

=== Message headers set by the Kinesis consumer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKinesisSequenceNumber` |`String` |The sequence number of the record. This is represented as a String as it
size is not defined by the API. If it is to be used as a numerical type then use

|`CamelAwsKinesisApproximateArrivalTimestamp` |`String` |The time AWS assigned as the arrival time of the record.

|`CamelAwsKinesisPartitionKey` |`String` |Identifies which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to.
|=======================================================================

=== AmazonKinesis configuration

You will need to create an instance of AmazonKinesisClient and
bind it to the registry

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

Region region = Region.getRegion(Regions.fromName(region));
region.createClient(AmazonKinesisClient.class, null, clientConfiguration);
// the 'null' here is the AWSCredentialsProvider which defaults to an instance of DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain

registry.bind("kinesisClient", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You then have to reference the AmazonKinesisClient in the `amazonKinesisClient` URI option.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-kinesis://mykinesisstream?amazonKinesisClient=#kinesisClient")
  .to("log:out?showAll=true");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Providing AWS Credentials

It is recommended that the credentials are obtained by using the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html[DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain]
that is the default when creating a new ClientConfiguration instance,
however, a
different http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/AWSCredentialsProvider.html[AWSCredentialsProvider]
can be specified when calling createClient(...).

=== Message headers used by the Kinesis producer to write to Kinesis.  The producer expects that the message body is a `byte[]`.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKinesisPartitionKey` |`String` |The PartitionKey to pass to Kinesis to store this record.

|`CamelAwsKinesisSequenceNumber` |`String` |Optional paramter to indicate the sequence number of this record.

|=======================================================================

=== Message headers set by the Kinesis producer on successful storage of a Record

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKinesisSequenceNumber` |`String` |The sequence number of the record, as defined in
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html#API_PutRecord_ResponseSyntax[Response Syntax]

|`CamelAwsKinesisShardId` |`String` |The shard ID of where the Record was stored


|=======================================================================

== Automatic detection of AmazonKinesis client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonKinesis bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-kinesis</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
