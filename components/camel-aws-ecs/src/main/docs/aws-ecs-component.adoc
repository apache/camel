[[aws-ecs-component]]
= AWS ECS Component

*Since Camel 3.0*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The ECS component supports create, delete, describe and list
https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[AWS ECS] clusters instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon ECS. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS].

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws-ecs://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS ECS component supports 11 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *configuration* (producer) | The component configuration |  | ECSConfiguration
| *ecsClient* (producer) | To use a existing configured AWS ECS as client |  | AmazonECS
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. The value can be one of: listClusters, describeCluster, createCluster, deleteCluster |  | ECSOperations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the ECS client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the ECS client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the ECS client. The value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which ECS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *secretKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The AWS ECS endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-ecs:label
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *label* | *Required* Logical name |  | String

=== Query Parameters (11 parameters):

| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

Required ECS component options

You have to provide the amazonECSClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS] service.

== Usage

=== Message headers evaluated by the ECS producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsECSMaxResults` |`Integer` |The limit number of results while listing clusters

|`CamelAwsECSOperation` |`String` |The operation we want to perform

|`CamelAwsECSClusterName` |`String` |The cluster name
|=======================================================================

=== ECS Producer operations

Camel-AWS ECS component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listClusters
- createCluster
- describeCluster
- deleteCluster

== Producer Examples

- listClusters: this operation will list the available clusters in ECS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listClusters")
    .to("aws-ecs://test?ecsClient=#amazonEcsClient&operation=listClusters")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Automatic detection of AmazonECS client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonECS bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-ecs</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version\}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
