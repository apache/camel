# Running the tests

Running the tests for this component may require adjustments to the maximum number of open files. Some modern systems 
may set the limit of open files to 4096, which is not sufficient to run these tests. Ideally, a limit of at least 8192 
is recommended. Consult your OS documentation for details about how to correctly adjust this parameter.
