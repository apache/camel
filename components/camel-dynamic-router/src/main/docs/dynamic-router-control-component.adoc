*Since Camel {since}*

The Dynamic Router Control endpoint is a special type of endpoint in the Dynamic Router component where routing
participants can subscribe or unsubscribe dynamically at runtime. By sending control messages to this endpoint,
participants can specify their own routing rules and alter the dynamic rule base of the Dynamic Router component in
real-time. Participants can choose between using URI query parameters, and sending a control message as the exchange
message body.

== URI format

// endpoint options: END

== Subscribing

Subscribing can be achieved by using query parameters in the control endpoint URI, or by sending a
`DynamicRouterControlMessage` to the control endpoint URI.

=== URI examples

.Example Java URI `RouteBuilder` Subscription
[source,java]
----
// Send a subscribe request to the dynamic router that will match every exchange and route messages to the URI: "direct:myDestination"
from("direct:subscribe").to("dynamic-router-control:subscribe?subscribeChannel=myChannel&subscriptionId=mySubId&destinationUri=direct:myDestination&priority=5&predicate=true&expressionLanguage=simple");
----

.Example Java URI `ProducerTemplate` Subscription
[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
context.start();
ProducerTemplate template = context.createProducerTemplate();
RouteBuilder.addRoutes(context, rb -> {
    // Route for subscriber destination
    rb.from("direct:myDestination")
            .to("log:dynamicRouterExample?showAll=true&multiline=true");
    // Route for subscribing
    rb.from("direct://subscribe")
            .toD("dynamic-router-control://subscribe" +
                    "?subscribeChannel=${header.subscribeChannel}" +
                    "&subscriptionId=${header.subscriptionId}" +
                    "&destinationUri=${header.destinationUri}" +
                    "&priority=${header.priority}" +
                    "&predicateBean=${header.predicateBean}");
});
Predicate predicate = PredicateBuilder.constant(true);
context.getRegistry().bind("predicate", predicate);
template.sendBodyAndHeaders("direct:subscribe", "",
        Map.of("subscribeChannel", "test",
                "subscriptionId", "testSubscription1",
                "destinationUri", "direct:myDestination",
                "priority", "1",
                "predicateBean", "predicate"));
----
Above, because the control URI is dynamic, and since a `ProducerTemplate` does not have a built-in way to send to a
dynamic URI, we have to send subscription parameters from a `ProducerTemplate` in a different way.  The dynamic-aware
endpoint uses headers "under the hood", because the URI params are converted to headers, so we can set the headers
deliberately.

=== DynamicRouterControlMessage example

.Example Java `DynamicRouterControlMessage` Subscription
[source,java]
----
DynamicRouterControlMessage controlMessage = DynamicRouterControlMessage.newBuilder()
    .subscribeChannel("myChannel")
    .subscriptionId("mySubId")
    .destinationUri("direct:myDestination")
    .priority(5)
    .predicate("true")
    .expressionLanguage("simple")
    .build();
producerTemplate.sendBody("dynamic-router-control:subscribe", controlMessage);
----

== Unsubscribing

Like subscribing, unsubscribing can also  be achieved by using query parameters in the control endpoint URI, or by
sending a `DynamicRouterControlMessage` to the control endpoint URI.  The difference is that unsubscribing can be
achieved by using either one or two parameters.

=== URI examples

.Example Java URI `RouteBuilder` Unsubscribe
[source,java]
----
from("direct:subscribe").to("dynamic-router-control:unsubscribe?subscribeChannel=myChannel&subscriptionId=mySubId");
----

.Example Java URI `ProducerTemplate` Unsubscribe
[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
context.start();
ProducerTemplate template = context.createProducerTemplate();
RouteBuilder.addRoutes(context, rb -> {
    // Route for unsubscribing
    rb.from("direct://unsubscribe")
            .toD("dynamic-router-control://unsubscribe" +
                    "?subscribeChannel=${header.subscribeChannel}" +
                    "&subscriptionId=${header.subscriptionId}");
});
template.sendBodyAndHeaders("direct:unsubscribe", "",
        Map.of("subscribeChannel", "test",
                "subscriptionId", "testSubscription1"));
----
Above, because the control URI is dynamic, we have to send it from a `ProducerTemplate` in a different way.  The
dynamic-aware endpoint uses headers, rather than URI params, so we set the headers deliberately.

=== DynamicRouterControlMessage example

.Example Java `DynamicRouterControlMessage` Unsubscribe
[source,java]
----
DynamicRouterControlMessage controlMessage = DynamicRouterControlMessage.newBuilder()
    .subscribeChannel("myChannel")
    .subscriptionId("mySubId")
    .build();
producerTemplate.sendBody("dynamic-router-control:unsubscribe", controlMessage);
----

== The Dynamic Rule Base

To determine if an exchange is suitable for any of the participants, all predicates for the participants that are
subscribed to the channel are evaluated until the first result of "true" is found, by default.  If the Dynamic Router
is configured with the `recipientMode` set to `allMatch`, then all recipients with matching predicates will be
selected.  The exchange will be routed to the corresponding endpoint(s).  The rule base contains a default filter
registered at the least priority (which is the highest integer number).  Like the "default" case of a switch
statement in Java, any message that is not appropriate for any registered participants will be processed by this
filter.  The filter logs information about the dropped message at *debug* level, by default.  To turn the level up to
*warn*, include `warnDroppedMessage=true` in the component URI.

Rules are registered in a channel, and they are logically separate from rules in another channel.  Subscription IDs
must be unique within a channel, although multiple subscriptions of the same name may coexist in a dynamic router
instance if they are in separate channels.

The Dynamic Router employs the use of xref:manual::predicate.adoc[Predicate] as rules.  Any valid predicate may be
used to determine the suitability of exchanges for a participating recipient, whether they are simple or compound
predicates.  Although it is advised to view the complete documentation, an example simple predicate might look like the
following:

.Example simple predicate
[source,java]
----
// The "messageType" must be "payment"
Predicate msgType = header("messageType").isEqualTo("payment");
----

== JMX Control and Monitoring Operations

The Dynamic Router Control component supports some JMX operations that allow you to control and monitor the component.
It is beyond the scope of this document to go into detail about JMX, so this is a list of the operations that are
supported.  For more information about JMX, see the xref:manual::jmx.adoc[JMX] documentation.

.Subscribing with a predicate expression
[source,java]
----
String subscribeWithPredicateExpression(String, String, String, int, String, String, boolean)
----
This operation provides the ability to subscribe to a channel with a predicate expression. The parameters, in order, are
as follows:

 - subscription ID
 - channel name
 - destination URI
 - priority
 - predicate expression
 - expression language
 - update the subscription (true), or add a new one (false)

.Subscribing with a predicate bean
[source,java]
----
String subscribeWithPredicateBean(String, String, String, int, String, boolean)
----
This operation provides the ability to subscribe to a channel with the name of a Predicate that has been bound in the
registry. The parameters, in order, are as follows:

 - subscription ID
 - channel name
 - destination URI
 - priority
 - predicate bean name
 - update the subscription (true), or add a new one (false)

.Subscribing with a predicate instance
[source,java]
----
String subscribeWithPredicateInstance(String, String, String, int, Object, boolean)
----
This operation provides the ability to subscribe to a channel with an instance of a Predicate. The parameters, in order,
are as follows:

 - subscription ID
 - channel name
 - destination URI
 - priority
 - predicate instance
 - update the subscription (true), or add a new one (false)

.Unsubscribing
[source,java]
----
boolean removeSubscription(String, String)
----
This operation provides the ability to unsubscribe from a channel. The parameters, in order, are as follows:

 - subscription ID
 - channel name

.Getting the subscriptions map
[source,java]
----
Map<String, ConcurrentSkipListSet<PrioritizedFilter>> getSubscriptionsMap()
----
This operation provides the ability to get the subscriptions map.  The map is keyed by channel name, and the values are
a set of prioritized filters.

.Getting the subscriptions statistics map
[source,java]
----
Map<String, List<PrioritizedFilterStatistics>> getSubscriptionsStatisticsMap()
----
This operation provides the ability to get the subscriptions statistics map.  The map is keyed by channel name, and the
values are a list of prioritized filter statistics, including the number of messages that have matched the filter, and
had the exchange sent to the destination URI.
