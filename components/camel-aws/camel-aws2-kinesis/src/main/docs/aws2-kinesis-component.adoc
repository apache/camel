*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 Kinesis component supports consuming messages from and producing messages to Amazon Kinesis (no Batch supported)
service.

The AWS2 Kinesis component also supports Synchronous and Asynchronous Client, which means you choose what fits best your requirements,
so if you need the connection (client) to be async, there's a property of 'asyncClient' (in DSL also can be found) needs to be turned true.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Kinesis. More information is available
at https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/[AWS Kinesis]


== URI Format

-----------------------------------
aws2-kinesis://stream-name[?options]
-----------------------------------

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format:

`?options=value&option2=value&...`


// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END


Required Kinesis component options

You have to provide the KinesisClient in the
Registry with proxies and relevant credentials
configured.

== Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you, for instance, to know how many messages exist in this
batch and for instance, let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

The consumer is able to consume either from a single specific shard or
all available shards (multiple shards consumption) of Amazon Kinesis, therefore, if you leave the 'shardId'
property in the DSL configuration empty, then it'll consume all available shards
otherwise only the specified shard corresponding to the shardId will be consumed.

== Usage

=== Static credentials, Default Credential Provider and Profile Credentials Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static credentials by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and set it to true.

The order of evaluation for Default Credentials Provider is the following:

- Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`.
- Environment variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
- Web Identity Token from AWS STS.
- The shared credentials and config files.
- Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the environment variable `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is set.
- Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials.

You have also the possibility of using Profile Credentials Provider, by specifying the useProfileCredentialsProvider option to true and profileCredentialsName to the profile name.

Only one of static, default and profile credentials could be used at the same time.

For more information about this you can look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS credentials documentation]

// component headers: START
include::partial$component-endpoint-headers.adoc[]
// component headers: END

=== AmazonKinesis configuration

You then have to reference the KinesisClient in the `amazonKinesisClient` URI option.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-kinesis://mykinesisstream?amazonKinesisClient=#kinesisClient")
  .to("log:out?showAll=true");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Providing AWS Credentials

It is recommended that the credentials are obtained by using the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html[DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain]
that is the default when creating a new ClientConfiguration instance,
however, a
different http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/AWSCredentialsProvider.html[AWSCredentialsProvider]
can be specified when calling createClient(...).

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-kinesis</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
