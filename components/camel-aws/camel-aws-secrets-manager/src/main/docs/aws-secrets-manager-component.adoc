*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS Secrets Manager component supports list secret
https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Secrets Manager. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager].


== URI Format

-------------------------
aws-secrets-manager://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...


// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END

=== Using AWS Secrets Manager Property Function

To use this function you'll need to provide credentials to AWS Secrets Manager Service as environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=accessKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_SECRET_KEY=secretKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_REGION=region
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.accessKey = accessKey
camel.vault.aws.secretKey = secretKey
camel.vault.aws.region = region
----

If you want instead to use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS default credentials provider], you'll need to provide the following env variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_USE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=true
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_REGION=region
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.defaultCredentialsProvider = true
camel.vault.aws.region = region
----

At this point you'll be able to reference a property in the following way:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Where route will be the name of the secret stored in the AWS Secrets Manager Service.

You could specify a default value in case the secret is not present on AWS Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route:default}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist, the property will fallback to "default" as value.

Also you are able to get particular field of the secret, if you have for example a secret named database of this form:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123",
  "engine": "postgres",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3128",
  "dbname": "db"
}
----

You're able to do get single secret value in your route, like for example:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{aws:database/username}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Or re-use the property as part of an endpoint.

You could specify a default value in case the particular field of secret is not present on AWS Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{aws:database/username:admin}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist or the secret exists, but the username field is not part of the secret, the property will fallback to "admin" as value.

There is also the syntax to get a particular version of the secret for both the approach, with field/default value specified or only with secret:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route@bf9b4f4b-8e63-43fd-a73c-3e2d3748b451}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the RAW route secret with version 'bf9b4f4b-8e63-43fd-a73c-3e2d3748b451'.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route:default@bf9b4f4b-8e63-43fd-a73c-3e2d3748b451}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the route secret value with version 'bf9b4f4b-8e63-43fd-a73c-3e2d3748b451' or default value in case the secret doesn't exist or the version doesn't exist.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{aws:database/username:admin@bf9b4f4b-8e63-43fd-a73c-3e2d3748b451}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the username field of the database secret with version 'bf9b4f4b-8e63-43fd-a73c-3e2d3748b451' or admin in case the secret doesn't exist or the version doesn't exist.

For the moment we are not considering the rotation function, if any will be applied, but it is in the work to be done.

The only requirement is adding the camel-aws-secrets-manager jar to your Camel application.

=== Automatic Camel context reloading on Secret Refresh

Being able to reload Camel context on a Secret Refresh, could be done by specifying the usual credentials (the same used for AWS Secret Manager Property Function).

With Environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_USE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=accessKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_REGION=region
----

or as plain Camel main properties:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.useDefaultCredentialProvider = true
camel.vault.aws.region = region
----

Or by specifying accessKey/SecretKey and region, instead of using the default credentials provider chain.

To enable the automatic refresh you'll need additional properties to set:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.refreshEnabled=true
camel.vault.aws.refreshPeriod=60000
camel.vault.aws.secrets=Secret
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
----

where `camel.vault.aws.refreshEnabled` will enable the automatic context reload, `camel.vault.aws.refreshPeriod` is the interval of time between two different checks for update events and `camel.vault.aws.secrets` is a regex representing the secrets we want to track for updates.

Note that `camel.vault.aws.secrets` is not mandatory: if not specified the task responsible for checking updates events will take into accounts or the properties with an `aws:` prefix.

=== Secrets Manager Producer operations

Camel-AWS-Secrets-manager component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listSecrets
- createSecret
- deleteSecret
- describeSecret
- rotateSecret
- getSecret
- updateSecret
- replicateSecretToRegions

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-secrets-manager</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
