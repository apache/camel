*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS Secrets Manager component supports list secret
https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Secrets Manager. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager].


== URI Format

-------------------------
aws-secrets-manager://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...


// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END

=== Using AWS Secrets Manager Property Function

To use this function you'll need to provide credentials to AWS Secrets Manager Service as environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_USE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=accessKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_SECRET_KEY=secretKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_REGION=region
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.accessKey = accessKey
camel.vault.aws.secretKey = secretKey
camel.vault.aws.region = region
----

If you want instead to use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS default credentials provider], you'll need to provide the following env variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_USE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=true
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_REGION=region
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.defaultCredentialsProvider = true
camel.vault.aws.region = region
----

At this point you'll be able to reference a property in the following way:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Where route will be the name of the secret stored in the AWS Secrets Manager Service.

You could specify a default value in case the secret is not present on AWS Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route:default}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist, the property will fallback to "default" as value.

Also you are able to get particular field of the secret, if you have for example a secret named database of this form:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123",
  "engine": "postgres",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3128",
  "dbname": "db"
}
----

You're able to do get single secret value in your route, like for example:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{aws:database/username}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Or re-use the property as part of an endpoint.

You could specify a default value in case the particular field of secret is not present on AWS Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{aws:database/username:admin}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist or the secret exists, but the username field is not part of the secret, the property will fallback to "admin" as value.

For the moment we are not considering the rotation function, if any will be applied, but it is in the work to be done.

The only requirement is adding the camel-aws-secrets-manager jar to your Camel application.

// component headers: END

=== Secrets Manager Producer operations

Camel-AWS-Secrets-manager component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listSecrets
- createSecret
- deleteSecret
- describeSecret
- rotateSecret
- getSecret
- updateSecret
- replicateSecretToRegions

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-secrets-manager</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
