The Simple Workflow component supports managing workflows from
http://aws.amazon.com/swf/[Amazon's Simple Workflow] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Simple Workflow. More information are available
at http://aws.amazon.com/swf/[Amazon Simple Workflow].

Required SWF component options

You have to provide the amazonSWClient in the
link:registry.html[Registry] or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the http://aws.amazon.com/swf[Amazon's Simple Workflow Service].

### Usage

#### Message headers evaluated by the SWF Workflow Producer

A workflow producer allows interacting with a workflow. It can start a
new workflow execution, query its state, send signals to a running
workflow, or terminate and cancel it.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelSWFOperation` |`String` |The operation to perform on the workflow. Supported operations are:  +
 SIGNAL, CANCEL, TERMINATE, GET_STATE, START, DESCRIBE, GET_HISTORY.

|`CamelSWFWorkflowId` |`String` |A workflow ID to use.

|`CamelAwsDdbKeyCamelSWFRunId` |`String` |A worfklow run ID to use.

|`CamelSWFStateResultType` |`String` |The type of the result when a workflow state is queried.

|`CamelSWFEventName` |`String` |The workflow or activity event name to use.

|`CamelSWFVersion` |`String` |The workflow or activity event version to use.

|`CamelSWFReason` |`String` |The reason for terminating a workflow.

|`CamelSWFDetails` |`String` |Details for terminating a workflow.

|`CamelSWFChildPolicy` |`String` |The policy to use on child workflows when terminating a workflow.
|=======================================================================

#### Message headers set by the SWF Workflow Producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelSWFWorkflowId` |`String` |The worfklow ID used or newly generated.

|`CamelAwsDdbKeyCamelSWFRunId` |`String` |The worfklow run ID used or generated.
|=======================================================================

#### Message headers set by the SWF Workflow Consumer

A workflow consumer represents the workflow logic. When it is started,
it will start polling workflow decision tasks and process them. In
addition to processing decision tasks, a workflow consumer route, will
also receive signals (send from a workflow producer) or state queries.
The primary purpose of a workflow consumer is to schedule activity tasks
for execution using activity producers. Actually activity tasks can be
scheduled only from a thread started by a workflow consumer.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelSWFAction` |`String` |Indicates what type is the current event: CamelSWFActionExecute,
CamelSWFSignalReceivedAction or CamelSWFGetStateAction.

|`CamelSWFWorkflowReplaying` |`boolean` |Indicates whether the current decision task is a replay or not.

|`CamelSWFWorkflowStartTime` |`long` |The time of the start event for this decision task.
|=======================================================================

#### Message headers set by the SWF Activity Producer

An activity producer allows scheduling activity tasks. An activity
producer can be used only from a thread started by a workflow consumer
ie, it can process synchronous exchanges started by a workflow consumer.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelSWFEventName` |`String` |The activity name to schedule.

|`CamelSWFVersion` |`String` |The activity version to schedule.
|=======================================================================

#### Message headers set by the SWF Activity Consumer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelSWFTaskToken` |`String` |The task token that is required to report task completion for manually
completed tasks.
|=======================================================================

#### Advanced amazonSWClient configuration

If you need more control over the AmazonSimpleWorkflowClient instance
configuration you can create your own instance and refer to it from the
URI:

The `#client` refers to a AmazonSimpleWorkflowClient in the
link:registry.html[Registry].

For example if your Camel Application is running behind a firewall:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");
ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonSimpleWorkflowClient client = new AmazonSimpleWorkflowClient(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel
(2.13 or higher).
