Required S3 component options

You have to provide the amazonS3Client in the
link:registry.html[Registry] or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the http://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon's S3].

[[AWS-S3-BatchConsumer]]
Batch Consumer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component implements the link:batch-consumer.html[Batch Consumer].

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the link:aggregator.html[Aggregator]
aggregate this number of messages.

[[AWS-S3-AdvancedAmazonS3configuration]]
Advanced AmazonS3 configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the `AmazonS3` instance configuration, you can
create your own instance:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");

ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonS3 client = new AmazonS3Client(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and refer to it in your Camel aws-s3 component configuration:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-s3://MyBucket?amazonS3Client=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[AWS-S3-Dependencies]]
Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel
(2.8 or higher).
