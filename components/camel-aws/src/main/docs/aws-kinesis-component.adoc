== AWS Kinesis Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.17*

The Kinesis component supports receiving messages from and sending messages to Amazon Kinesis
service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Kinesis. More information are available
atÂ http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/[AWS Kinesis]

### URI Format

[source,java]
-----------------------------------
aws-kinesis://stream-name[?options]
-----------------------------------

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

### URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Kinesis component supports 5 options, which are listed below.

// endpoint options: START
The AWS Kinesis endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-kinesis:streamName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *streamName* | *Required* Name of the stream |  | String
|===


==== Query Parameters (30 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type

| *proxyPort* (common) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the DDBStreams client |  | Integer
| *region* (common) | The region in which Kinesis client needs to work |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *iteratorType* (consumer) | Defines where in the Kinesis stream to start getting records | TRIM_HORIZON | ShardIteratorType
| *maxResultsPerRequest* (consumer) | Maximum number of records that will be fetched in each poll | 1 | int
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *sequenceNumber* (consumer) | The sequence number to start polling from. Required if iteratorType is set to AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER or AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER |  | String
| *shardClosed* (consumer) | Define what will be the behavior in case of shard closed. Possible value are ignore, silent and fail.In case of ignore a message will be logged and the consumer will restart from the beginning,in case of silent there will be no logging and the consumer will start from the beginning,in case of fail a ReachedClosedStateException will be raised | ignore | KinesisShardClosed StrategyEnum
| *shardId* (consumer) | Defines which shardId in the Kinesis stream to get records from |  | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPoll Strategy

| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutor Service
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz2 component | none | ScheduledPollConsumer Scheduler
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz2, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map

Required Kinesis component options

You have to provide theÂ amazonKinesisClient in the
Registry with proxies and relevant credentials
configured.

### Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

### Usage

#### Message headers set by the Kinesis consumer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKinesisSequenceNumber` |`String` |The sequence number of the record. This is represented as a String as it
size is not defined by the API. If it is to be used as a numerical type then use

|`CamelAwsKinesisApproximateArrivalTimestamp` |`String` |The time AWS assigned as the arrival time of the record.

|`CamelAwsKinesisPartitionKey` |`String` |Identifies which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to.
|=======================================================================

#### AmazonKinesis configuration

You will need to create an instance of AmazonKinesisClient and
bind it to the registry

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

Region region = Region.getRegion(Regions.fromName(region));
region.createClient(AmazonKinesisClient.class, null, clientConfiguration);
// the 'null' here is the AWSCredentialsProvider which defaults to an instance of DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain

registry.bind("kinesisClient", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You then have to reference the AmazonKinesisClient in the `amazonKinesisClient` URI option.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-kinesis://mykinesisstream?amazonKinesisClient=#kinesisClient")
  .to("log:out?showAll=true");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Providing AWS Credentials

It is recommended that the credentials are obtained by using the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html[DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain]
that is the default when creating a new ClientConfiguration instance,
however, a
differentÂ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/AWSCredentialsProvider.html[AWSCredentialsProvider]
can be specified when calling createClient(...).

#### Message headers used by the Kinesis producer to write to Kinesis.  The producer expects that the message body is a `byte[]`.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKinesisPartitionKey` |`String` |The PartitionKey to pass to Kinesis to store this record.

|`CamelAwsKinesisSequenceNumber` |`String` |Optional paramter to indicate the sequence number of this record.

|=======================================================================

#### Message headers set by the Kinesis producer on successful storage of a Record

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKinesisSequenceNumber` |`String` |The sequence number of the record, as defined in
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html#API_PutRecord_ResponseSyntax[Response Syntax]

|`CamelAwsKinesisShardId` |`String` |The shard ID of where the Record was stored


|=======================================================================

### Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel
(2.17 or higher).
