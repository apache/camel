*Available as of Camel version 2.6*

The sqs component supports sending and receiving messages to
http://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon SQS. More information are available at
http://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon SQS].

| *attributeNames* (consumer) | A list of attribute names to receive when consuming. Multiple names can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

| *queueUrl* (advanced) | To define the queueUrl explicitly. All other parameters, which would influence the queueUrl, are ignored. This parameter is intended to be used, to connect to a mock implementation of SQS, for testing purposes. |  | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int

Required SQS component options

You have to provide the amazonSQSClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the http://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS].

### Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

### Usage

#### Message headers set by the SQS producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSqsMD5OfBody` |`String` |The MD5 checksum of the Amazon SQS message.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageId` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message ID.

|`CamelAwsSqsDelaySeconds` |`Integer` |Since *Camel 2.11*, the delay seconds that the Amazon SQS message can be
see by others.
|=======================================================================

#### Message headers set by the SQS consumer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSqsMD5OfBody` |`String` |The MD5 checksum of the Amazon SQS message.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageId` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message ID. 

|`CamelAwsSqsReceiptHandle` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message receipt handle.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageAttributes` |`Map<String, String>` |The Amazon SQS message attributes.
|=======================================================================

#### Advanced AmazonSQS configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the AmazonSQS instance configuration, you can
create your own instance:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");

ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonSQS client = new AmazonSQSClient(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and refer to it in your Camel aws-sqs component configuration:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Creating or updating an SQS Queue

In the SQS Component, when an endpoint is started, a check is executed to obtain information 
about the existence of the queue or not. You're able to customize the creation through the QueueAttributeName 
mapping with the SQSConfiguration option.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example if the MyQueue queue is not already created on AWS, it will be created with default parameters from the 
SQS configuration. If it's already up on AWS, the SQS configuration options will be used to override the existent AWS configuration.

#### DelayQueue VS Delay for Single message

From 2.23.0 the component has a new option: delayQueue. When the option is set to true, the SQS Queue will be a DelayQueue with the 
DelaySeconds option as delay. For more information about DelayQueue you can read the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html[AWS SQS documentation].
One important information to take into account is the following:

- For standard queues, the per-queue delay setting is not retroactive—changing the setting doesn't affect the delay of messages already in the queue.
- For FIFO queues, the per-queue delay setting is retroactive—changing the setting affects the delay of messages already in the queue.

as stated in the official documentation. If you want to specify a delay on single messages, you can ignore the delayQueue option, while you can set this option 
to true, if you need to add a fixed delay to all messages enqueued.

### Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel
(2.6 or higher).

### JMS-style Selectors

SQS does not allow selectors, but you can effectively achieve this by
using the Camel Filter EIP and setting an
appropriate `visibilityTimeout`. When SQS dispatches a message, it will
wait up to the visibility timeout before it will try to dispatch the
message to a different consumer unless a DeleteMessage is received. By
default, Camel will always send the DeleteMessage at the end of the
route, unless the route ended in failure. To achieve appropriate
filtering and not send the DeleteMessage even on successful completion
of the route, use a Filter:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&defaultVisibilityTimeout=5000&deleteIfFiltered=false")
.filter("${header.login} == true")
.to("mock:result");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above code, if an exchange doesn't have an appropriate header, it
will not make it through the filter AND also not be deleted from the SQS
queue. After 5000 miliseconds, the message will become visible to other
consumers.
