== AWS Simple Queue Service Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.6*

The sqs component supports sending and receiving messages to
http://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon SQS. More information are available at
http://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon SQS].

### URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws-sqs://queueNameOrArn[?options]
------------------------------

The queue will be created if they don't already exists. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

// endpoint options: START
The AWS Simple Queue Service endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-sqs:queueNameOrArn
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *queueNameOrArn* | *Required* Queue name or ARN |  | String

| *amazonSQSClient* (common) | To use the AmazonSQS as client |  | AmazonSQS
| *amazonSQSEndpoint* (common) | The region with which the AWS-SQS client wants to work with. Only works if Camel creates the AWS-SQS client i.e. if you explicitly set amazonSQSClient then this setting will have no effect. You would have to set it on the client you create directly |  | String
| *headerFilterStrategy* (common) | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to map headers to/from Camel. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *queueOwnerAWSAccountId* (common) | Specify the queue owner aws account id when you need to connect the queue with different account owner. |  | String

| *attributeNames* (consumer) | A list of attribute names to receive when consuming. Multiple names can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row.

// endpoint options: END







Required SQS component options

You have to provide the amazonSQSClient in the
link:registry.html[Registry] or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the http://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS].

### Batch Consumer

This component implements the link:batch-consumer.html[Batch Consumer].

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the link:aggregator.html[Aggregator]
aggregate this number of messages.

### Usage

#### Message headers set by the SQS producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSqsMD5OfBody` |`String` |The MD5 checksum of the Amazon SQS message.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageId` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message ID.

|`CamelAwsSqsDelaySeconds` |`Integer` |Since *Camel 2.11*, the delay seconds that the Amazon SQS message can be
see by others.
|=======================================================================

#### Message headers set by the SQS consumer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSqsMD5OfBody` |`String` |The MD5 checksum of the Amazon SQS message.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageId` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message ID. 

|`CamelAwsSqsReceiptHandle` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message receipt handle.

|`CamelAwsSqsAttributes` |`Map<String, String>` |The Amazon SQS message attributes.
|=======================================================================

#### Advanced AmazonSQS configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the AmazonSQS instance configuration, you can
create your own instance:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");

ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonSQS client = new AmazonSQSClient(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and refer to it in your Camel aws-sqs component configuration:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel
(2.6 or higher).

### JMS-style Selectors

SQS does not allow selectors, but you can effectively achieve this by
using the link:message-filter.html[Camel Filter EIP] and setting an
appropriate `visibilityTimeout`. When SQS dispatches a message, it will
wait up to the visibility timeout before it will try to dispatch the
message to a different consumer unless a DeleteMessage is received. By
default, Camel will always send the DeleteMessage at the end of the
route, unless the route ended in failure. To achieve appropriate
filtering and not send the DeleteMessage even on successful completion
of the route, use a Filter:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&defaultVisibilityTimeout=5000&deleteIfFiltered=false")
.filter("${header.login} == true")
.to("mock:result");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above code, if an exchange doesn't have an appropriate header, it
will not make it through the filter AND also not be deleted from the SQS
queue. After 5000 miliseconds, the message will become visible to other
consumers.
