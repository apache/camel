*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 SQS component supports sending and receiving messages to
https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon SQS. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon SQS].

== URI Format

------------------------------
aws2-sqs://queueNameOrArn[?options]
------------------------------

The queue will be created if they don't already exists. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...


// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END


Required SQS component options

You have to provide the amazonSQSClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS].

== Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

== Usage

=== Static credentials, Default Credential Provider and Profile Credentials Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static credentials, by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and set it to true.

The order of evaluation for Default Credentials Provider is the following:

 - Java system properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey
 - Environment variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
 - Web Identity Token from AWS STS.
 - The shared credentials and config files.
 - Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the environment variable AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI is set.
 - Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials. 
 
You have also the possibility of using Profile Credentials Provider, by specifying the useProfileCredentialsProvider option to true and profileCredentialsName to the profile name.

Only one of static, default and profile credentials could be used at the same time.

For more information about this you can look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS credentials documentation]

=== Advanced AmazonSQS configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the SqsClient instance configuration, you can
create your own instance, and configure Camel to use your instance by the bean id.

In the example below we use _myClient_ as the bean id:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// crate my own instance of SqsClient
SqsClient sqs = ...

// register the client into Camel registry
camelContext.getRegistry().bind("myClient", sqs);

// refer to the custom client via myClient as the bean id
from("aws2-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#m4yClient&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== DelayQueue VS Delay for Single message

When the option delayQueue is set to true, the SQS Queue will be a DelayQueue with the
DelaySeconds option as delay. For more information about DelayQueue you can read the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html[AWS SQS documentation].
One important information to take into account is the following:

- For standard queues, the per-queue delay setting is not retroactive—changing the setting doesn't affect the delay of messages already in the queue.
- For FIFO queues, the per-queue delay setting is retroactive—changing the setting affects the delay of messages already in the queue.

as stated in the official documentation. If you want to specify a delay on single messages, you can ignore the delayQueue option, while you can set this option 
to true, if you need to add a fixed delay to all messages enqueued.

=== Server Side Encryption

There is a set of Server Side Encryption attributes for a queue. The related option are serverSideEncryptionEnabled, keyMasterKeyId and kmsDataKeyReusePeriod.
The SSE is disabled by default. You need to explicitly set the option to true and set the related parameters as queue attributes.

== JMS-style Selectors

SQS does not allow selectors, but you can effectively achieve this by
using the Camel Filter EIP and setting an
appropriate `visibilityTimeout`. When SQS dispatches a message, it will
wait up to the visibility timeout before it will try to dispatch the
message to a different consumer unless a DeleteMessage is received. By
default, Camel will always send the DeleteMessage at the end of the
route, unless the route ended in failure. To achieve appropriate
filtering and not send the DeleteMessage even on successful completion
of the route, use a Filter:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&defaultVisibilityTimeout=5000&deleteIfFiltered=false&deleteAfterRead=false")
.filter("${header.login} == true")
  .setProperty(Sqs2Constants.SQS_DELETE_FILTERED, constant(true))
  .to("mock:filter");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above code, if an exchange doesn't have an appropriate header, it
will not make it through the filter AND also not be deleted from the SQS
queue. After 5000 milliseconds, the message will become visible to other
consumers.

Note we must set the property `Sqs2Constants.SQS_DELETE_FILTERED` to `true` to
instruct Camel to send the DeleteMessage, if being filtered.

== Available Producer Operations
- single message (default)
- sendBatchMessage
- deleteMessage
- listQueues

== Send Message

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setBody(constant("Camel rocks!"))
  .to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=eu-west-1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Send Batch Message

You can set a `SendMessageBatchRequest` or an `Iterable`

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.SQS_OPERATION, constant("sendBatchMessage"))
  .process(new Processor() {
      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          List c = new ArrayList();
          c.add("team1");
          c.add("team2");
          c.add("team3");
          c.add("team4");
          exchange.getIn().setBody(c);					
      }
  })
  .to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=eu-west-1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing a `SendMessageBatchResponse` instance, that you can examinate to check what messages were successfull and what not.
The id set on each message of the batch will be a Random UUID.

== Delete single Message

Use deleteMessage operation to delete a single message. You'll need to set a receipt handle header for the message you want to delete.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.SQS_OPERATION, constant("deleteMessage"))
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.RECEIPT_HANDLE, constant("123456"))
  .to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=eu-west-1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing a `DeleteMessageResponse` instance, that you can use to check if the message was deleted or not.

== List Queues

Use listQueues operation to list queues.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.SQS_OPERATION, constant("listQueues"))
  .to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=eu-west-1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing a `ListQueuesResponse` instance, that you can examinate to check the actual queues.

== Purge Queue

Use purgeQueue operation to purge queue.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.SQS_OPERATION, constant("purgeQueue"))
  .to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=eu-west-1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing a `PurgeQueueResponse` instance.

== Queue Autocreation

With the option `autoCreateQueue` users are able to avoid the autocreation of an SQS Queue in case it doesn't exist. The default for this option is `false`.
If set to false any operation on a not-existent queue in AWS won't be successful and an error will be returned.

== Send Batch Message and Message Deduplication Strategy

In case you're using a SendBatchMessage Operation, you can set two different kind of Message Deduplication Strategy:
- useExchangeId
- useContentBasedDeduplication

The first one will use a ExchangeIdMessageDeduplicationIdStrategy, that will use the Exchange ID as parameter
The other one will use a NullMessageDeduplicationIdStrategy, that will use the body as deduplication element.

In case of send batch message operation, you'll need to use the `useContentBasedDeduplication` and on the Queue you're pointing you'll need to enable the `content based deduplication` option.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-sqs</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
