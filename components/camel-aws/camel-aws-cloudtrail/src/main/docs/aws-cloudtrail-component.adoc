*{component-header}*

The AWS Cloudtrail component supports receiving events from Amazon Cloudtrail
service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Cloudtrail. More information is available
at https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/[AWS Cloudtrail]

== Static credentials, Default Credential Provider and Profile Credentials Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static credentials by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and set it to true.

The order of evaluation for Default Credentials Provider is the following:

 - Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`.
 - Environment variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
 - Web Identity Token from AWS STS.
 - The shared credentials and config files.
 - Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the environment variable `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` is set.
 - Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials. 
 
You have also the possibility of using Profile Credentials Provider, by specifying the useProfileCredentialsProvider option to true and profileCredentialsName to the profile name.

Only one of static, default and profile credentials could be used at the same time.

For more information about this you can look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS credentials documentation]

== Cloudtrail Events consumed

The Cloudtrail consumer will use an API method called LookupEvents.

This method will only take into account management events like create/update/delete of resources and Cloudtrail insight events where enabled.

This means you won't consume the events registered in the Cloudtrail logs stored on S3, in case of creation of a new Trail.

This is important to notice, and it must be taken into account when using this component.

== URI Format

-----------------------------------
aws-cloudtrail://label[?options]
-----------------------------------

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format:

`?options=value&option2=value&...`
