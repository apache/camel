## Printer Component

*Available as of Camel 2.1*

The *printer* component provides a way to direct payloads on a route to
a printer. Obviously the payload has to be a formatted piece of payload
in order for the component to appropriately print it. The objective is
to be able to direct specific payloads as jobs to a line printer in a
camel flow.

This component only supports a camel producer endpoint.

The functionality allows for the payload to be printed on a default
printer, named local, remote or wirelessly linked printer using the
javax printing API under the covers.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-printer</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

Since the URI scheme for a printer has not been standardized (the
nearest thing to a standard being the IETF print standard) and therefore
not uniformly applied by vendors, we have chosen *"lpr"* as the scheme.

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
lpr://localhost/default[?options]
lpr://remotehost:port/path/to/printer[?options]
-----------------------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options


// component options: START
The Printer component has no options.
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Printer component supports 14 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| hostname | producer |  | String | *Required* Hostname of the printer
| port | producer |  | int | Port number of the printer
| printername | producer |  | String | Name of the printer
| copies | producer | 1 | int | Number of copies to print
| docFlavor | producer |  | DocFlavor | Sets DocFlavor to use.
| flavor | producer |  | String | Sets DocFlavor to use.
| mediaSize | producer | na-letter | String | Sets the stationary as defined by enumeration names in the javax.print.attribute.standard.MediaSizeName API. The default setting is to use North American Letter sized stationary. The value's case is ignored e.g. values of iso_a4 and ISO_A4 may be used.
| mediaTray | producer |  | String | Sets MediaTray supported by the javax.print.DocFlavor API for example uppermiddle etc.
| mimeType | producer |  | String | Sets mimeTypes supported by the javax.print.DocFlavor API
| orientation | producer | portrait | String | Sets the page orientation.
| printerPrefix | producer |  | String | Sets the prefix name of the printer it is useful when the printer name does not start with //hostname/printer
| sendToPrinter | producer | true | boolean | etting this option to false prevents sending of the print data to the printer
| sides | producer | one-sided | String | Sets one sided or two sided printing based on the javax.print.attribute.standard.Sides API
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).

### Sending Messages to a Printer

#### Printer Producer

Sending data to the printer is very straightforward and involves
creating a producer endpoint that can be sent message exchanges on in
route.

### Usage Samples

#### Example 1: Printing text based payloads on a Default printer using letter stationary and one-sided mode

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
       from(file://inputdir/?delete=true)
       .to("lpr://localhost/default?copies=2" +
           "&flavor=DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM&" +
           "&mimeType=AUTOSENSE" +
           "&mediaSize=NA_LETTER" +
           "&sides=one-sided")
    }};
-----------------------------------------------

#### Example 2: Printing GIF based payloads on a Remote printer using A4 stationary and one-sided mode

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
       from(file://inputdir/?delete=true)
       .to("lpr://remotehost/sales/salesprinter" +
           "?copies=2&sides=one-sided" +
           "&mimeType=GIF&mediaSize=ISO_A4" +
           "&flavor=DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM")
   }};
--------------------------------------------------

#### Example 3: Printing JPEG based payloads on a Remote printer using Japanese Postcard stationary and one-sided mode

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
       from(file://inputdir/?delete=true)
       .to("lpr://remotehost/sales/salesprinter" +
           "?copies=2&sides=one-sided" +
           "&mimeType=JPEG" +
           "&mediaSize=JAPANESE_POSTCARD" +
           "&flavor=DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM")
    }};
