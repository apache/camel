= Saga Component

*Since Camel 2.21*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Saga component provides a bridge to execute custom actions within a route using the Saga EIP.

The component should be used for advanced tasks, such as deciding to complete or compensate a Saga
with completionMode set to *MANUAL*.

Refer to the Saga EIP documentation for help on using sagas in common scenarios.

== Options

// component options: START
The Saga component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Saga endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
saga:action

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *action* | *Required* Action to execute (complete or compensate) |  | SagaEndpointAction

=== Query Parameters (3 parameters):

| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-saga-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

The component supports 4 options, which are listed below.

| *camel.component.saga.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the saga component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
