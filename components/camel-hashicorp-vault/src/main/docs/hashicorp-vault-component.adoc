=== Using Hashicorp Vault Property Function

To use this function you'll need to provide credentials for Hashicorp vault as environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_TOKEN=token
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_ENGINE=secretKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_HOST=host
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_PORT=port
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_SCHEME=http/https
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.hashicorp.token = token
camel.vault.hashicorp.engine = engine
camel.vault.hashicorp.host = host
camel.vault.hashicorp.port = port
camel.vault.hashicorp.scheme = scheme
----

At this point you'll be able to reference a property in the following way:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Where route will be the name of the secret stored in the Hashicorp Vault instance.

You could specify a default value in case the secret is not present on Hashicorp Vault instance:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route:default}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist, the property will fallback to "default" as value.

Also you are able to get particular field of the secret, if you have for example a secret named database of this form:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123",
  "engine": "postgres",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3128",
  "dbname": "db"
}
----

You're able to do get single secret value in your route, like for example:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{hashicorp:database/username}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Or re-use the property as part of an endpoint.

You could specify a default value in case the particular field of secret is not present on Hashicorp Vault instance:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{hashicorp:database/username:admin}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist or the secret exists, but the username field is not part of the secret, the property will fallback to "admin" as value.

There is also the syntax to get a particular version of the secret for both the approach, with field/default value specified or only with secret:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route@2}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the RAW route secret with version '2'.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route:default@2}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the route secret value with version '2' or default value in case the secret doesn't exist or the version doesn't exist.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{hashicorp:database/username:admin@2}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the username field of the database secret with version '2' or admin in case the secret doesn't exist or the version doesn't exist.

For the moment we are not considering the rotation function, if any will be applied, but it is in the work to be done.

The only requirement is adding the camel-hashicorp-vault jar to your Camel application.
