= Hazelcast Ringbuffer Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.16*

The http://www.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast] ringbuffer component is one of Camel Hazelcast Components which allows you to access Hazelcast ringbuffer.
Ringbuffer is a distributed data structure where the data is stored in a ring-like structure. You can think of it as a circular array with a certain capacity. 

== Options

// component options: START
The Hazelcast Ringbuffer component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *hazelcastInstance* (advanced) | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. |  | HazelcastInstance
| *hazelcastMode* (advanced) | The hazelcast mode reference which kind of instance should be used. If you don't specify the mode, then the node mode will be the default. | node | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The Hazelcast Ringbuffer endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
hazelcast-ringbuffer:cacheName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *cacheName* | *Required* The name of the cache |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (12 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *reliable* (common) | Define if the endpoint will use a reliable Topic struct or not. | false | boolean
| *defaultOperation* (producer) | To specify a default operation to use, if no operation header has been provided. |  | HazelcastOperation
| *hazelcastInstance* (producer) | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. |  | HazelcastInstance
| *hazelcastInstanceName* (producer) | The hazelcast instance reference name which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *concurrentConsumers* (seda) | To use concurrent consumers polling from the SEDA queue. | 1 | int
| *onErrorDelay* (seda) | Milliseconds before consumer continues polling after an error has occurred. | 1000 | int
| *pollTimeout* (seda) | The timeout used when consuming from the SEDA queue. When a timeout occurs, the consumer can check whether it is allowed to continue running. Setting a lower value allows the consumer to react more quickly upon shutdown. | 1000 | int
| *transacted* (seda) | If set to true then the consumer runs in transaction mode, where the messages in the seda queue will only be removed if the transaction commits, which happens when the processing is complete. | false | boolean
| *transferExchange* (seda) | If set to true the whole Exchange will be transfered. If header or body contains not serializable objects, they will be skipped. | false | boolean

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-hazelcast-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 6 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.hazelcast-ringbuffer.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.hazelcast-ringbuffer.customizer.hazelcast-instance.enabled* | Enable or disable the cache-manager customizer. | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.hazelcast-ringbuffer.customizer.hazelcast-instance.override* | Configure if the cache manager eventually set on the component should be overridden by the customizer. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.hazelcast-ringbuffer.enabled* | Enable hazelcast-ringbuffer component | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.hazelcast-ringbuffer.hazelcast-instance* | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. The option is a com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance type. |  | String
| *camel.component.hazelcast-ringbuffer.hazelcast-mode* | The hazelcast mode reference which kind of instance should be used. If you don't specify the mode, then the node mode will be the default. | node | String

== ringbuffer cache producer 

The ringbuffer producer provides 5 operations:
* add
* readonceHead
* readonceTail
* remainingCapacity
* capacity

Header Variables for the request message:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description

|`CamelHazelcastOperationType` |`String` |valid values are: put, get, removevalue, delete

|`CamelHazelcastObjectId` |`String` |the object id to store / find your object inside the cache

from("direct:put")
.setHeader(HazelcastConstants.OPERATION, constant(HazelcastOperation.ADD))
.to(String.format("hazelcast-%sbar", HazelcastConstants.RINGBUFFER_PREFIX));

Spring DSL:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="direct:put" />
    <log message="put.."/>
    <setHeader name="hazelcast.operation.type">
        <constant>add</constant>
    </setHeader>
    <to uri="hazelcast-ringbuffer:foo" />
</route>

from("direct:get")
.setHeader(HazelcastConstants.OPERATION, constant(HazelcastOperation.READ_ONCE_HEAD))
.toF("hazelcast-%sbar", HazelcastConstants.RINGBUFFER_PREFIX)
