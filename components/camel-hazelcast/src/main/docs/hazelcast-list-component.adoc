= Hazelcast List Component

*Since Camel 2.7*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The http://www.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast] List component is one of Camel Hazelcast Components which allows you to access Hazelcast distributed list.

== Options

// component options: START
The Hazelcast List component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *hazelcastInstance* (advanced) | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. |  | HazelcastInstance
| *hazelcastMode* (advanced) | The hazelcast mode reference which kind of instance should be used. If you don't specify the mode, then the node mode will be the default. | node | String
|===
// component options: END
// endpoint options: START
The Hazelcast List endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
hazelcast-list:cacheName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *cacheName* | *Required* The name of the cache |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *defaultOperation* (common) | To specify a default operation to use, if no operation header has been provided. The value can be one of: put, delete, get, update, query, getAll, clear, putIfAbsent, allAll, removeAll, retainAll, evict, evictAll, valueCount, containsKey, containsValue, keySet, removevalue, increment, decrement, setvalue, destroy, compareAndSet, getAndAdd, add, offer, peek, poll, remainingCapacity, drainTo, removeIf, take, publish, readOnceHeal, readOnceTail, capacity |  | HazelcastOperation
| *hazelcastInstance* (common) | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. |  | HazelcastInstance
| *hazelcastInstanceName* (common) | The hazelcast instance reference name which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don't specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

== List producer – to(“hazelcast-list:foo”)

The list producer provides 7 operations:
* add
* addAll
* set
* get
* removevalue
* removeAll
* clear

=== Sample for *add*:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:add")
.setHeader(HazelcastConstants.OPERATION, constant(HazelcastOperation.ADD))
.toF("hazelcast-%sbar", HazelcastConstants.LIST_PREFIX);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Sample for *get*:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:get")
.setHeader(HazelcastConstants.OPERATION, constant(HazelcastOperation.GET))
.toF("hazelcast-%sbar", HazelcastConstants.LIST_PREFIX)
.to("seda:out");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Sample for *setvalue*:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:set")
.setHeader(HazelcastConstants.OPERATION, constant(HazelcastOperation.SET_VALUE))
.toF("hazelcast-%sbar", HazelcastConstants.LIST_PREFIX);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Sample for *removevalue*:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:removevalue")
.setHeader(HazelcastConstants.OPERATION, constant(HazelcastOperation.REMOVE_VALUE))
.toF("hazelcast-%sbar", HazelcastConstants.LIST_PREFIX);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that *CamelHazelcastObjectIndex* header is used for indexing
purpose.


== List consumer – from(“hazelcast-list:foo”)

The list consumer provides 2 operations:
* add
* remove

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fromF("hazelcast-%smm", HazelcastConstants.LIST_PREFIX)
    .log("object...")
    .choice()
        .when(header(HazelcastConstants.LISTENER_ACTION).isEqualTo(HazelcastConstants.ADDED))
            .log("...added")
                        .to("mock:added")
        .when(header(HazelcastConstants.LISTENER_ACTION).isEqualTo(HazelcastConstants.REMOVED))
            .log("...removed")
                        .to("mock:removed")
                .otherwise()
                        .log("fail!");
