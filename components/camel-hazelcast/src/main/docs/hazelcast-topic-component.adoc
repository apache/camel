The http://www.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast] Topic component is one of Camel Hazelcast Components which allows you to access Hazelcast distributed topic.


== Options

// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END


== Topic producer – to(“hazelcast-topic:foo”)

The topic producer provides only one operation (publish).

// component headers: START
include::partial$component-endpoint-headers.adoc[]
// component headers: END

=== Sample for *publish*:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:add")
.setHeader(HazelcastConstants.OPERATION, constant(HazelcastOperation.PUBLISH))
.toF("hazelcast-%sbar", HazelcastConstants.PUBLISH_OPERATION);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Topic consumer – from(“hazelcast-topic:foo”)

The topic consumer provides only one operation (received). This
component is supposed to support multiple consumption as it's expected
when it comes to topics so you are free to have as much consumers as you
need on the same hazelcast topic.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fromF("hazelcast-%sfoo", HazelcastConstants.TOPIC_PREFIX)
  .choice()
    .when(header(HazelcastConstants.LISTENER_ACTION).isEqualTo(HazelcastConstants.RECEIVED))
      .log("...message received")
    .otherwise()
      .log("...this should never have happened")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
