*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Knative component provides support for interacting with https://knative.dev/[Knative].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component.

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-knative</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel K version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,text]
----
knative:type/name[?options]
----

You can append query options to the URI in the following format:

[source,text]
------------------------------------------------------------
?option=value&option=value&...
------------------------------------------------------------

== Options

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END
// component-configure options: START
// component-configure options: END
// endpoint options: START
// endpoint options: END


== Supported Knative resources

The component support the following Knative resources you can target or exposes using the `type` path parameter:

- **channel** allow producing or consuming events to or from a https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/channels/[**Knative Channel**]
- **endpoint** allow exposing or targeting serverless workloads using https://knative.dev/docs/serving/spec/knative-api-specification-1.0/#service[**Knative Services**]
- **event** allow producing or consuming events to or from a https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker[**Knative Broker**]

== Knative Environment

As the Knative component hides the technical details of how to communicate with Knative services to the user (protocols, addresses, etc.), it needs some metadata that describe the Knative environment to set-up the low level transport details. In order to do so, the component needs a so called `Knative Environment` which is essence is a Json document made by a number of `service` elements which looks like the below example:

[source,json]
------------------------------------------------------------
{
    "services": [
        {
             "type": "channel|endpoint|event", <1>
             "name": "", <2>
             "metadata": {
                 "service.url": "http://my-service.svc.cluster.local" <3>
                 "knative.event.type": "", <4>
                 "camel.endpoint.kind": "source|sink", <5>
             }
        }, {
            ...
        }
    ]
}
------------------------------------------------------------
<1> the type of the Knative resource
<2> the name of the resource
<3> the url of the service to invoke (for producer only)
<4> the Knative event type received or produced by the component
<5> the type of the Camel Endpoint associated to this Knative resource (source=consumer, sink=producer)

The `metadata` fields has some additional advanced fields:

[width="100%",cols="1,5,3",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Example
| *filter.*
| The prefix to define filters to be applied to the incoming message headers.
| ```filter.ce.source=my-source```

| *knative.kind*
| The type of the k8s resource referenced by the endpoint.
| ```knative.kind=InMemoryChannel```

| *knative.apiVersion*
| The version of the k8s resource referenced by the endpoint
| ```knative.apiVersion=messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1```

| *knative.reply*
| If the consumer should construct a full reply to knative request.
| ```knative.reply=false```

| *ce.override.*
| The prefix to define CloudEvents values that have to be overridden.
| ```ce.override.ce-type=MyType```

|===

== Example

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();

KnativeComponent component = context.getComponent("knative", KnativeComponent.class);
component.getConfiguration().setEnvironmentPath("classpath:knative.json"); // <1>

RouteBuilder.addRoutes(context, b -> {
    b.from("knative:endpoint/myEndpoint") // <2>
        .to("log:info");
});
----
<1> set the location of the `Knative Environment` file
<2> expose knative service

== Using custom Knative Transport

As today the component only support `http` as transport as it is the only supported protocol on Knative side but the transport is pluggable by implementing the following interface:

[source,java]
----

public interface KnativeTransport extends Service {
    /**
     * Create a camel {@link org.apache.camel.Producer} in place of the original endpoint for a specific protocol.
     *
     * @param endpoint the endpoint for which the producer should be created
     * @param configuration the general transport configuration
     * @param service the service definition containing information about how make reach the target service.
     */
    Producer createProducer(
        Endpoint endpoint,
        KnativeTransportConfiguration configuration,
        KnativeEnvironment.KnativeServiceDefinition service);

    /**
     * Create a camel {@link org.apache.camel.Producer} in place of the original endpoint for a specific protocol.
     *
     * @param endpoint the endpoint for which the consumer should be created.
     * @param configuration the general transport configuration
     * @param service the service definition containing information about how make the route reachable from knative.
     */
    Consumer createConsumer(
        Endpoint endpoint,
        KnativeTransportConfiguration configuration,
        KnativeEnvironment.KnativeServiceDefinition service, Processor processor);
}
----

== Using ProducerTemplate
When using Knative producer with a ProducerTemplate, it is necessary to specify a value for the CloudEvent source, simply by setting a value for the header 'CamelCloudEventSource'.

=== Example

[source,java]
----
producerTemplate.sendBodyAndHeader("knative:event/broker-test", body, CloudEvent.CAMEL_CLOUD_EVENT_SOURCE, "my-source-name");
----
