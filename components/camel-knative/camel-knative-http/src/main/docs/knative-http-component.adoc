The `camel-knative-http` module represents the HTTP transport for the `camel-knative` component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component.

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-knative-http</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel version -->
</dependency>

== Knative Http producer factory

The Knative Http producer factory creates the producer instances that connect to the Knative broker via Http transport.
The factory provides some configuration options that you can set to customize the Http connections and the way the client sends requests to the broker.

First of all the producer factory performs a lookup on the Vertx instance and the VertxOptions, so you can customize these resources and bind them to the Camel context prior to using the Kntive component.

.Example
[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.core.VertxOptions;

VertxOptions options = new VertxOptions();
context.getRegistry().bind("vertxOptions", options);

Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx(options);
context.getRegistry().bind("vertxInstance", vertx);
----

In the very same manner you may also bind the Vertx web client options to the Camel context.
The producer factory will automatically perform the lookup of the options instance.

.Example
[source,java]
----
import io.vertx.ext.web.client.WebClientOptions;

WebClientOptions clientOptions = new WebClientOptions().setConnectTimeout(120000);
context.getRegistry().bind("myClientOptions", clientOptions);
----

You may also explicitly set the options instance via property configuration:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
camel.component.knative.producerFactory.clientOptions=#bean:myClientOptions
----

This is a good option when you have multiple options instances available in the Camel context.
Read more about property binding configuration in the chapter xref:manual::property-binding.adoc[Property Binding].

=== Knative client SSL support

The Knative broker may use secure connections using TLS authentication with CA certificates.
The Apache Camel Knative component supports special web client options to easily enable SSL when connecting to the Knative broker.

You can set the client options on the Knative Http producer factory as follows:

.Example
[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.component.knative.KnativeComponent;
import org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeSslClientOptions;
import org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeHttpProducerFactory;

KnativeSslClientOptions sslClientOptions = new KnativeSslClientOptions(context);
sslClientOptions.setSslEnabled(true);
sslClientOptions.setKeyPath("keystore/client.pem");
sslClientOptions.setKeyCertPath("keystore/client.crt");
sslClientOptions.setTrustCertPath("keystore/trust.crt");

KnativeComponent component = context.getComponent("knative", KnativeComponent.class);
if (component.getProducerFactory() instanceof KnativeHttpProducerFactory httpProducerFactory) {
    httpProducerFactory.setClientOptions(sslClientOptions);
}
----

You can also use property based component configuration to set the client options on the producer factory:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
camel.component.knative.producerFactory.clientOptions=#bean:myClientOptions
----

TIP: When there is no proper trust certificate available (e.g. on test environments) you can use a trust all strategy on the client options with the class `org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.TrustAllOptions`.

.TrustAllOptions
[source,java]
----
sslClientOptions.setTrustOptions(TrustAllOptions.INSTANCE);
----

==== Autoconfigure SSL options via environment variables

The Knative client options are able to perform autoconfiguration based on resolving properties from system property or environment variable settings.
During the initialization phase the client options automatically look for environment settings that configure the options.

All environment settings that configure the Knative client SSL options use a specific property key prefix

* camel.knative.client.ssl.<property_name>
* CAMEL_KNATIVE_CLIENT_SSL_<PROPERTY_NAME>

You can use this kind of autoconfiguration to enable SSL on the Knative client with property based config only.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
camel.knative.client.ssl.enabled=true
camel.knative.client.ssl.key.path=keystore/client.pem
camel.knative.client.ssl.key.cert.path=keystore/client.crt

camel.component.knative.producerFactory.clientOptions=#class:org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeSslClientOptions
----

This will instantiate a new instance of `org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeSslClientOptions` and perform the autoconfiguration via system property and environment variable settings on that instance.

TIP: By default, the SSL client options will verify the hostname of the Knative broker as part of the SSL handshake.
In test environments this often leads to SSL handshake errors. You can disable the hostname verification for the client options with `camel.knative.client.ssl.verify.hostname=false`

The same autoconfiguration works with environment variables which is very useful when set on Kubernetes deployments.

.Deployment

  name: my-camel-app

    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: my-camel-app

            value: "true"
          - name: CAMEL_KNATIVE_CLIENT_SSL_KEY_CERT_PATH
            value: /knative-certs/knative-eventing-bundle.pem
----

=== OpenID Connect support

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity authentication protocol that works with OAuth 2.0 to standardize the process for authenticating and authorizing users.

Knative eventing supports OIDC access tokens that get injected as part of a `SinkBinding` resource. The injection is done in the form of a volume mount on the sink binding subject (usually the app deployment).

This means the OIDC access token is mounted as a file into the application container so Camel client may read the token and set proper `Authorization` Http headers on each request.

You need to enable OIDC support on the Knative Http client in the options like this:

.Example
[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.component.knative.KnativeComponent;
import org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeOidcClientOptions;
import org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeHttpProducerFactory;

KnativeOidcClientOptions oidcClientOptions = new KnativeOidcClientOptions(context);
oidcClientOptions.setOidcEnabled(true);
oidcClientOptions.setOidcTokenPath("oidc/token");

KnativeComponent component = context.getComponent("knative", KnativeComponent.class);
if (component.getProducerFactory() instanceof KnativeHttpProducerFactory httpProducerFactory) {
    httpProducerFactory.setClientOptions(oidcClientOptions);
}
----

As a result each request of the Knative client will have an `Authorization` Http header with the access token.

==== Autoconfigure OIDC options via environment variables

The Knative client options are able to perform autoconfiguration based on resolving properties from system property or environment variable settings.
During the initialization phase the client automatically looks for environment settings that configure the options.

All environment settings that configure the Knative client OIDC options use a specific property key prefix

* camel.knative.client.oidc.<property_name>
* CAMEL_KNATIVE_CLIENT_OIDC_<PROPERTY_NAME>

You can use this kind of autoconfiguration to enable OIDC on the Knative client with property based config only.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
camel.knative.client.oidc.enabled=true
camel.knative.client.oidc.token.path=oidc/token

camel.component.knative.producerFactory.clientOptions=#class:org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeOidcClientOptions
----

This will instantiate a new instance of `org.apache.camel.component.knative.http.KnativeOidcClientOptions` and perform the autoconfiguration via system property and environment variable settings on that instance.

=== OIDC token renewal

The OIDC tokens may expire and get renewed by Knative eventing. The renewal means that the volume mount is updated with the new token automatically.

In order to refresh the token the Camel Knative client must read the token again.
The Knative client options supports the token renewal on a `401 forbidden` response from the Knative broker.

Once the client has received the forbidden answer it automatically reloads the token from the volume mount to perform the renewal.

As an alternative to that you may disable the token cache on the client so the token is always read from the volume mount for each request.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
camel.knative.client.oidc.enabled=true
camel.knative.client.oidc.token.path=oidc/token

camel.knative.client.oidc.renew.tokens.on.forbidden=false
camel.knative.client.oidc.cache.tokens=false
----
