### JMS Component

[TIP]
====
*Using ActiveMQ*

If you are using http://activemq.apache.org/[Apache ActiveMQ], you
should prefer the link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] component as it has been
optimized for link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ]. All of the options and
samples on this page are also valid for the link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ]
component.
====

[NOTE]
====
*Transacted and caching*

See section _Transactions and Cache Levels_ below if you are using
transactions with link:jms.html[JMS] as it can impact performance.
====

[NOTE]
====
*Request/Reply over JMS*

Make sure to read the section _Request-reply over JMS_ further below on
this page for important notes about request/reply, as Camel offers a
number of options to configure for performance, and clustered
environments.
====

ThisÂ component allows messages to be sent to (or consumed from) a
http://java.sun.com/products/jms/[JMS] Queue or Topic. It uses Spring's
JMS support for declarative transactions, including Spring's
`JmsTemplate` for sending and a `MessageListenerContainer` for
consuming.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jms</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

--------------------------------------------
jms:[queue:|topic:]destinationName[?options]
--------------------------------------------

Where `destinationName` is a JMS queue or topic name. By default, the
`destinationName` is interpreted as a queue name. For example, to
connect to the queue, `FOO.BAR` use:

-----------
jms:FOO.BAR
-----------

You can include the optional `queue:` prefix, if you prefer:

-----------------
jms:queue:FOO.BAR
-----------------

To connect to a topic, you _must_ include the `topic:` prefix. For
example, to +
 connect to the topic, `Stocks.Prices`, use:

-----------------------
jms:topic:Stocks.Prices
-----------------------

You append query options to the URI using the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Notes

#### Using ActiveMQ

The JMS component reuses Spring 2's `JmsTemplate` for sending messages.
This is not ideal for use in a non-J2EE container and typically requires
some caching in the JMS provider to avoid
http://activemq.apache.org/jmstemplate-gotchas.html[poor performance].

If you intend to use http://activemq.apache.org/[Apache ActiveMQ] as
your Message Broker - which is a good choice as ActiveMQ rocks {icon-smile},
then we recommend that you either:

* Use the link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] component, which is already
optimized to use ActiveMQ efficiently
* Use the `PoolingConnectionFactory` in ActiveMQ.

#### Transactions and Cache Levels

If you are consuming messages and using transactions
(`transacted=true`) then the default settings for cache level can impact
performance.

If you are using XA transactions then you cannot cache as it can cause
the XA transaction to not work properly.

If you are *not* using XA, then you should consider caching as it speeds
up performance, such as setting `cacheLevelName=CACHE_CONSUMER`.

Through Camel 2.7.x, the default setting for `cacheLevelName` is
`CACHE_CONSUMER`. You will need to explicitly set
`cacheLevelName=CACHE_NONE`.

In Camel 2.8 onwards, the default setting for `cacheLevelName` is
`CACHE_AUTO`. This default auto detects the mode and sets the cache
level accordingly to:

* `CACHE_CONSUMER` if `transacted=false`
* `CACHE_NONE` if `transacted=true`

So you can say the default setting is conservative. Consider using
`cacheLevelName=CACHE_CONSUMER` if you are using non-XA transactions.

#### Durable Subscriptions

If you wish to use durable topic subscriptions, you need to specify both
`clientId` and `durableSubscriptionName`. The value of the `clientId`
must be unique and can only be used by a single JMS connection instance
in your entire network. You may prefer to use
http://activemq.apache.org/virtual-destinations.html[Virtual Topics]
instead to avoid this limitation. More background on durable messaging
http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-durable-queues-and-topics-work.html[here].

#### Message Header Mapping

When using message headers, the JMS specification states that header
names must be valid Java identifiers. So try to name your headers to be
valid Java identifiers. One benefit of doing this is that you can then
use your headers inside a JMS Selector (whose SQL92 syntax mandates Java
identifier syntax for headers).

A simple strategy for mapping header names is used by default. The
strategy is to replace any dots and hyphens in the header name as shown
below and to reverse the replacement when the header name is restored
from a JMS message sent over the wire. What does this mean? No more
losing method names to invoke on a bean component, no more losing the
filename header for the File Component, and so on.

The current header name strategy for accepting header names in Camel is
as follows:

* Dots are replaced by `_DOT_` and the replacement is reversed when
Camel consume the message
* Hyphen is replaced by `_HYPHEN_` and the replacement is reversed when
Camel consumes the message

### Options

You can configure many different properties on the JMS endpoint which
map to properties on the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-jms/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/jms/JmsConfiguration.html[JMSConfiguration
POJO].

[WARNING]
====
*Mapping to Spring JMS*

Many of these properties map to properties on Spring JMS, which Camel
uses for sending and receiving messages. So you can get more information
about these properties by consulting the relevant Spring documentation.

#### Component options








// component options: START
The JMS component supports 74 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| configuration | advanced |  | JmsConfiguration | To use a shared JMS configuration
| acceptMessagesWhileStopping | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Specifies whether the consumer accept messages while it is stopping. You may consider enabling this option if you start and stop JMS routes at runtime while there are still messages enqueued on the queue. If this option is false and you stop the JMS route then messages may be rejected and the JMS broker would have to attempt redeliveries which yet again may be rejected and eventually the message may be moved at a dead letter queue on the JMS broker. To avoid this its recommended to enable this option.
| allowReplyManagerQuickStop | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Whether the DefaultMessageListenerContainer used in the reply managers for request-reply messaging allow the DefaultMessageListenerContainer.runningAllowed flag to quick stop in case JmsConfigurationisAcceptMessagesWhileStopping is enabled and org.apache.camel.CamelContext is currently being stopped. This quick stop ability is enabled by default in the regular JMS consumers but to enable for reply managers you must enable this flag.
| acknowledgementMode | consumer |  | int | The JMS acknowledgement mode defined as an Integer. Allows you to set vendor-specific extensions to the acknowledgment mode. For the regular modes it is preferable to use the acknowledgementModeName instead.
| eagerLoadingOfProperties | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Enables eager loading of JMS properties as soon as a message is loaded which generally is inefficient as the JMS properties may not be required but sometimes can catch early any issues with the underlying JMS provider and the use of JMS properties
| acknowledgementModeName | consumer | AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE | String | The JMS acknowledgement name which is one of: SESSION_TRANSACTED CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE
| autoStartup | consumer | true | boolean | Specifies whether the consumer container should auto-startup.
| cacheLevel | consumer |  | int | Sets the cache level by ID for the underlying JMS resources. See cacheLevelName option for more details.
| cacheLevelName | consumer | CACHE_AUTO | String | Sets the cache level by name for the underlying JMS resources. Possible values are: CACHE_AUTO CACHE_CONNECTION CACHE_CONSUMER CACHE_NONE and CACHE_SESSION. The default setting is CACHE_AUTO. See the Spring documentation and Transactions Cache Levels for more information.
| replyToCacheLevelName | producer (advanced) |  | String | Sets the cache level by name for the reply consumer when doing request/reply over JMS. This option only applies when using fixed reply queues (not temporary). Camel will by default use: CACHE_CONSUMER for exclusive or shared w/ replyToSelectorName. And CACHE_SESSION for shared without replyToSelectorName. Some JMS brokers such as IBM WebSphere may require to set the replyToCacheLevelName=CACHE_NONE to work. Note: If using temporary queues then CACHE_NONE is not allowed and you must use a higher value such as CACHE_CONSUMER or CACHE_SESSION.
| clientId | common |  | String | Sets the JMS client ID to use. Note that this value if specified must be unique and can only be used by a single JMS connection instance. It is typically only required for durable topic subscriptions. If using Apache ActiveMQ you may prefer to use Virtual Topics instead.
| concurrentConsumers | consumer | 1 | int | Specifies the default number of concurrent consumers when consuming from JMS (not for request/reply over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. When doing request/reply over JMS then the option replyToConcurrentConsumers is used to control number of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.
| replyToConcurrentConsumers | producer | 1 | int | Specifies the default number of concurrent consumers when doing request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads.
| connectionFactory | common |  | ConnectionFactory | The connection factory to be use. A connection factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint.
| username | security |  | String | Username to use with the ConnectionFactory. You can also configure username/password directly on the ConnectionFactory.
| password | security |  | String | Password to use with the ConnectionFactory. You can also configure username/password directly on the ConnectionFactory.
| deliveryPersistent | producer | true | boolean | Specifies whether persistent delivery is used by default.
| deliveryMode | producer |  | Integer | Specifies the delivery mode to be used. Possible values are Possibles values are those defined by javax.jms.DeliveryMode. NON_PERSISTENT = 1 and PERSISTENT = 2.
| durableSubscriptionName | common |  | String | The durable subscriber name for specifying durable topic subscriptions. The clientId option must be configured as well.
| exceptionListener | advanced |  | ExceptionListener | Specifies the JMS Exception Listener that is to be notified of any underlying JMS exceptions.
| errorHandler | advanced |  | ErrorHandler | Specifies a org.springframework.util.ErrorHandler to be invoked in case of any uncaught exceptions thrown while processing a Message. By default these exceptions will be logged at the WARN level if no errorHandler has been configured. You can configure logging level and whether stack traces should be logged using errorHandlerLoggingLevel and errorHandlerLogStackTrace options. This makes it much easier to configure than having to code a custom errorHandler.
| errorHandlerLoggingLevel | logging | WARN | LoggingLevel | Allows to configure the default errorHandler logging level for logging uncaught exceptions.
| errorHandlerLogStackTrace | logging | true | boolean | Allows to control whether stacktraces should be logged or not by the default errorHandler.
| explicitQosEnabled | producer | false | boolean | Set if the deliveryMode priority or timeToLive qualities of service should be used when sending messages. This option is based on Spring's JmsTemplate. The deliveryMode priority and timeToLive options are applied to the current endpoint. This contrasts with the preserveMessageQos option which operates at message granularity reading QoS properties exclusively from the Camel In message headers.
| exposeListenerSession | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Specifies whether the listener session should be exposed when consuming messages.
| idleTaskExecutionLimit | advanced | 1 | int | Specifies the limit for idle executions of a receive task not having received any message within its execution. If this limit is reached the task will shut down and leave receiving to other executing tasks (in the case of dynamic scheduling; see the maxConcurrentConsumers setting). There is additional doc available from Spring.
| idleConsumerLimit | advanced | 1 | int | Specify the limit for the number of consumers that are allowed to be idle at any given time.
| maxConcurrentConsumers | consumer |  | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when consuming from JMS (not for request/reply over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. When doing request/reply over JMS then the option replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers is used to control number of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.
| replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers | producer |  | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when using request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads.
| replyOnTimeoutToMaxConcurrentConsumers | producer | 1 | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers for continue routing when timeout occurred when using request/reply over JMS.
| maxMessagesPerTask | advanced | -1 | int | The number of messages per task. -1 is unlimited. If you use a range for concurrent consumers (eg min max) then this option can be used to set a value to eg 100 to control how fast the consumers will shrink when less work is required.
| messageConverter | advanced |  | MessageConverter | To use a custom Spring org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter so you can be in control how to map to/from a javax.jms.Message.
| mapJmsMessage | advanced | true | boolean | Specifies whether Camel should auto map the received JMS message to a suited payload type such as javax.jms.TextMessage to a String etc. See section about how mapping works below for more details.
| messageIdEnabled | advanced | true | boolean | When sending specifies whether message IDs should be added. This is just an hint to the JMS Broker. If the JMS provider accepts this hint these messages must have the message ID set to null; if the provider ignores the hint the message ID must be set to its normal unique value
| messageTimestampEnabled | advanced | true | boolean | Specifies whether timestamps should be enabled by default on sending messages.
| alwaysCopyMessage | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | If true Camel will always make a JMS message copy of the message when it is passed to the producer for sending. Copying the message is needed in some situations such as when a replyToDestinationSelectorName is set (incidentally Camel will set the alwaysCopyMessage option to true if a replyToDestinationSelectorName is set)
| useMessageIDAsCorrelationID | advanced | false | boolean | Specifies whether JMSMessageID should always be used as JMSCorrelationID for InOut messages.
| priority | producer | 4 | int | Values greater than 1 specify the message priority when sending (where 0 is the lowest priority and 9 is the highest). The explicitQosEnabled option must also be enabled in order for this option to have any effect.
| pubSubNoLocal | advanced | false | boolean | Specifies whether to inhibit the delivery of messages published by its own connection.
| receiveTimeout | advanced | 1000 | long | The timeout for receiving messages (in milliseconds).
| recoveryInterval | advanced | 5000 | long | Specifies the interval between recovery attempts i.e. when a connection is being refreshed in milliseconds. The default is 5000 ms that is 5 seconds.
| subscriptionDurable | common | false | boolean | Deprecated: Enabled by default if you specify a durableSubscriptionName and a clientId.
| taskExecutor | consumer (advanced) |  | TaskExecutor | Allows you to specify a custom task executor for consuming messages.
| timeToLive | producer | -1 | long | When sending messages specifies the time-to-live of the message (in milliseconds).
| transacted | transaction | false | boolean | Specifies whether to use transacted mode
| lazyCreateTransactionManager | transaction (advanced) | true | boolean | If true Camel will create a JmsTransactionManager if there is no transactionManager injected when option transacted=true.
| transactionManager | transaction (advanced) |  | PlatformTransactionManager | The Spring transaction manager to use.
| transactionName | transaction (advanced) |  | String | The name of the transaction to use.
| transactionTimeout | transaction (advanced) | -1 | int | The timeout value of the transaction (in seconds) if using transacted mode.
| testConnectionOnStartup | common | false | boolean | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup. This ensures that when Camel starts that all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. If a connection cannot be granted then Camel throws an exception on startup. This ensures that Camel is not started with failed connections. The JMS producers is tested as well.
| asyncStartListener | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to startup the JmsConsumer message listener asynchronously when starting a route. For example if a JmsConsumer cannot get a connection to a remote JMS broker then it may block while retrying and/or failover. This will cause Camel to block while starting routes. By setting this option to true you will let routes startup while the JmsConsumer connects to the JMS broker using a dedicated thread in asynchronous mode. If this option is used then beware that if the connection could not be established then an exception is logged at WARN level and the consumer will not be able to receive messages; You can then restart the route to retry.
| asyncStopListener | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to stop the JmsConsumer message listener asynchronously when stopping a route.
| forceSendOriginalMessage | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | When using mapJmsMessage=false Camel will create a new JMS message to send to a new JMS destination if you touch the headers (get or set) during the route. Set this option to true to force Camel to send the original JMS message that was received.
| requestTimeout | producer | 20000 | long | The timeout for waiting for a reply when using the InOut Exchange Pattern (in milliseconds). The default is 20 seconds. You can include the header CamelJmsRequestTimeout to override this endpoint configured timeout value and thus have per message individual timeout values. See also the requestTimeoutCheckerInterval option.
| requestTimeoutCheckerInterval | advanced | 1000 | long | Configures how often Camel should check for timed out Exchanges when doing request/reply over JMS. By default Camel checks once per second. But if you must react faster when a timeout occurs then you can lower this interval to check more frequently. The timeout is determined by the option requestTimeout.
| transferExchange | advanced | false | boolean | You can transfer the exchange over the wire instead of just the body and headers. The following fields are transferred: In body Out body Fault body In headers Out headers Fault headers exchange properties exchange exception. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. You must enable this option on both the producer and consumer side so Camel knows the payloads is an Exchange and not a regular payload.
| transferException | advanced | false | boolean | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging (InOut) and an Exchange failed on the consumer side then the caused Exception will be send back in response as a javax.jms.ObjectMessage. If the client is Camel the returned Exception is rethrown. This allows you to use Camel JMS as a bridge in your routing - for example using persistent queues to enable robust routing. Notice that if you also have transferExchange enabled this option takes precedence. The caught exception is required to be serializable. The original Exception on the consumer side can be wrapped in an outer exception such as org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException when returned to the producer.
| transferFault | advanced | false | boolean | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging (InOut) and an Exchange failed with a SOAP fault (not exception) on the consumer side then the fault flag on link org.apache.camel.MessageisFault() will be send back in the response as a JMS header with the key link JmsConstantsJMS_TRANSFER_FAULT. If the client is Camel the returned fault flag will be set on the link org.apache.camel.MessagesetFault(boolean). You may want to enable this when using Camel components that support faults such as SOAP based such as cxf or spring-ws.
| jmsOperations | advanced |  | JmsOperations | Allows you to use your own implementation of the org.springframework.jms.core.JmsOperations interface. Camel uses JmsTemplate as default. Can be used for testing purpose but not used much as stated in the spring API docs.
| destinationResolver | advanced |  | DestinationResolver | A pluggable org.springframework.jms.support.destination.DestinationResolver that allows you to use your own resolver (for example to lookup the real destination in a JNDI registry).
| replyToType | producer |  | ReplyToType | Allows for explicitly specifying which kind of strategy to use for replyTo queues when doing request/reply over JMS. Possible values are: Temporary Shared or Exclusive. By default Camel will use temporary queues. However if replyTo has been configured then Shared is used by default. This option allows you to use exclusive queues instead of shared ones. See Camel JMS documentation for more details and especially the notes about the implications if running in a clustered environment and the fact that Shared reply queues has lower performance than its alternatives Temporary and Exclusive.
| preserveMessageQos | producer | false | boolean | Set to true if you want to send message using the QoS settings specified on the message instead of the QoS settings on the JMS endpoint. The following three headers are considered JMSPriority JMSDeliveryMode and JMSExpiration. You can provide all or only some of them. If not provided Camel will fall back to use the values from the endpoint instead. So when using this option the headers override the values from the endpoint. The explicitQosEnabled option by contrast will only use options set on the endpoint and not values from the message header.
| asyncConsumer | consumer | false | boolean | Whether the JmsConsumer processes the Exchange asynchronously. If enabled then the JmsConsumer may pickup the next message from the JMS queue while the previous message is being processed asynchronously (by the Asynchronous Routing Engine). This means that messages may be processed not 100 strictly in order. If disabled (as default) then the Exchange is fully processed before the JmsConsumer will pickup the next message from the JMS queue. Note if transacted has been enabled then asyncConsumer=true does not run asynchronously as transaction must be executed synchronously (Camel 3.0 may support async transactions).
| allowNullBody | producer (advanced) | true | boolean | Whether to allow sending messages with no body. If this option is false and the message body is null then an JMSException is thrown.
| includeSentJMSMessageID | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | Only applicable when sending to JMS destination using InOnly (eg fire and forget). Enabling this option will enrich the Camel Exchange with the actual JMSMessageID that was used by the JMS client when the message was sent to the JMS destination.
| includeAllJMSXProperties | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to include all JMSXxxx properties when mapping from JMS to Camel Message. Setting this to true will include properties such as JMSXAppID and JMSXUserID etc. Note: If you are using a custom headerFilterStrategy then this option does not apply.
| defaultTaskExecutorType | consumer (advanced) |  | DefaultTaskExecutorType | Specifies what default TaskExecutor type to use in the DefaultMessageListenerContainer for both consumer endpoints and the ReplyTo consumer of producer endpoints. Possible values: SimpleAsync (uses Spring's SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor) or ThreadPool (uses Spring's ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with optimal values - cached threadpool-like). If not set it defaults to the previous behaviour which uses a cached thread pool for consumer endpoints and SimpleAsync for reply consumers. The use of ThreadPool is recommended to reduce thread trash in elastic configurations with dynamically increasing and decreasing concurrent consumers.
| jmsKeyFormatStrategy | advanced |  | JmsKeyFormatStrategy | Pluggable strategy for encoding and decoding JMS keys so they can be compliant with the JMS specification. Camel provides two implementations out of the box: default and passthrough. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens (. and -). The passthrough strategy leaves the key as is. Can be used for JMS brokers which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters. You can provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy and refer to it using the notation.
| applicationContext | common |  | ApplicationContext | Sets the Spring ApplicationContext to use
| queueBrowseStrategy | advanced |  | QueueBrowseStrategy | To use a custom QueueBrowseStrategy when browsing queues
| messageCreatedStrategy | advanced |  | MessageCreatedStrategy | To use the given MessageCreatedStrategy which are invoked when Camel creates new instances of javax.jms.Message objects when Camel is sending a JMS message.
| waitForProvisionCorrelationToBeUpdatedCounter | advanced | 50 | int | Number of times to wait for provisional correlation id to be updated to the actual correlation id when doing request/reply over JMS and when the option useMessageIDAsCorrelationID is enabled.
| waitForProvisionCorrelationToBeUpdatedThreadSleepingTime | advanced | 100 | long | Interval in millis to sleep each time while waiting for provisional correlation id to be updated.
| headerFilterStrategy | filter |  | HeaderFilterStrategy | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message.

#### Endpoint options









// endpoint options: START
The JMS component supports 86 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| destinationType | common | queue | String | The kind of destination to use
| destinationName | common |  | String | *Required* Name of the queue or topic to use as destination
| clientId | common |  | String | Sets the JMS client ID to use. Note that this value if specified must be unique and can only be used by a single JMS connection instance. It is typically only required for durable topic subscriptions. If using Apache ActiveMQ you may prefer to use Virtual Topics instead.
| connectionFactory | common |  | ConnectionFactory | Sets the default connection factory to be used if a connection factory is not specified for either link setTemplateConnectionFactory(ConnectionFactory) or link setListenerConnectionFactory(ConnectionFactory)
| disableReplyTo | common | false | boolean | If true a producer will behave like a InOnly exchange with the exception that JMSReplyTo header is sent out and not be suppressed like in the case of InOnly. Like InOnly the producer will not wait for a reply. A consumer with this flag will behave like InOnly. This feature can be used to bridge InOut requests to another queue so that a route on the other queue will send its response directly back to the original JMSReplyTo.
| durableSubscriptionName | common |  | String | The durable subscriber name for specifying durable topic subscriptions. The clientId option must be configured as well.
| jmsMessageType | common |  | JmsMessageType | Allows you to force the use of a specific javax.jms.Message implementation for sending JMS messages. Possible values are: Bytes Map Object Stream Text. By default Camel would determine which JMS message type to use from the In body type. This option allows you to specify it.
| testConnectionOnStartup | common | false | boolean | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup. This ensures that when Camel starts that all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. If a connection cannot be granted then Camel throws an exception on startup. This ensures that Camel is not started with failed connections. The JMS producers is tested as well.
| acknowledgementModeName | consumer | AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE | String | The JMS acknowledgement name which is one of: SESSION_TRANSACTED CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE
| asyncConsumer | consumer | false | boolean | Whether the JmsConsumer processes the Exchange asynchronously. If enabled then the JmsConsumer may pickup the next message from the JMS queue while the previous message is being processed asynchronously (by the Asynchronous Routing Engine). This means that messages may be processed not 100 strictly in order. If disabled (as default) then the Exchange is fully processed before the JmsConsumer will pickup the next message from the JMS queue. Note if transacted has been enabled then asyncConsumer=true does not run asynchronously as transaction must be executed synchronously (Camel 3.0 may support async transactions).
| autoStartup | consumer | true | boolean | Specifies whether the consumer container should auto-startup.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| cacheLevel | consumer |  | int | Sets the cache level by ID for the underlying JMS resources. See cacheLevelName option for more details.
| cacheLevelName | consumer | CACHE_AUTO | String | Sets the cache level by name for the underlying JMS resources. Possible values are: CACHE_AUTO CACHE_CONNECTION CACHE_CONSUMER CACHE_NONE and CACHE_SESSION. The default setting is CACHE_AUTO. See the Spring documentation and Transactions Cache Levels for more information.
| concurrentConsumers | consumer | 1 | int | Specifies the default number of concurrent consumers when consuming from JMS (not for request/reply over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. When doing request/reply over JMS then the option replyToConcurrentConsumers is used to control number of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.
| maxConcurrentConsumers | consumer |  | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when consuming from JMS (not for request/reply over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. When doing request/reply over JMS then the option replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers is used to control number of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.
| replyTo | consumer |  | String | Provides an explicit ReplyTo destination which overrides any incoming value of Message.getJMSReplyTo().
| replyToDeliveryPersistent | consumer | true | boolean | Specifies whether to use persistent delivery by default for replies.
| selector | consumer |  | String | Sets the JMS selector to use
| acceptMessagesWhileStopping | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Specifies whether the consumer accept messages while it is stopping. You may consider enabling this option if you start and stop JMS routes at runtime while there are still messages enqueued on the queue. If this option is false and you stop the JMS route then messages may be rejected and the JMS broker would have to attempt redeliveries which yet again may be rejected and eventually the message may be moved at a dead letter queue on the JMS broker. To avoid this its recommended to enable this option.
| allowReplyManagerQuickStop | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Whether the DefaultMessageListenerContainer used in the reply managers for request-reply messaging allow the link DefaultMessageListenerContainerrunningAllowed() flag to quick stop in case link JmsConfigurationisAcceptMessagesWhileStopping() is enabled and org.apache.camel.CamelContext is currently being stopped. This quick stop ability is enabled by default in the regular JMS consumers but to enable for reply managers you must enable this flag.
| consumerType | consumer (advanced) | Default | ConsumerType | The consumer type to use which can be one of: Simple Default or Custom. The consumer type determines which Spring JMS listener to use. Default will use org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer Simple will use org.springframework.jms.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer. When Custom is specified the MessageListenerContainerFactory defined by the messageListenerContainerFactory option will determine what org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer to use.
| defaultTaskExecutorType | consumer (advanced) |  | DefaultTaskExecutorType | Specifies what default TaskExecutor type to use in the DefaultMessageListenerContainer for both consumer endpoints and the ReplyTo consumer of producer endpoints. Possible values: SimpleAsync (uses Spring's SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor) or ThreadPool (uses Spring's ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with optimal values - cached threadpool-like). If not set it defaults to the previous behaviour which uses a cached thread pool for consumer endpoints and SimpleAsync for reply consumers. The use of ThreadPool is recommended to reduce thread trash in elastic configurations with dynamically increasing and decreasing concurrent consumers.
| eagerLoadingOfProperties | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Enables eager loading of JMS properties as soon as a message is loaded which generally is inefficient as the JMS properties may not be required but sometimes can catch early any issues with the underlying JMS provider and the use of JMS properties
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.
| exposeListenerSession | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Specifies whether the listener session should be exposed when consuming messages.
| replyToSameDestinationAllowed | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Whether a JMS consumer is allowed to send a reply message to the same destination that the consumer is using to consume from. This prevents an endless loop by consuming and sending back the same message to itself.
| taskExecutor | consumer (advanced) |  | TaskExecutor | Allows you to specify a custom task executor for consuming messages.
| deliveryMode | producer |  | Integer | Specifies the delivery mode to be used. Possibles values are those defined by javax.jms.DeliveryMode. NON_PERSISTENT = 1 and PERSISTENT = 2.
| deliveryPersistent | producer | true | boolean | Specifies whether persistent delivery is used by default.
| explicitQosEnabled | producer | false | Boolean | Set if the deliveryMode priority or timeToLive qualities of service should be used when sending messages. This option is based on Spring's JmsTemplate. The deliveryMode priority and timeToLive options are applied to the current endpoint. This contrasts with the preserveMessageQos option which operates at message granularity reading QoS properties exclusively from the Camel In message headers.
| preserveMessageQos | producer | false | boolean | Set to true if you want to send message using the QoS settings specified on the message instead of the QoS settings on the JMS endpoint. The following three headers are considered JMSPriority JMSDeliveryMode and JMSExpiration. You can provide all or only some of them. If not provided Camel will fall back to use the values from the endpoint instead. So when using this option the headers override the values from the endpoint. The explicitQosEnabled option by contrast will only use options set on the endpoint and not values from the message header.
| priority | producer | 4 | int | Values greater than 1 specify the message priority when sending (where 0 is the lowest priority and 9 is the highest). The explicitQosEnabled option must also be enabled in order for this option to have any effect.
| replyToConcurrentConsumers | producer | 1 | int | Specifies the default number of concurrent consumers when doing request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads.
| replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers | producer |  | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when using request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads.
| replyToOnTimeoutMaxConcurrentConsumers | producer | 1 | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers for continue routing when timeout occurred when using request/reply over JMS.
| replyToOverride | producer |  | String | Provides an explicit ReplyTo destination in the JMS message which overrides the setting of replyTo. It is useful if you want to forward the message to a remote Queue and receive the reply message from the ReplyTo destination.
| replyToType | producer |  | ReplyToType | Allows for explicitly specifying which kind of strategy to use for replyTo queues when doing request/reply over JMS. Possible values are: Temporary Shared or Exclusive. By default Camel will use temporary queues. However if replyTo has been configured then Shared is used by default. This option allows you to use exclusive queues instead of shared ones. See Camel JMS documentation for more details and especially the notes about the implications if running in a clustered environment and the fact that Shared reply queues has lower performance than its alternatives Temporary and Exclusive.
| requestTimeout | producer | 20000 | long | The timeout for waiting for a reply when using the InOut Exchange Pattern (in milliseconds). The default is 20 seconds. You can include the header CamelJmsRequestTimeout to override this endpoint configured timeout value and thus have per message individual timeout values. See also the requestTimeoutCheckerInterval option.
| timeToLive | producer | -1 | long | When sending messages specifies the time-to-live of the message (in milliseconds).
| allowNullBody | producer (advanced) | true | boolean | Whether to allow sending messages with no body. If this option is false and the message body is null then an JMSException is thrown.
| alwaysCopyMessage | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | If true Camel will always make a JMS message copy of the message when it is passed to the producer for sending. Copying the message is needed in some situations such as when a replyToDestinationSelectorName is set (incidentally Camel will set the alwaysCopyMessage option to true if a replyToDestinationSelectorName is set)
| disableTimeToLive | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | Use this option to force disabling time to live. For example when you do request/reply over JMS then Camel will by default use the requestTimeout value as time to live on the message being sent. The problem is that the sender and receiver systems have to have their clocks synchronized so they are in sync. This is not always so easy to archive. So you can use disableTimeToLive=true to not set a time to live value on the sent message. Then the message will not expire on the receiver system. See below in section About time to live for more details.
| forceSendOriginalMessage | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | When using mapJmsMessage=false Camel will create a new JMS message to send to a new JMS destination if you touch the headers (get or set) during the route. Set this option to true to force Camel to send the original JMS message that was received.
| includeSentJMSMessageID | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | Only applicable when sending to JMS destination using InOnly (eg fire and forget). Enabling this option will enrich the Camel Exchange with the actual JMSMessageID that was used by the JMS client when the message was sent to the JMS destination.
| replyToCacheLevelName | producer (advanced) |  | String | Sets the cache level by name for the reply consumer when doing request/reply over JMS. This option only applies when using fixed reply queues (not temporary). Camel will by default use: CACHE_CONSUMER for exclusive or shared w/ replyToSelectorName. And CACHE_SESSION for shared without replyToSelectorName. Some JMS brokers such as IBM WebSphere may require to set the replyToCacheLevelName=CACHE_NONE to work. Note: If using temporary queues then CACHE_NONE is not allowed and you must use a higher value such as CACHE_CONSUMER or CACHE_SESSION.
| replyToDestinationSelectorName | producer (advanced) |  | String | Sets the JMS Selector using the fixed name to be used so you can filter out your own replies from the others when using a shared queue (that is if you are not using a temporary reply queue).
| allowSerializedHeaders | advanced | false | boolean | Controls whether or not to include serialized headers. Applies only when link isTransferExchange() is true. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level.
| asyncStartListener | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to startup the JmsConsumer message listener asynchronously when starting a route. For example if a JmsConsumer cannot get a connection to a remote JMS broker then it may block while retrying and/or failover. This will cause Camel to block while starting routes. By setting this option to true you will let routes startup while the JmsConsumer connects to the JMS broker using a dedicated thread in asynchronous mode. If this option is used then beware that if the connection could not be established then an exception is logged at WARN level and the consumer will not be able to receive messages; You can then restart the route to retry.
| asyncStopListener | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to stop the JmsConsumer message listener asynchronously when stopping a route.
| destinationResolver | advanced |  | DestinationResolver | A pluggable org.springframework.jms.support.destination.DestinationResolver that allows you to use your own resolver (for example to lookup the real destination in a JNDI registry).
| errorHandler | advanced |  | ErrorHandler | Specifies a org.springframework.util.ErrorHandler to be invoked in case of any uncaught exceptions thrown while processing a Message. By default these exceptions will be logged at the WARN level if no errorHandler has been configured. You can configure logging level and whether stack traces should be logged using errorHandlerLoggingLevel and errorHandlerLogStackTrace options. This makes it much easier to configure than having to code a custom errorHandler.
| exceptionListener | advanced |  | ExceptionListener | Specifies the JMS Exception Listener that is to be notified of any underlying JMS exceptions.
| headerFilterStrategy | advanced |  | HeaderFilterStrategy | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message.
| idleConsumerLimit | advanced | 1 | int | Specify the limit for the number of consumers that are allowed to be idle at any given time.
| idleTaskExecutionLimit | advanced | 1 | int | Specifies the limit for idle executions of a receive task not having received any message within its execution. If this limit is reached the task will shut down and leave receiving to other executing tasks (in the case of dynamic scheduling; see the maxConcurrentConsumers setting). There is additional doc available from Spring.
| includeAllJMSXProperties | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to include all JMSXxxx properties when mapping from JMS to Camel Message. Setting this to true will include properties such as JMSXAppID and JMSXUserID etc. Note: If you are using a custom headerFilterStrategy then this option does not apply.
| jmsKeyFormatStrategy | advanced |  | String | Pluggable strategy for encoding and decoding JMS keys so they can be compliant with the JMS specification. Camel provides two implementations out of the box: default and passthrough. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens (. and -). The passthrough strategy leaves the key as is. Can be used for JMS brokers which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters. You can provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy and refer to it using the notation.
| mapJmsMessage | advanced | true | boolean | Specifies whether Camel should auto map the received JMS message to a suited payload type such as javax.jms.TextMessage to a String etc.
| maxMessagesPerTask | advanced | -1 | int | The number of messages per task. -1 is unlimited. If you use a range for concurrent consumers (eg min max) then this option can be used to set a value to eg 100 to control how fast the consumers will shrink when less work is required.
| messageConverter | advanced |  | MessageConverter | To use a custom Spring org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter so you can be in control how to map to/from a javax.jms.Message.
| messageCreatedStrategy | advanced |  | MessageCreatedStrategy | To use the given MessageCreatedStrategy which are invoked when Camel creates new instances of javax.jms.Message objects when Camel is sending a JMS message.
| messageIdEnabled | advanced | true | boolean | When sending specifies whether message IDs should be added. This is just an hint to the JMS Broker. If the JMS provider accepts this hint these messages must have the message ID set to null; if the provider ignores the hint the message ID must be set to its normal unique value
| messageListenerContainerFactory | advanced |  | MessageListenerContainerFactory | Registry ID of the MessageListenerContainerFactory used to determine what org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer to use to consume messages. Setting this will automatically set consumerType to Custom.
| messageTimestampEnabled | advanced | true | boolean | Specifies whether timestamps should be enabled by default on sending messages. This is just an hint to the JMS Broker. If the JMS provider accepts this hint these messages must have the timestamp set to zero; if the provider ignores the hint the timestamp must be set to its normal value
| pubSubNoLocal | advanced | false | boolean | Specifies whether to inhibit the delivery of messages published by its own connection.
| receiveTimeout | advanced | 1000 | long | The timeout for receiving messages (in milliseconds).
| recoveryInterval | advanced | 5000 | long | Specifies the interval between recovery attempts i.e. when a connection is being refreshed in milliseconds. The default is 5000 ms that is 5 seconds.
| requestTimeoutCheckerInterval | advanced | 1000 | long | Configures how often Camel should check for timed out Exchanges when doing request/reply over JMS. By default Camel checks once per second. But if you must react faster when a timeout occurs then you can lower this interval to check more frequently. The timeout is determined by the option requestTimeout.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
| transferException | advanced | false | boolean | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging (InOut) and an Exchange failed on the consumer side then the caused Exception will be send back in response as a javax.jms.ObjectMessage. If the client is Camel the returned Exception is rethrown. This allows you to use Camel JMS as a bridge in your routing - for example using persistent queues to enable robust routing. Notice that if you also have transferExchange enabled this option takes precedence. The caught exception is required to be serializable. The original Exception on the consumer side can be wrapped in an outer exception such as org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException when returned to the producer.
| transferExchange | advanced | false | boolean | You can transfer the exchange over the wire instead of just the body and headers. The following fields are transferred: In body Out body Fault body In headers Out headers Fault headers exchange properties exchange exception. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. You must enable this option on both the producer and consumer side so Camel knows the payloads is an Exchange and not a regular payload.
| transferFault | advanced | false | boolean | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging (InOut) and an Exchange failed with a SOAP fault (not exception) on the consumer side then the fault flag on link org.apache.camel.MessageisFault() will be send back in the response as a JMS header with the key link JmsConstantsJMS_TRANSFER_FAULT. If the client is Camel the returned fault flag will be set on the link org.apache.camel.MessagesetFault(boolean). You may want to enable this when using Camel components that support faults such as SOAP based such as cxf or spring-ws.
| useMessageIDAsCorrelationID | advanced | false | boolean | Specifies whether JMSMessageID should always be used as JMSCorrelationID for InOut messages.
| waitForProvisionCorrelationToBeUpdatedCounter | advanced | 50 | int | Number of times to wait for provisional correlation id to be updated to the actual correlation id when doing request/reply over JMS and when the option useMessageIDAsCorrelationID is enabled.
| waitForProvisionCorrelationToBeUpdatedThreadSleepingTime | advanced | 100 | long | Interval in millis to sleep each time while waiting for provisional correlation id to be updated.
| errorHandlerLoggingLevel | logging | WARN | LoggingLevel | Allows to configure the default errorHandler logging level for logging uncaught exceptions.
| errorHandlerLogStackTrace | logging | true | boolean | Allows to control whether stacktraces should be logged or not by the default errorHandler.
| password | security |  | String | Password to use with the ConnectionFactory. You can also configure username/password directly on the ConnectionFactory.
| username | security |  | String | Username to use with the ConnectionFactory. You can also configure username/password directly on the ConnectionFactory.
| transacted | transaction | false | boolean | Specifies whether to use transacted mode
| lazyCreateTransactionManager | transaction (advanced) | true | boolean | If true Camel will create a JmsTransactionManager if there is no transactionManager injected when option transacted=true.
| transactionManager | transaction (advanced) |  | PlatformTransactionManager | The Spring transaction manager to use.
| transactionName | transaction (advanced) |  | String | The name of the transaction to use.
| transactionTimeout | transaction (advanced) | -1 | int | The timeout value of the transaction (in seconds) if using transacted mode.

### Message Mapping between JMS and Camel

Camel automatically maps messages between `javax.jms.Message` and
`org.apache.camel.Message`.

When sending a JMS message, Camel converts the message body to the
following JMS message types:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Body Type |JMS Message |Comment
|`String` |`javax.jms.TextMessage` |Â 

|`org.w3c.dom.Node` |`javax.jms.TextMessage` |The DOM will be converted
to `String`.

|`Map` |`javax.jms.MapMessage` |Â 

|`java.io.Serializable` |`javax.jms.ObjectMessage` |Â 

|`byte[]` |`javax.jms.BytesMessage` |Â 

|`java.io.File` |`javax.jms.BytesMessage` |Â 

|`java.io.Reader` |`javax.jms.BytesMessage` |Â 

|`java.io.InputStream` |`javax.jms.BytesMessage` |Â 

|`java.nio.ByteBuffer` |`javax.jms.BytesMessage` |Â 
|=======================================================================

When receiving a JMS message, Camel converts the JMS message to the
following body type:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=============================================
|JMS Message |Body Type
|`javax.jms.TextMessage` |`String`
|`javax.jms.BytesMessage` |`byte[]`
|`javax.jms.MapMessage` |`Map<String, Object>`
|`javax.jms.ObjectMessage` |`Object`
|=============================================

#### Disabling auto-mapping of JMS messages

You can use the `mapJmsMessage` option to disable the auto-mapping
above. If disabled, Camel will not try to map the received JMS message,
but instead uses it directly as the payload. This allows you to avoid
the overhead of mapping and let Camel just pass through the JMS message.
For instance, it even allows you to route `javax.jms.ObjectMessage` JMS
messages with classes you do *not* have on the classpath.

#### Using a custom MessageConverter

You can use the `messageConverter` option to do the mapping yourself in
a Spring `org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter`
class.

For example, in the route below we use a custom message converter when
sending a message to the JMS order queue:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("file://inbox/order").to("jms:queue:order?messageConverter=#myMessageConverter");
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use a custom message converter when consuming from a JMS
destination.

#### Controlling the mapping strategy selected

You can use the `jmsMessageType` option on the endpoint URL to force a
specific message type for all messages.

In the route below, we poll files from a folder and send them as
`javax.jms.TextMessage` as we have forced the JMS producer endpoint to
use text messages:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
from("file://inbox/order").to("jms:queue:order?jmsMessageType=Text");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also specify the message type to use for each message by setting
the header with the key `CamelJmsMessageType`. For example:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("file://inbox/order").setHeader("CamelJmsMessageType", JmsMessageType.Text).to("jms:queue:order");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The possible values are defined in the `enum` class,
`org.apache.camel.jms.JmsMessageType`.

### Message format when sending

The exchange that is sent over the JMS wire must conform to the
http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/jms/Message.html[JMS Message
spec].

For the `exchange.in.header` the following rules apply for the header
**keys**:

* Keys starting with `JMS` or `JMSX` are reserved.
* `exchange.in.headers` keys must be literals and all be valid Java
identifiers (do not use dots in the key name).
* Camel replaces dots & hyphens and the reverse when when consuming JMS
messages: +
 `.` is replaced by `_DOT_` and the reverse replacement when Camel
consumes the message. +
 `-` is replaced by `_HYPHEN_` and the reverse replacement when Camel
consumes the message.
* See also the option `jmsKeyFormatStrategy`, which allows use of your
own custom strategy for formatting keys.

For the `exchange.in.header`, the following rules apply for the header
**values**:

* The values must be primitives or their counter objects (such as
`Integer`, `Long`, `Character`). The types, `String`, `CharSequence`,
`Date`, `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` are all converted to their
`toString()` representation. All other types are dropped.

Camel will log with category `org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsBinding`
at *DEBUG* level if it drops a given header value. For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2008-07-09 06:43:04,046 [main           ] DEBUG JmsBinding
  - Ignoring non primitive header: order of class: org.apache.camel.component.jms.issues.DummyOrder with value: DummyOrder{orderId=333, itemId=4444, quantity=2}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Message format when receiving

Camel adds the following properties to the `Exchange` when it receives a
message:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Type |Description
|`org.apache.camel.jms.replyDestination` |`javax.jms.Destination` |The
reply destination.
|=======================================================================

Camel adds the following JMS properties to the In message headers when
it receives a JMS message:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description
|`JMSCorrelationID` |`String` |The JMS correlation ID.

|`JMSDeliveryMode` |`int` |The JMS delivery mode.

|`JMSDestination` |`javax.jms.Destination` |The JMS destination.

|`JMSExpiration` |`long` |The JMS expiration.

|`JMSMessageID` |`String` |The JMS unique message ID.

|`JMSPriority` |`int` |The JMS priority (with 0 as the lowest priority
and 9 as the highest).

|`JMSRedelivered` |`boolean` |Is the JMS message redelivered.

|`JMSReplyTo` |`javax.jms.Destination` |The JMS reply-to destination.

|`JMSTimestamp` |`long` |The JMS timestamp.

|`JMSType` |`String` |The JMS type.

|`JMSXGroupID` |`String` |The JMS group ID.
|=======================================================================

As all the above information is standard JMS you can check the
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/jms/Message.html[JMS
documentation] for further details.

### About using Camel to send and receive messages and JMSReplyTo

The JMS component is complex and you have to pay close attention to how
it works in some cases. So this is a short summary of some of the
areas/pitfalls to look for.

When Camel sends a message using its `JMSProducer`, it checks the
following conditions:

* The message exchange pattern,
* Whether a `JMSReplyTo` was set in the endpoint or in the message
headers,
* Whether any of the following options have been set on the JMS
endpoint: `disableReplyTo`, `preserveMessageQos`, `explicitQosEnabled`.

All this can be a tad complex to understand and configure to support
your use case.

#### JmsProducer

The `JmsProducer` behaves as follows, depending on configuration:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Exchange Pattern |Other options |Description
|_InOut_ |- |Camel will expect a reply, set a temporary `JMSReplyTo`,
and after sending the message, it will start to listen for the reply
message on the temporary queue.

|_InOut_ |`JMSReplyTo` is set |Camel will expect a reply and, after
sending the message, it will start to listen for the reply message on
the specified `JMSReplyTo` queue.

|_InOnly_ |- |Camel will send the message and *not* expect a reply.

|_InOnly_ |`JMSReplyTo` is set |By default, Camel discards the
`JMSReplyTo` destination and clears the `JMSReplyTo` header before
sending the message. Camel then sends the message and does *not* expect
a reply. Camel logs this in the log at `WARN` level (changed to `DEBUG`
level from *Camel 2.6* onwards. You can use `preserveMessageQuo=true` to
instruct Camel to keep the `JMSReplyTo`. In all situations the
`JmsProducer` does *not* expect any reply and thus continue after
sending the message.
|=======================================================================

#### JmsConsumer

The `JmsConsumer` behaves as follows, depending on configuration:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Exchange Pattern |Other options |Description
|_InOut_ |- |Camel will send the reply back to the `JMSReplyTo` queue.

|_InOnly_ |- |Camel will not send a reply back, as the pattern is
__InOnly__.

|- |`disableReplyTo=true` |This option suppresses replies.
|=======================================================================

So pay attention to the message exchange pattern set on your exchanges.

If you send a message to a JMS destination in the middle of your route
you can specify the exchange pattern to use, see more at
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply]. +
 This is useful if you want to send an `InOnly` message to a JMS topic:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------
from("activemq:queue:in")
   .to("bean:validateOrder")
   .to(ExchangePattern.InOnly, "activemq:topic:order")
   .to("bean:handleOrder");
------------------------------------------------------

### Reuse endpoint and send to different destinations computed at runtime

If you need to send messages to a lot of different JMS destinations, it
makes sense to reuse a JMS endpoint and specify the real destination in
a message header. This allows Camel to reuse the same endpoint, but send
to different destinations. This greatly reduces the number of endpoints
created and economizes on memory and thread resources.

You can specify the destination in the following headers:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=====================================================================
|Header |Type |Description
|`CamelJmsDestination` |`javax.jms.Destination` |A destination object.
|`CamelJmsDestinationName` |`String` |The destination name.
|=====================================================================

For example, the following route shows how you can compute a destination
at run time and use it to override the destination appearing in the JMS
URL:

[source,java]
--------------------------------
from("file://inbox")
  .to("bean:computeDestination")
  .to("activemq:queue:dummy");
--------------------------------

The queue name, `dummy`, is just a placeholder. It must be provided as
part of the JMS endpoint URL, but it will be ignored in this example.

In the `computeDestination` bean, specify the real destination by
setting the `CamelJmsDestinationName` header as follows:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
public void setJmsHeader(Exchange exchange) {
   String id = ....
   exchange.getIn().setHeader("CamelJmsDestinationName", "order:" + id");
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then Camel will read this header and use it as the destination instead
of the one configured on the endpoint. So, in this example Camel sends
the message to `activemq:queue:order:2`, assuming the `id` value was 2.

If both the `CamelJmsDestination` and the `CamelJmsDestinationName`
headers are set, `CamelJmsDestination` takes priority. Keep in mind that
the JMS producer removes both `CamelJmsDestination` and
`CamelJmsDestinationName` headers from the exchange and do not propagate
them to the created JMS messageÂ in order to avoid the accidental loops
in the routes (in scenarios when the message will be forwarded to the
another JMS endpoint).

### Configuring different JMS providers

You can configure your JMS provider in link:spring.html[Spring] XML as
follows:

Basically, you can configure as many JMS component instances as you wish
and give them *a unique name using the* `id` **attribute**. The
preceding example configures an `activemq` component. You could do the
same to configure MQSeries, TibCo, BEA, Sonic and so on.

Once you have a named JMS component, you can then refer to endpoints
within that component using URIs. For example for the component name,
`activemq`, you can then refer to destinations using the URI format,
`activemq:[queue:|topic:]destinationName`. You can use the same approach
for all other JMS providers.

This works by the SpringCamelContext lazily fetching components from the
spring context for the scheme name you use for
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] link:uris.html[URIs] and having the
link:component.html[Component] resolve the endpoint URIs.

#### Using JNDI to find the ConnectionFactory

If you are using a J2EE container, you might need to look up JNDI to
find the JMS `ConnectionFactory` rather than use the usual `<bean>`
mechanism in Spring. You can do this using Spring's factory bean or the
new Spring XML namespace. For example:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="weblogic" class="org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsComponent">
  <property name="connectionFactory" ref="myConnectionFactory"/>
</bean>

<jee:jndi-lookup id="myConnectionFactory" jndi-name="jms/connectionFactory"/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

See
http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/xsd-config.html#xsd-config-body-schemas-jee[The
jee schema] in the Spring reference documentation for more details about
JNDI lookup.

### Concurrent Consuming

A common requirement with JMS is to consume messages concurrently in
multiple threads in order to make an application more responsive. You
can set the `concurrentConsumers` option to specify the number of
threads servicing the JMS endpoint, as follows:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------
from("jms:SomeQueue?concurrentConsumers=20").
  bean(MyClass.class);
---------------------------------------------

You can configure this option in one of the following ways:

* On the `JmsComponent`,
* On the endpoint URI or,
* By invoking `setConcurrentConsumers()` directly on the `JmsEndpoint`.

#### Concurrent Consuming with async consumer

Notice that each concurrent consumer will only pickup the next available
message from the JMS broker, when the current message has been fully
processed. You can set the option `asyncConsumer=true` to let the
consumer pickup the next message from the JMS queue, while the previous
message is being processed asynchronously (by the
link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous Routing Engine]). See
more details in the table on top of the page about the `asyncConsumer`
option.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------
from("jms:SomeQueue?concurrentConsumers=20&asyncConsumer=true").
  bean(MyClass.class);
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Request-reply over JMS

Camel supports link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] over JMS. In
essence the MEP of the Exchange should be `InOut` when you send a
message to a JMS queue.

Camel offers a number of options to configure request/reply over JMS
that influence performance and clustered environments. The table below
summaries the options.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Performance |Cluster |Description
|`Temporary` |Fast |Yes |A temporary queue is used as reply queue, and
automatic created by Camel. To use this do *not* specify a replyTo queue
name. And you can optionally configure `replyToType=Temporary` to make
it stand out that temporary queues are in use.

|`Shared` |Slow |Yes |A shared persistent queue is used as reply queue.
The queue must be created beforehand, although some brokers can create
them on the fly such as Apache ActiveMQ. To use this you must specify
the replyTo queue name. And you can optionally configure
`replyToType=Shared` to make it stand out that shared queues are in use.
A shared queue can be used in a clustered environment with multiple
nodes running this Camel application at the same time. All using the
same shared reply queue. This is possible because JMS Message selectors
are used to correlate expected reply messages; this impacts performance
though. JMS Message selectors is slower, and therefore not as fast as
`Temporary` or `Exclusive` queues. See further below how to tweak this
for better performance.

|`Exclusive` |Fast |No (*Yes) |An exclusive persistent queue is used as
reply queue. The queue must be created beforehand, although some brokers
can create them on the fly such as Apache ActiveMQ. To use this you must
specify the replyTo queue name. And you *must* configure
`replyToType=Exclusive` to instruct Camel to use exclusive queues, as
`Shared` is used by default, if a `replyTo` queue name was configured.
When using exclusive reply queues, then JMS Message selectors are *not*
in use, and therefore other applications must not use this queue as
well. An exclusive queue *cannot* be used in a clustered environment
with multiple nodes running this Camel application at the same time; as
we do not have control if the reply queue comes back to the same node
that sent the request message; that is why shared queues use JMS Message
selectors to make sure of this. *Though* if you configure each Exclusive
reply queue with an unique name per node, then you can run this in a
clustered environment. As then the reply message will be sent back to
that queue for the given node, that awaits the reply message.

|`concurrentConsumers` |Fast |Yes |*Camel 2.10.3:* Allows to process
reply messages concurrently using concurrent message listeners in use.
You can specify a range using the `concurrentConsumers` and
`maxConcurrentConsumers` options. *Notice:* That using `Shared` reply
queues may not work as well with concurrent listeners, so use this
option with care.

|`maxConcurrentConsumers` |Fast |Yes |*Camel 2.10.3:* Allows to process
reply messages concurrently using concurrent message listeners in use.
You can specify a range using the `concurrentConsumers` and
`maxConcurrentConsumers` options. *Notice:* That using `Shared` reply
queues may not work as well with concurrent listeners, so use this
option with care.
|=======================================================================

The `JmsProducer` detects the `InOut` and provides a `JMSReplyTo` header
with the reply destination to be used. By default Camel uses a temporary
queue, but you can use the `replyTo` option on the endpoint to specify a
fixed reply queue (see more below about fixed reply queue).

Camel will automatic setup a consumer which listen on the reply queue,
so you should *not* do anything. +
 This consumer is a Spring `DefaultMessageListenerContainer` which
listen for replies. However it's fixed to 1 concurrent consumer. +
 That means replies will be processed in sequence as there are only 1
thread to process the replies. If you want to process replies faster,
then we need to use concurrency. But *not* using the
`concurrentConsumer` option. We should use the `threads` from the Camel
DSL instead, as shown in the route below:

Instead of using threads, then use concurrentConsumers option if using
Camel 2.10.3 or better. See further below.

[source,java]
---------------------------------
from(xxx)
.inOut().to("activemq:queue:foo")
.threads(5)
.to(yyy)
.to(zzz);
---------------------------------

In this route we instruct Camel to route replies
link:async.html[asynchronously] using a thread pool with 5 threads.

From *Camel 2.10.3* onwards you can now configure the listener to use
concurrent threads using the `concurrentConsumers` and
`maxConcurrentConsumers` options. This allows you to easier configure
this in Camel as shown below:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
from(xxx)
.inOut().to("activemq:queue:foo?concurrentConsumers=5")
.to(yyy)
.to(zzz);
-------------------------------------------------------

#### Request-reply over JMS and using a shared fixed reply queue

If you use a fixed reply queue when doing
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] over JMS as shown in the example
below, then pay attention.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------
from(xxx)
.inOut().to("activemq:queue:foo?replyTo=bar")
.to(yyy)
---------------------------------------------

In this example the fixed reply queue named "bar" is used. By default
Camel assumes the queue is shared when using fixed reply queues, and
therefore it uses a `JMSSelector` to only pickup the expected reply
messages (eg based on the `JMSCorrelationID`). See next section for
exclusive fixed reply queues. That means its not as fast as temporary
queues. You can speedup how often Camel will pull for reply messages
using the `receiveTimeout` option. By default its 1000 millis. So to
make it faster you can set it to 250 millis to pull 4 times per second
as shown:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------
from(xxx)
.inOut().to("activemq:queue:foo?replyTo=bar&receiveTimeout=250")
.to(yyy)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Notice this will cause the Camel to send pull requests to the message
broker more frequent, and thus require more network traffic. +
 It is generally recommended to use temporary queues if possible.

#### Request-reply over JMS and using an exclusive fixed reply queue

*Available as of Camel 2.9*

In the previous example, Camel would anticipate the fixed reply queue
named "bar" was shared, and thus it uses a `JMSSelector` to only consume
reply messages which it expects. However there is a drawback doing this
as JMS selectos is slower. Also the consumer on the reply queue is
slower to update with new JMS selector ids. In fact it only updates when
the `receiveTimeout` option times out, which by default is 1 second. So
in theory the reply messages could take up till about 1 sec to be
detected. On the other hand if the fixed reply queue is exclusive to the
Camel reply consumer, then we can avoid using the JMS selectors, and
thus be more performant. In fact as fast as using temporary queues. So
in *Camel 2.9* onwards we introduced the `ReplyToType` option which you
can configure to `Exclusive` +
 to tell Camel that the reply queue is exclusive as shown in the example
below:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
from(xxx)
.inOut().to("activemq:queue:foo?replyTo=bar&replyToType=Exclusive")
.to(yyy)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mind that the queue must be exclusive to each and every endpoint. So if
you have two routes, then they each need an unique reply queue as shown
in the next example:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
from(xxx)
.inOut().to("activemq:queue:foo?replyTo=bar&replyToType=Exclusive")
.to(yyy)

from(aaa)
.inOut().to("activemq:queue:order?replyTo=order.reply&replyToType=Exclusive")
.to(bbb)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same applies if you run in a clustered environment. Then each node
in the cluster must use an unique reply queue name. As otherwise each
node in the cluster may pickup messages which was intended as a reply on
another node. For clustered environments its recommended to use shared
reply queues instead.

### Synchronizing clocks between senders and receivers

When doing messaging between systems, its desirable that the systems
have synchronized clocks. For example when sending a link:jms.html[JMS]
message, then you can set a time to live value on the message. Then the
receiver can inspect this value, and determine if the message is already
expired, and thus drop the message instead of consume and process it.
However this requires that both sender and receiver have synchronized
clocks. If you are using http://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ] then you
can use the http://activemq.apache.org/timestampplugin.html[timestamp
plugin] to synchronize clocks.

### About time to live

Read first above about synchronized clocks.

When you do request/reply (InOut) over link:jms.html[JMS] with Camel
then Camel uses a timeout on the sender side, which is default 20
seconds from the `requestTimeout` option. You can control this by
setting a higher/lower value. However the time to live value is still
set on the link:jms.html[JMS] message being send. So that requires the
clocks to be synchronized between the systems. If they are not, then you
may want to disable the time to live value being set. This is now
possible using the `disableTimeToLive` option from *Camel 2.8* onwards.
So if you set this option to `disableTimeToLive=true`, then Camel does
*not* set any time to live value when sending link:jms.html[JMS]
messages. *But* the request timeout is still active. So for example if
you do request/reply over link:jms.html[JMS] and have disabled time to
live, then Camel will still use a timeout by 20 seconds (the
`requestTimeout` option). That option can of course also be configured.
So the two options `requestTimeout` and `disableTimeToLive` gives you
fine grained control when doing request/reply.

From *Camel 2.13/2.12.3* onwards you can provide a header in the message
to override and use as the request timeout value instead of the endpoint
configured value. For example:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------
   from("direct:someWhere")
     .to("jms:queue:foo?replyTo=bar&requestTimeout=30s")
     .to("bean:processReply");
--------------------------------------------------------

In the route above we have a endpoint configured `requestTimeout` of 30
seconds. So Camel will wait up till 30 seconds for that reply message to
come back on the bar queue. If no reply message is received then a
`org.apache.camel.ExchangeTimedOutException` is set on the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] and Camel continues routing the message,
which would then fail due the exception, and Camel's error handler
reacts.

If you want to use a per message timeout value, you can set the header
with key
`org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsConstants#JMS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` which
has constant value `"CamelJmsRequestTimeout"` with a timeout value as
long type.

For example we can use a bean to compute the timeout value per
individual message, such as calling the `"whatIsTheTimeout"` method on
the service bean as shown below:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   from("direct:someWhere")
     .setHeader("CamelJmsRequestTimeout", method(ServiceBean.class, "whatIsTheTimeout"))
     .to("jms:queue:foo?replyTo=bar&requestTimeout=30s")
     .to("bean:processReply");
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you do fire and forget (InOut) over link:jms.html[JMS] with Camel
then Camel by default does *not* set any time to live value on the
message. You can configure a value by using the `timeToLive` option. For
example to indicate a 5 sec., you set `timeToLive=5000`. The option
`disableTimeToLive` can be used to force disabling the time to live,
also for InOnly messaging. The `requestTimeout` option is not being used
for InOnly messaging.

### Enabling Transacted Consumption

A common requirement is to consume from a queue in a transaction and
then process the message using the Camel route. To do this, just ensure
that you set the following properties on the component/endpoint:

* `transacted` = true
* `transactionManager` = a _Transsaction Manager_ - typically the
`JmsTransactionManager`

See the link:transactional-client.html[Transactional Client] EIP pattern
for further details.

Transactions and [Request Reply] over JMS

When using link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] over JMS you cannot
use a single transaction; JMS will not send any messages until a commit
is performed, so the server side won't receive anything at all until the
transaction commits. Therefore to use link:request-reply.html[Request
Reply] you must commit a transaction after sending the request and then
use a separate transaction for receiving the response.

To address this issue the JMS component uses different properties to
specify transaction use for oneway messaging and request reply
messaging:

The `transacted` property applies *only* to the InOnly message
link:exchange-pattern.html[Exchange Pattern] (MEP).

The `transactedInOut` property applies to the
InOut(link:request-reply.html[Request Reply]) message
link:exchange-pattern.html[Exchange Pattern] (MEP).

If you want to use transactions for link:request-reply.html[Request
Reply](InOut MEP), you *must* set `transactedInOut=true`.

*Available as of Camel 2.10*

You can leverage the
http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/AbstractPollingMessageListenerContainer.html#setSessionTransacted(boolean)[DMLC
transacted session API] using the following properties on
component/endpoint:

* `transacted` = true
* `lazyCreateTransactionManager` = false

The benefit of doing so is that the cacheLevel setting will be honored
when using local transactions without a configured TransactionManager.
When a TransactionManager is configured, no caching happens at DMLC
level and its necessary to rely on a pooled connection factory. For more
details about this kind of setup see
http://tmielke.blogspot.com/2012/03/camel-jms-with-transactions-lessons.html[here]
and
http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?123631-JMS-DMLC-not-caching%20connection-when-using-TX-despite-cacheLevel-CACHE_CONSUMER&p=403530&posted=1#post403530[here].

### Using JMSReplyTo for late replies

When using Camel as a JMS listener, it sets an Exchange property with
the value of the ReplyTo `javax.jms.Destination` object, having the key
`ReplyTo`. You can obtain this `Destination` as follows:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Destination replyDestination = exchange.getIn().getHeader(JmsConstants.JMS_REPLY_DESTINATION, Destination.class);
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then later use it to send a reply using regular JMS or Camel.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // we need to pass in the JMS component, and in this sample we use ActiveMQ
    JmsEndpoint endpoint = JmsEndpoint.newInstance(replyDestination, activeMQComponent);
    // now we have the endpoint we can use regular Camel API to send a message to it
    template.sendBody(endpoint, "Here is the late reply.");
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A different solution to sending a reply is to provide the
`replyDestination` object in the same Exchange property when sending.
Camel will then pick up this property and use it for the real
destination. The endpoint URI must include a dummy destination, however.
For example:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // we pretend to send it to some non existing dummy queue
    template.send("activemq:queue:dummy, new Processor() {
        public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            // and here we override the destination with the ReplyTo destination object so the message is sent to there instead of dummy
            exchange.getIn().setHeader(JmsConstants.JMS_DESTINATION, replyDestination);
            exchange.getIn().setBody("Here is the late reply.");
        }
    }
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using a request timeout

In the sample below we send a link:request-reply.html[Request Reply]
style message link:exchange.html[Exchange] (we use the `requestBody`
method = `InOut`) to the slow queue for further processing in Camel and
we wait for a return reply:

### Samples

JMS is used in many examples for other components as well. But we
provide a few samples below to get started.

#### Receiving from JMS

In the following sample we configure a route that receives JMS messages
and routes the message to a POJO:

[source,java]
--------------------------------
   from("jms:queue:foo").
     to("bean:myBusinessLogic");
--------------------------------

You can of course use any of the EIP patterns so the route can be
context based. For example, here's how to filter an order topic for the
big spenders:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------
from("jms:topic:OrdersTopic").
  filter().method("myBean", "isGoldCustomer").
    to("jms:queue:BigSpendersQueue");
----------------------------------------------

#### Sending to JMS

In the sample below we poll a file folder and send the file content to a
JMS topic. As we want the content of the file as a `TextMessage` instead
of a `BytesMessage`, we need to convert the body to a `String`:

[source,java]
------------------------------
from("file://orders").
  convertBodyTo(String.class).
  to("jms:topic:OrdersTopic");
------------------------------

#### Using link:bean-integration.html[Annotations]

Camel also has annotations so you can use link:pojo-consuming.html[POJO
Consuming] and link:pojo-producing.html[POJO Producing].

#### Spring DSL sample

The preceding examples use the Java DSL. Camel also supports Spring XML
DSL. Here is the big spender sample using Spring DSL:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="jms:topic:OrdersTopic"/>
  <filter>
    <method bean="myBean" method="isGoldCustomer"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:BigSpendersQueue"/>
  </filter>
</route>
---------------------------------------------------

#### Other samples

JMS appears in many of the examples for other components and EIP
patterns, as well in this Camel documentation. So feel free to browse
the documentation. If you have time, check out the this tutorial that
uses JMS but focuses on how well Spring Remoting and Camel works
together link:tutorial-jmsremoting.html[Tutorial-JmsRemoting].

#### Using JMS as a Dead Letter Queue storing Exchange

Normally, when using link:jms.html[JMS] as the transport, it only
transfers the body and headers as the payload. If you want to use
link:jms.html[JMS] with a link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter
Channel], using a JMS queue as the Dead Letter Queue, then normally the
caused Exception is not stored in the JMS message. You can, however, use
the `transferExchange` option on the JMS dead letter queue to instruct
Camel to store the entire link:exchange.html[Exchange] in the queue as a
`javax.jms.ObjectMessage` that holds a
`org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExchangeHolder`. This allows you to
consume from the Dead Letter Queue and retrieve the caused exception
from the Exchange property with the key `Exchange.EXCEPTION_CAUGHT`. The
demo below illustrates this:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
// setup error handler to use JMS as queue and store the entire Exchange
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("jms:queue:dead?transferExchange=true"));
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then you can consume from the JMS queue and analyze the problem:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jms:queue:dead").to("bean:myErrorAnalyzer");

// and in our bean
String body = exchange.getIn().getBody();
Exception cause = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.EXCEPTION_CAUGHT, Exception.class);
// the cause message is
String problem = cause.getMessage();
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Using JMS as a Dead Letter Channel storing error only

You can use JMS to store the cause error message or to store a custom
body, which you can initialize yourself. The following example uses the
link:message-translator.html[Message Translator] EIP to do a
transformation on the failed exchange before it is moved to the
link:jms.html[JMS] dead letter queue:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// we sent it to a seda dead queue first
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("seda:dead"));

// and on the seda dead queue we can do the custom transformation before its sent to the JMS queue
from("seda:dead").transform(exceptionMessage()).to("jms:queue:dead");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we only store the original cause error message in the transform.
You can, however, use any link:expression.html[Expression] to send
whatever you like. For example, you can invoke a method on a Bean or use
a custom processor.

### Sending an InOnly message and keeping the JMSReplyTo header

When sending to a link:jms.html[JMS] destination using *camel-jms* the
producer will use the MEP to detect if its _InOnly_ or _InOut_ messaging.
However there can be times where you want to send an _InOnly_ message but
keeping the `JMSReplyTo` header. To do so you have to instruct Camel to
keep it, otherwise the `JMSReplyTo` header will be dropped.

For example to send an _InOnly_ message to the foo queue, but with a
`JMSReplyTo` with bar queue you can do as follows:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        template.send("activemq:queue:foo?preserveMessageQos=true", new Processor() {
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                exchange.getIn().setBody("World");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader("JMSReplyTo", "bar");
            }
        });
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice we use `preserveMessageQos=true` to instruct Camel to keep the
`JMSReplyTo` header.

### Setting JMS provider options on the destination

Some JMS providers, like IBM's WebSphere MQ need options to be set on
the JMS destination. For example, you may need to specify the
`targetClient` option. Since `targetClient` is a WebSphere MQ option and not
a Camel URI option, you need to set that on the JMS destination name
like so:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ...
.setHeader("CamelJmsDestinationName", constant("queue:///MY_QUEUE?targetClient=1"))
.to("wmq:queue:MY_QUEUE?useMessageIDAsCorrelationID=true");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some versions of WMQ won't accept this option on the destination name
and you will get an exception like:

[source]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
com.ibm.msg.client.jms.DetailedJMSException: JMSCC0005: The specified
value 'MY_QUEUE?targetClient=1' is not allowed for
'XMSC_DESTINATION_NAME'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A workaround is to use a custom DestinationResolver:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JmsComponent wmq = new JmsComponent(connectionFactory);

wmq.setDestinationResolver(new DestinationResolver() {
    public Destination resolveDestinationName(Session session, String destinationName, boolean pubSubDomain) throws JMSException {
        MQQueueSession wmqSession = (MQQueueSession) session;
        return wmqSession.createQueue("queue:///" + destinationName + "?targetClient=1");
    }
});
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
