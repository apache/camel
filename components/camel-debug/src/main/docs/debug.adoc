*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-debug enables Camel debugger for 3rd party tooling.
This makes it easier to perform debugging in IDEs such as IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode

IMPORTANT: The camel-debug is only for development purposes, it should **not** be used for production.

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-debug` dependency to the classpath,
and Camel should auto-detect this on startup and log as follows:

[source,text]
----
Detected: camel-debug JAR (Enabling Camel Debugging)
----

== JMX remote connection

To make it possible for 3rd party tooling to connect to the running Camel application,
and to perform debugging actions, then Camel will expose a JMX RMI connector port,
that the tools can use to connect via that allows JMX remote management.

The service URL to connect is:

[source,text]
----
service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/camel
