*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-debug enables Camel debugger for 3rd party tooling.
This makes it easier to perform debugging in IDEs such as IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode

IMPORTANT: The camel-debug is only for development purposes, it should **not** be used for production.

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-debug` dependency to the classpath,
and Camel should auto-detect this on startup and log as follows:

[source,text]
----
Detected: camel-debug JAR (enabling Camel Debugging)
