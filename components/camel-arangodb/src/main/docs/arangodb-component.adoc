*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The ArangoDb component is a ArangoDb client that uses the https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb-java-driver[arango java driver] to perform queries on collections and graphs in the ArangoDb database.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-arangodb</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The ArangoDb component supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (producer) | Component configuration |  | ArangoDbConfiguration
| *documentCollection* (producer) | Collection name, when using ArangoDb as a Document Database. Set the documentCollection name when using the CRUD operation on the document database collections (SAVE_DOCUMENT , FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY, UPDATE_DOCUMENT, DELETE_DOCUMENT). |  | String
| *edgeCollection* (producer) | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the edgeCollection name to perform CRUD operation on edges using these operations : SAVE_VERTEX, FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY, UPDATE_VERTEX, DELETE_VERTEX. The graph attribute is mandatory. |  | String
| *graph* (producer) | Graph name, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Combine this attribute with one of the two attributes vertexCollection and edgeCollection. |  | String
| *host* (producer) | ArangoDB host. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | Operations to perform on ArangoDb. For the operation AQL_QUERY, no need to specify a collection or graph. There are 13 enums and the value can be one of: SAVE_DOCUMENT, FIND_DOCUMENT_BY_KEY, UPDATE_DOCUMENT, DELETE_DOCUMENT, AQL_QUERY, SAVE_VERTEX, FIND_VERTEX_BY_KEY, UPDATE_VERTEX, DELETE_VERTEX, SAVE_EDGE, FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY, UPDATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE |  | ArangoDbOperation
| *port* (producer) | ArangoDB exposed port. If host and port are default, this field is Optional. |  | int
| *vertexCollection* (producer) | Collection name of vertices, when using ArangoDb as a Graph Database. Set the vertexCollection name to perform CRUD operation on vertices using these operations : SAVE_EDGE, FIND_EDGE_BY_KEY, UPDATE_EDGE, DELETE_EDGE. The graph attribute is mandatory. |  | String
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *password* (security) | ArangoDB password. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. |  | String
| *user* (security) | ArangoDB user. If user and password are default, this field is Optional. |  | String

== Endpoint Options

The ArangoDb endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
arangodb:database
----

with the following path and query parameters:

== Examples

=== Producer Examples

==== Save document on a collection

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:insert")
  .to("arangodb:testDb?documentCollection=collection&operation=SAVE_DOCUMENT");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And you can set as body a BaseDocument class 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        BaseDocument myObject = new BaseDocument();
        myObject.addAttribute("a", "Foo");
        myObject.addAttribute("b", 42);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Query a collection

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:query")
  .to("arangodb:testDb?operation=AQL_QUERY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And you can invoke an AQL Query in this way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        String query = "FOR t IN " + COLLECTION_NAME + " FILTER t.value == @value";
        Map<String, Object> bindVars = new MapBuilder().put("value", "hello")
                .get();

        Exchange result = template.request("direct:query", exchange -> {
            exchange.getMessage().setHeader(AQL_QUERY, query);
            exchange.getMessage().setHeader(AQL_QUERY_BIND_PARAMETERS, bindVars);
        });
