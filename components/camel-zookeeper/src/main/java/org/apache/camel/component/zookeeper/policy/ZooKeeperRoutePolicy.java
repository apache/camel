/**
 * <code>ZooKeeperRoutePolicy</code> uses the leader election capabilities of a
 * ZooKeeper cluster to control how routes are enabled. It is typically used in
 * fail-over scenarios controlling identical instances of a route across a
 * cluster of Camel based servers.
 * <p>
 * The policy is configured with a 'top n' number of routes that should be
 * allowed to start, for a master/slave scenario this would be 1. Each instance
 * of the policy will execute the election algorithm to obtain its position in
 * the hierarchy of servers, if it is within the 'top n' servers then the policy
 * is enabled and exchanges can be processed by the route. If not it waits for a
 * change in the leader hierarchy and then reruns this scenario to see if it is
 * now in the top n.
 * <p>
 * All instances of the policy must also be configured with the same path on the
 * ZooKeeper cluster where the election will be carried out. It is good practice
 * for this to indicate the application e.g. <tt>/someapplication/someroute/</tt> note
 * that these nodes should exist before using the policy.
 * <p>
 * See <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/recipes.html#sc_leaderElection">
 *     for more on how Leader election</a> is archived with ZooKeeper.
