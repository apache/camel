The ZooKeeper component allows interaction with a
https://zookeeper.apache.org/[ZooKeeper] cluster and exposes the
following features to Camel:

1.  Creation of nodes in any of the ZooKeeper create modes.
2.  Get and Set the data contents of arbitrary cluster nodes (data
being set must be convertible to `byte[]`).
3.  Create and retrieve the list the child nodes attached to a
particular node.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-zookeeper</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

== URI format

----
zookeeper://zookeeper-server[:port][/path][?options]
----

The path from the URI specifies the node in the ZooKeeper server (a.k.a.
_znode_) that will be the target of the endpoint:



// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END

// component headers: START
include::partial$component-endpoint-headers.adoc[]
// component headers: END

== Use cases

=== Reading from a _znode_

The following snippet will read the data from the _znode_
`/somepath/somenode/` provided that it already exists. The data
retrieved will be placed into an exchange and passed onto
the rest of the route:

[source,java]
----
from("zookeeper://localhost:39913/somepath/somenode").to("mock:result");
----

If the node does not yet exist then a flag can be supplied to have the
endpoint await its creation:

[source,java]
----
from("zookeeper://localhost:39913/somepath/somenode?awaitCreation=true").to("mock:result");
----

=== Reading from a _znode_

When data is read due to a `WatchedEvent` received from the ZooKeeper
ensemble, the `CamelZookeeperEventType` header holds ZooKeeper's
http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/api/org/apache/zookeeper/Watcher.Event.EventType.html[`EventType`]
value from that `WatchedEvent`. If the data is read initially (not
triggered by a `WatchedEvent`) the `CamelZookeeperEventType` header will not
be set.

=== Writing to a _znode_

The following snippet will write the payload of the exchange into the
znode at `/somepath/somenode/` provided that it already exists:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:write-to-znode")
    .to("zookeeper://localhost:39913/somepath/somenode");
----

For flexibility, the endpoint allows the target _znode_ to be specified
dynamically as a message header. If a header keyed by the string
`CamelZooKeeperNode` is present then the value of the header will be
used as the path to the _znode_ on the server. For instance using the same
route definition above, the following code snippet will write the data
not to `/somepath/somenode` but to the path from the header
`/somepath/someothernode`.

WARNING: the `testPayload` must be convertible
to `byte[]` as the data stored in ZooKeeper is byte based.

[source,java]
----
Object testPayload = ...
template.sendBodyAndHeader("direct:write-to-znode", testPayload, "CamelZooKeeperNode", "/somepath/someothernode");
----

To also create the node if it does not exist the `create` option should
be used.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:create-and-write-to-znode")
    .to("zookeeper://localhost:39913/somepath/somenode?create=true");
----

It is also possible to *delete* a node using the
header `CamelZookeeperOperation` by setting it to `DELETE`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:delete-znode")
    .setHeader(ZooKeeperMessage.ZOOKEEPER_OPERATION, constant("DELETE"))
    .to("zookeeper://localhost:39913/somepath/somenode");
----

or equivalently:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:delete-znode" />
  <setHeader name="CamelZookeeperOperation">
     <constant>DELETE</constant>
  </setHeader>
  <to uri="zookeeper://localhost:39913/somepath/somenode" />
</route>
----

ZooKeeper nodes can have different types; they can be 'Ephemeral' or
'Persistent' and 'Sequenced' or 'Unsequenced'. For further information
of each type you can check
http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Ephemeral+Nodes[here].
By default endpoints will create unsequenced, ephemeral nodes, but the
type can be easily manipulated via a uri config parameter or via a
special message header. The values expected for the create mode are
simply the names from the `CreateMode` enumeration:

* `PERSISTENT`
* `PERSISTENT_SEQUENTIAL`
* `EPHEMERAL`
* `EPHEMERAL_SEQUENTIAL`

For example to create a persistent _znode_ via the URI config:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:create-and-write-to-persistent-znode")
    .to("zookeeper://localhost:39913/somepath/somenode?create=true&createMode=PERSISTENT");
----

or using the header `CamelZookeeperCreateMode`.

WARNING: the `testPayload` must be convertible to `byte[]` as the data stored in
ZooKeeper is byte based.

[source,java]
----
Object testPayload = ...
template.sendBodyAndHeader("direct:create-and-write-to-persistent-znode", testPayload, "CamelZooKeeperCreateMode", "PERSISTENT");
