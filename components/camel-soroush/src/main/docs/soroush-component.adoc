== SoroushBot Component

*Available as of Camel version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT*

The *Soroush* component provide access to the https://soroush-app.ir/developer.html[Soroush Bot API].
It allows a Camel-based application to send and receive message by acting as a Bot, i.e. participate in direct conversation with normal users and send and receive message and files

A Soroush Bot must be created before using this component, following the
instruction at the
link:https://soroush-app.ir/developer.html[Soroush Bot Developers home].
when a new Bot is created, the link:https://sapp.ir/mrbot[MrBot] provides
an **authorization token** corresponding to the Bot. The authorization token is a mandatory parameter for camel-soroush endpoint.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:
