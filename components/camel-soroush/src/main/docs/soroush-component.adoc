== SoroushBot Component

*Available as of Camel version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT*

The *Soroush* component provide access to the https://soroush-app.ir/developer.html[Soroush Bot API].
It allows a Camel-based application to send and receive message by acting as a Bot, i.e. participate in direct conversation with normal users and send and receive message and files

A Soroush Bot must be created before using this component, following the
instruction at the
link:https://soroush-app.ir/developer.html[Soroush Bot Developers home].
when a new Bot is created, the link:https://sapp.ir/mrbot[MrBot] provides
an **authorization token** corresponding to the Bot. The authorization token is a mandatory parameter for camel-soroush endpoint.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-soroush</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Soroush Component support 4 types of endpoint that can be specified in
uri path:

[width="100%",cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===
|Type| Description
|*getMessage* (Consumer)
|With this endpoint you can receive message from users.

|*sendMessage* (Producer)
|By sending exchange to this endpoint, you can send message to users.

|*downloadFile* (Producer)
|By sending a message to this endpoint the component tries to download
message attachments (file & thumbnail) if exists. and store them in
`SoroushMessage.file` and `SoroushMessage.thumbnail`

|*uploadFile* (Producer)
|By sending a message to this endpoint it will upload file and thumbnail
attachments if provided in the message  (`SoroushMessage.file`, `SoroushMessage.thumbnail`)
and store the urls in the message (`SoroushMessage.fileUrl`, `SoroushMessage.thumbnailUrl`)
|===



// component options: START
The SoroushBot component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *authorizationToken* (security) | The default Soroush authorization token to be used when the information is not provided in the endpoints. |  | String
| *resolveProperty Placeholders* (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END
// endpoint options: START
The SoroushBot endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
soroush:<connectionType>[/authorizationToken][?options]
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *connectionType* | *Required* The endpoint type. it support getMessage as consumer and sendMessage,uploadFile,downloadFile as producer |  | ConnectionType
| *authorizationToken* |  The authorization token for using the bot. |  | String
|===


==== Query Parameters (14 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *authorizationToken* (security) | The authorization token for using the bot. if uri path does not contain authorization token, this token will be used. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *concurrentConsumers* (consumer) | number of thread created by consumer in the route. if you use this method for parallelism, it is guaranteed that message from same user always execute in the same thread and therefore messages from the same user are processed sequentially. Default value notice: using SoroushBotSingleThreadConsumer | 1 | Integer
| *queueCapacityPerThread* (consumer) | maximum capacity of each queue when concurrentConsumers is greater than 1. if a queue become full, every message that should goes to that queue will be dropped. if bridgeErrorHandler sets to true, an exchange with CongestionException is directed to ErrorHandler. you can then processed the error using onException(CongestionException.class) route. Default value notice: infinite capacity | 0 | Integer
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *autoDownload* (getMessage) | automatically download SoroushMessage.fileUrl and SoroushMessage.thumbnailUrl if exists for the message and store them in SoroushMessage.file and SoroushMessage.thumbnail field | false | Boolean
| *downloadThumbnail* (downloadFile) | if true, when downloading attached file, thumbnail will be downloaded if provided in the message. otherwise only the file will be downloaded | true | Boolean
| *forceDownload* (downloadFile) | force to download SoroushMessage.fileUrl(SoroushMessage.thumbnailUrl) if exists, even if the SoroushMessage.file(SoroushMessage.thumbnail) was not null in that message | false | Boolean
| *connectionTimeout* (global) | connection timeout in ms when connecting to soroush API | 30000 | Integer
| *maxConnectionRetry* (global) | maximum connection retry when fail to connect to soroush API, if the quota is reached, MaximumConnectionRetryReachedException is thrown for that message. | 4 | Integer
| *autoUploadFile* (sendMessage) | automatically upload attachments when message goes to the sendMessage endpoint and the SoroushMessage.file (SoroushMessage.thumbnail) has been set and SoroushMessage.fileUrl(SoroushMessage.thumbnailUrl) is null | true | Boolean
| *forceUpload* (uploadFile) | force to upload SoroushMessage.file(SoroushMessage.thumbnail) if exists, even if the SoroushMessage.fileUrl(SoroushMessage.thumbnailUrl) is not null in the message | false | Boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


=== Usage

every exchange that you send to soroush endpoint must contains
body of type `org.apache.camel.component.soroushbot.models.MessageModel`.
Similarly  every exchange you receive from soroush endpoint contains a body
of `MessageModel` too.

[source,java]
------------
SoroushMessage message = exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class)
------------

==== Receive Message
With this endpoint you can receive message from users.

The following is a basic example of how to receive all messages that your Soroush users are sending to the configured Bot.
In Java DSL:

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken?autoDownload=true")
    .bean(ProcessorBean.class);
-------------
and in Spring XML
[source,xml]
------------
<route>
    <from uri="soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken?autoDownload=true"/>
    <bean ref="processorBean" />
<route>

<bean id="processorBean" class="com.example.ProcessorBean"/>
------------

==== Download File
this endpoint is useful when you want to conditionally download the files specified in the message.

The following is an example of how to conditionally download file in the messages.

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .choice().when(exchange -> {
        SoroushMessage soroushMessage = exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class);
        return soroushMessage.getFileSize()!=null && soroushMessage.getFileSize()<10000;
                               })
    .to("soroush:downloadFile/YourAuthorizationToken");
    .end()
    .bean(ProcessorBean.class)
-------------

==== Send Message
this endpoint is your primary way to send message and upload file. you can simply
send message to a user by sending the message to this endpoint

this is simple example that simply reply user message with the same message

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .process(exchange->{
        SoroushMessage soroushMessage = exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class);
        soroushMessage.setTo(soroushMessage.getFrom());
    })
    .to("soroush:sendMessage/YourAuthorizationToken");
-------------

====== Auto Upload Attachments
This endpoint can help you to automatically upload file and thumbnails of a message to the server
and set `fileUrl` and `thumbnailUrl` of that message to proper value that taken from Soroush Upload File Api.
The only thing you need to do is setting `SoroushMessage.file` and `SoroushMessage.thumbnail` property.
there are 4 utility method is provided for this purpose:

[source,java]
-------------
SoroushMessage.setFile(File file)
SoroushMessage.setFile(InputStream fileStream)
SoroushMessage.setThumbnail(File thumbnail)
SoroushMessage.setThumbnail(InputStream thumbnailStream)
-------------


==== Upload File
this endpoint is a utility endpoint that allows you to upload a file without sending the message.
the only thing you need to do for uploading file is to set `SoroushMessage.file` and `Send Message.thumbnail`
and this endpoint upload these file to Soroush server

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .process(exchage->{
        SoroushMessage response = new SoroushMessage();
        response.setTo(exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class).getFrom());
        response.setFile(new File("MyResponse.jpg"))
    })
    .to("soroush:uploadFile/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .process(exchage->System.out.println(exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class).getFileUrl())
-------------

=== Error Handling
there are 3 type of exceptions that can be produced in Soroush Component.
[width="100%",cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===
|Exception| Description

|CongestionException
|this exception occurs when `bridgeErrorHandler=true` and you use more than 1 concurrentConsumer (`concurrentConsumers>1`)
and `queueCapacityPerThread` is reached for a queue, on any message that goes to that queue,
a CongestionException will throw.

|MaximumConnectionRetryReachedException
|when the component could not connect to the Soroush server for more than `MaxConnectionRetry` times

|SoroushException
|when a request is rejected by Soroush Server.

|===

one way to handle these exceptions using `onException` route definition

[source,java]
-------------
onException(CongestionException.class).log("Failed to processing ${id}")
-------------
