*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Soroush component provides access to the https://soroush-app.ir/developer.html[Soroush Bot API].
It allows a Camel-based application to send and receive messages by acting as a Bot, i.e. participating in direct conversation with normal users and send and receive message and files

A Soroush Bot must be created before using this component, following the
instruction at the
https://soroush-app.ir/developer.html[Soroush Bot Developers home].
when a new Bot is created, the https://sapp.ir/mrbot[MrBot] provides
an **authorization token** corresponding to the Bot. The authorization token is a mandatory parameter for camel-soroush endpoint.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-soroush</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Soroush Component supports 4 types of endpoint that can be specified in
uri path:

[width="100%",cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===
|Type| Description
|*getMessage* (Consumer)
|With this endpoint you can receive messages from users.

|*sendMessage* (Producer)
|By sending exchange to this endpoint, you can send messages to users.

|*downloadFile* (Producer)
|By sending a message to this endpoint the component tries to download
message attachments (file & thumbnail) if exists, and store them in
`SoroushMessage.file` and `SoroushMessage.thumbnail`.

|*uploadFile* (Producer)
|By sending a message to this endpoint it will upload file and thumbnail
attachments if provided in the message  (`SoroushMessage.file`, `SoroushMessage.thumbnail`)
and store the urls in the message (`SoroushMessage.fileUrl`, `SoroushMessage.thumbnailUrl`).

== Usage

Every exchange that you send to soroush endpoint must contain a
body of type `org.apache.camel.component.soroushbot.models.MessageModel`.
Similarly, every exchange you receive from soroush endpoint contains a body
of `MessageModel` too.

[source,java]
------------
SoroushMessage message = exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class)
------------

=== Receive Message
With this endpoint you can receive messages from users.

The following is a basic example of how to receive all messages that your Soroush users are sending to the configured Bot.
In Java DSL:

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken?autoDownload=true")
    .bean(ProcessorBean.class);
-------------
and in Spring XML
[source,xml]
------------
<route>
    <from uri="soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken?autoDownload=true"/>
    <bean ref="processorBean" />
<route>

<bean id="processorBean" class="com.example.ProcessorBean"/>
------------

=== Download File
This endpoint is useful when you want to conditionally download the files specified in the message.
When you send a message to this endpoint it opens a connection to Soroush Server
for downloading the files and store `InputStream` of that connection in
`SoroushMessage.file` and `SoroushMessage.thumbnail` and then you can read contents of the files.

[NOTE]
====
If you delay reading from these streams, the Soroush server may close the connection.
You are responsible for storing attachment files on your disc if needed.
====

Please refer to  Query Parameters table for more information.

The following is an example of how to conditionally download files in the messages.

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .choice().when(exchange -> {
        SoroushMessage soroushMessage = exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class);
        return soroushMessage.getFileSize()!=null && soroushMessage.getFileSize()<10000;
                               })
    .to("soroush:downloadFile/YourAuthorizationToken");
    .otherwise().stop()
    .end()
    .bean(ProcessorBean.class)
-------------

=== Send Message
This endpoint is your primary way to send messages and upload files. You can simply
send a message to a user by sending the message to this endpoint.

This is a simple example that simply replies every user messages with the same message.

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .process(exchange->{
        SoroushMessage soroushMessage = exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class);
        soroushMessage.setTo(soroushMessage.getFrom());
    })
    .to("soroush:sendMessage/YourAuthorizationToken");
-------------

=== Auto Upload Attachments
This endpoint can help you to automatically upload files and thumbnails of a message to the server
and set `fileUrl` and `thumbnailUrl` of that message to proper values taken from Soroush Upload File Api.
The only thing you need to do is setting `SoroushMessage.file` and `SoroushMessage.thumbnail` properties.
There are 4 utility methods provided for this purpose:

[source,java]
-------------
SoroushMessage.setFile(File file)
SoroushMessage.setFile(InputStream fileStream)
SoroushMessage.setThumbnail(File thumbnail)
SoroushMessage.setThumbnail(InputStream thumbnailStream)
-------------


=== Upload File
This endpoint is a utility endpoint that allows you to upload a file without sending the message.
The only thing you need to do for uploading a file is to set `SoroushMessage.file` and `Send Message.thumbnail`
and this endpoint upload them to the Soroush server.

[source,java]
-------------
from("soroush:getMessage/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .process(exchage->{
        SoroushMessage response = new SoroushMessage();
        response.setTo(exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class).getFrom());
        response.setFile(new File("MyResponse.jpg"))
    })
    .to("soroush:uploadFile/YourAuthorizationToken")
    .process(exchage->System.out.println(exchange.getIn().getBody(SoroushMessage.class).getFileUrl())
-------------

=== Error Handling
There are 3 types of exceptions that can be produced in Soroush Component.
[width="100%",cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===
|Exception| Description

|CongestionException
|this exception occurs when `bridgeErrorHandler=true` and you use more than 1 concurrentConsumer (`concurrentConsumers>1`)
and `queueCapacityPerThread` is reached for a queue, on any message that goes to that queue,
a CongestionException will throw.

|MaximumConnectionRetryReachedException
|when the component could not connect to the Soroush server for more than `MaxConnectionRetry` times

|SoroushException
|when a request is rejected by Soroush Server.

|===

One way to handle these exceptions is by using `onException` route definition:

[source,java]
-------------
onException(CongestionException.class).log("Failed to processing ${id}")
-------------
