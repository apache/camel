*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 DynamoDB Stream component supports receiving messages from
Amazon DynamoDB Stream service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon DynamoDB Streams. More information are available
at https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/[AWS DynamoDB]

[NOTE]
====
The AWS2 DynamoDB Streams component is not supported in OSGI
====

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------------
aws2-ddbstream://table-name[?options]
------------------------------------

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS 2 DynamoDB Streams component supports 14 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonDynamoDbStreamsClient* (consumer) | *Autowired* Amazon DynamoDB client to use for all requests for this endpoint |  | DynamoDbStreamsClient
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *configuration* (consumer) | The component configuration |  | Ddb2StreamConfiguration
| *iteratorType* (consumer) | Defines where in the DynaboDB stream to start getting records. Note that using TRIM_HORIZON can cause a significant delay before the stream has caught up to real-time. if {AT,AFTER}_SEQUENCE_NUMBER are used, then a sequenceNumberProvider MUST be supplied. There are 5 enums and the value can be one of: TRIM_HORIZON, LATEST, AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER, AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER, null | LATEST | ShardIteratorType
| *maxResultsPerRequest* (consumer) | Maximum number of records that will be fetched in each poll |  | int
| *proxyHost* (consumer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the DDBStreams client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (consumer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the DDBStreams client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (consumer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the DDBStreams client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (consumer) | The region in which DDBStreams client needs to work |  | String
| *sequenceNumberProvider* (consumer) | Provider for the sequence number when using one of the two ShardIteratorType.{AT,AFTER}_SEQUENCE_NUMBER iterator types. Can be a registry reference or a literal sequence number. |  | SequenceNumberProvider
| *trustAllCertificates* (consumer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

Required DynamoDBStream component options

You have to provide the DynamoDbStreamsClient in the
Registry with proxies and relevant credentials
configured.

== Sequence Numbers

You can provide a literal string as the sequence number or provide a
bean in the registry. An example of using the bean would be to save your
current position in the change feed and restore it on Camel startup.

It is an error to provide a sequence number that is greater than the
largest sequence number in the describe-streams result, as this will
lead to the AWS call returning an HTTP 400.

== Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

== Usage

== Coping with Downtime

=== AWS DynamoDB Streams outage of less than 24 hours

The consumer will resume from the last seen sequence number (as
implemented
for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-9515[CAMEL-9515]), so
you should receive a flood of events in quick succession, as long as the
outage did not also include DynamoDB itself.

=== AWS DynamoDB Streams outage of more than 24 hours

Given that AWS only retain 24 hours worth of changes, you will have
missed change events no matter what mitigations are in place.

== Automatic detection of AmazonDynamoDBStreams client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonDynamoDBStreams bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-ddb</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
