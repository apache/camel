[[aws-ddb-component]]
= AWS DynamoDB Component

*Since Camel 2.10*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The DynamoDB component supports storing and retrieving data from/to
https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon's DynamoDB] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon DynamoDB. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon DynamoDB].

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws-ddb://domainName[?options]
------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS DynamoDB component supports 6 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *region* (producer) | The region in which DDB client needs to work |  | String
| *secretKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | The AWS DDB default configuration |  | DdbConfiguration
|===

// endpoint options: START
The AWS DynamoDB endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-ddb-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>

=== Advanced AmazonDynamoDB configuration

If you need more control over the `AmazonDynamoDB` instance
configuration you can create your own instance and refer to it from the
URI:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("aws-ddb://domainName?amazonDDBClient=#client");
----------------------------------------------------

The `#client` refers to a `AmazonDynamoDB` in the
Registry.

For example if your Camel Application is running behind a firewall:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");
ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonDynamoDB client = new AmazonDynamoDBClient(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Supported producer operations

- BatchGetItems
- DeleteItem
- DeleteTable
- DescribeTable
- GetItem
- PutItem
- Query
- Scan
- UpdateItem
- UpdateTable

== Automatic detection of AmazonDynamoDB client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonDynamoDB bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-ddb</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version\}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
