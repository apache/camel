= SQL Component

*Since Camel 1.4*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The SQL component allows you to work with databases using JDBC
queries. The difference between this component and xref:jdbc-component.adoc[JDBC]
component is that in case of SQL the query is a property of the endpoint
and it uses message payload as parameters passed to the query.

This component uses `spring-jdbc` behind the scenes for the actual SQL
handling.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-sql</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

The SQL component also supports:

* a JDBC based repository for the
Idempotent Consumer EIP pattern. See
further below.
* a JDBC based repository for the Aggregator EIP
pattern. See further below.

== URI format

[TIP]
====
This component can be used as a
http://camel.apache.org/transactional-client.html[Transactional Client].
====

The SQL component uses the following endpoint URI notation:

[source,text]
----
sql:select * from table where id=# order by name[?options]
----

You can use named parameters by using
:`#name_of_the_parameter` style as shown:

[source,text]
----
sql:select * from table where id=:#myId order by name[?options]
----

When using named parameters, Camel will lookup the names from, in the
given precedence:

1. from message body if its a `java.util.Map`
2. from message headers

If a named parameter cannot be resolved, then an exception is thrown.

You can use Simple expressions as parameters as
shown:

[source,text]
----
sql:select * from table where id=:#${property.myId} order by name[?options]
----

Notice that the standard `?` symbol that denotes the parameters to an
SQL query is substituted with the `pass:[#]` symbol, because the `?` symbol is
used to specify options for the endpoint. The `?` symbol replacement can
be configured on endpoint basis.

You can externalize your SQL queries to files
in the classpath or file system as shown:

[source,text]
----
sql:classpath:sql/myquery.sql[?options]
----

And the myquery.sql file is in the classpath and is just a plain text

[source,sql]
----
-- this is a comment
select *
from table
where
  id = :#${property.myId}
order by
  name
----

In the file you can use multilines and format the SQL as you wish. And
also use comments such as the – dash line.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options



// component options: START
The SQL component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *dataSource* (common) | Sets the DataSource to use to communicate with the database. |  | DataSource
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *usePlaceholder* (advanced) | Sets whether to use placeholder and replace all placeholder characters with sign in the SQL queries. This option is default true | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The SQL endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
sql:query
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *query* | *Required* Sets the SQL query to perform. You can externalize the query by using file: or classpath: as prefix and specify the location of the file. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (48 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *allowNamedParameters* (common) | Whether to allow using named parameters in the queries. | true | boolean
| *dataSource* (common) | Sets the DataSource to use to communicate with the database. |  | DataSource
| *dataSourceRef* (common) | *Deprecated* Sets the reference to a DataSource to lookup from the registry, to use for communicating with the database. |  | String
| *outputClass* (common) | Specify the full package and class name to use as conversion when outputType=SelectOne. |  | String
| *outputHeader* (common) | Store the query result in a header instead of the message body. By default, outputHeader == null and the query result is stored in the message body, any existing content in the message body is discarded. If outputHeader is set, the value is used as the name of the header to store the query result and the original message body is preserved. |  | String
| *outputType* (common) | Make the output of consumer or producer to SelectList as List of Map, or SelectOne as single Java object in the following way: a) If the query has only single column, then that JDBC Column object is returned. (such as SELECT COUNT( ) FROM PROJECT will return a Long object. b) If the query has more than one column, then it will return a Map of that result. c) If the outputClass is set, then it will convert the query result into an Java bean object by calling all the setters that match the column names. It will assume your class has a default constructor to create instance with. d) If the query resulted in more than one rows, it throws an non-unique result exception. StreamList streams the result of the query using an Iterator. This can be used with the Splitter EIP in streaming mode to process the ResultSet in streaming fashion. The value can be one of: SelectOne, SelectList, StreamList | SelectList | SqlOutputType
| *separator* (common) | The separator to use when parameter values is taken from message body (if the body is a String type), to be inserted at # placeholders. Notice if you use named parameters, then a Map type is used instead. The default value is comma | , | char
| *breakBatchOnConsumeFail* (consumer) | Sets whether to break batch if onConsume failed. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

| *maxMessagesPerPoll* (consumer) | Sets the maximum number of messages to poll |  | int
| *onConsume* (consumer) | After processing each row then this query can be executed, if the Exchange was processed successfully, for example to mark the row as processed. The query can have parameter. |  | String
| *onConsumeBatchComplete* (consumer) | After processing the entire batch, this query can be executed to bulk update rows etc. The query cannot have parameters. |  | String
| *onConsumeFailed* (consumer) | After processing each row then this query can be executed, if the Exchange failed, for example to mark the row as failed. The query can have parameter. |  | String
| *routeEmptyResultSet* (consumer) | Sets whether empty resultset should be allowed to be sent to the next hop. Defaults to false. So the empty resultset will be filtered out. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *transacted* (consumer) | Enables or disables transaction. If enabled then if processing an exchange failed then the consumer breaks out processing any further exchanges to cause a rollback eager. | false | boolean
| *useIterator* (consumer) | Sets how resultset should be delivered to route. Indicates delivery as either a list or individual object. defaults to true. | true | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy

| *batch* (producer) | Enables or disables batch mode | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean

| *useMessageBodyForSql* (producer) | Whether to use the message body as the SQL and then headers for parameters. If this option is enabled then the SQL in the uri is not used. Note that query parameters in the message body are represented by a question mark instead of a # symbol. | false | boolean
| *alwaysPopulateStatement* (advanced) | If enabled then the populateStatement method from org.apache.camel.component.sql.SqlPrepareStatementStrategy is always invoked, also if there is no expected parameters to be prepared. When this is false then the populateStatement is only invoked if there is 1 or more expected parameters to be set; for example this avoids reading the message body/headers for SQL queries with no parameters. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *parametersCount* (advanced) | If set greater than zero, then Camel will use this count value of parameters to replace instead of querying via JDBC metadata API. This is useful if the JDBC vendor could not return correct parameters count, then user may override instead. |  | int
| *placeholder* (advanced) | Specifies a character that will be replaced to in SQL query. Notice, that it is simple String.replaceAll() operation and no SQL parsing is involved (quoted strings will also change). | # | String
| *prepareStatementStrategy* (advanced) | Allows to plugin to use a custom org.apache.camel.component.sql.SqlPrepareStatementStrategy to control preparation of the query and prepared statement. |  | SqlPrepareStatementStrategy

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel

| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END



== Treatment of the message body

The SQL component tries to convert the message body to an object of
`java.util.Iterator` type and then uses this iterator to fill the query
parameters (where each query parameter is represented by a `pass:[#]` symbol
(or configured placeholder) in the endpoint URI). If the message body is
not an array or collection, the conversion results in an iterator that
iterates over only one object, which is the body itself.

For example, if the message body is an instance of `java.util.List`, the
first item in the list is substituted into the first occurrence of `pass:[#]`
in the SQL query, the second item in the list is substituted into the
second occurrence of `pass:[#]`, and so on.

If `batch` is set to `true`, then the interpretation of the inbound
message body changes slightly – instead of an iterator of parameters,
the component expects an iterator that contains the parameter iterators;
the size of the outer iterator determines the batch size.

You can use the option `useMessageBodyForSql` that
allows to use the message body as the SQL statement, and then the SQL
parameters must be provided in a header with the
key `SqlConstants.SQL_PARAMETERS`. This allows the SQL component to work
more dynamically as the SQL query is from the message body. Use
https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/templating.html[Camel templating]
for conditional processing, e.g. to include or exclude `where` clauses
depending on the presence of query parameters.

== Result of the query

For `select` operations, the result is an instance of
`List<Map<String, Object>>` type, as returned by the
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate.html#queryForList(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object%91%93)[JdbcTemplate.queryForList()]
method. For `update` operations, a `NULL` body is returned as the `update` operation is only set as a header and never as a body.

[NOTE]
====
See <<sql-component-header-values, Header values>> for more information on the `update` operation.
====

By default, the result is placed in the message body.  If the
outputHeader parameter is set, the result is placed in the header.  This
is an alternative to using a full message enrichment pattern to add
headers, it provides a concise syntax for querying a sequence or some
other small value into a header.  It is convenient to use outputHeader
and outputType together:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:order.inbox")
    .to("sql:select order_seq.nextval from dual?outputHeader=OrderId&outputType=SelectOne")
    .to("jms:order.booking");
----

== Using StreamList

The producer supports outputType=StreamList
that uses an iterator to stream the output of the query. This allows to
process the data in a streaming fashion which for example can be used by
the Splitter EIP to process each row one at a time,
and load data from the database as needed.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:withSplitModel")
        .to("sql:select * from projects order by id?outputType=StreamList&outputClass=org.apache.camel.component.sql.ProjectModel")
        .to("log:stream")
        .split(body()).streaming()
            .to("log:row")
            .to("mock:result")
        .end();
----
 
[[sql-component-header-values]]
== Header values

When performing `update` operations, the SQL Component stores the update
count in the following message headers:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Header |Description

|`CamelSqlUpdateCount` |The number of rows updated for `update` operations, returned as an
`Integer` object. This header is not provided when using
outputType=StreamList.

|`CamelSqlRowCount` |The number of rows returned for `select` operations, returned as an
`Integer` object. This header is not provided when using
outputType=StreamList.

|`CamelSqlQuery` |Query to execute. This query takes precedence over the
query specified in the endpoint URI. Note that query parameters in the
header _are_ represented by a `?` instead of a `pass:[#]` symbol
|===

When performing `insert` operations, the SQL Component stores the rows
with the generated keys and number of these rows in the following
message headers:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Header |Description

|CamelSqlGeneratedKeysRowCount |The number of rows in the header that contains generated keys.

|CamelSqlGeneratedKeyRows |Rows that contains the generated keys (a list of maps of keys).
|===

== Generated keys

*Since Camel 2.12.4, 2.13.1 and 2.14*

If you insert data using SQL INSERT, then the RDBMS may support auto
generated keys. You can instruct the SQL producer to return the
generated keys in headers. +
 To do that set the header `CamelSqlRetrieveGeneratedKeys=true`. Then
the generated keys will be provided as headers with the keys listed in
the table above.

You can see more details in this
https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=camel.git;a=blob;f=components/camel-sql/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/sql/SqlGeneratedKeysTest.java;h=54c19b7332bb0aa81ee24ff3d3a66885a6b9e9aa;hb=HEAD[unit test].

== DataSource

You can now set a reference to a `DataSource` in the URI directly:

[source,text]
----
sql:select * from table where id=# order by name?dataSource=myDS
----

== Using named parameters

*Since Camel 2.11*

In the given route below, we want to get all the projects from the
projects table. Notice the SQL query has 2 named parameters, :#lic and
:#min. +
 Camel will then lookup for these parameters from the message body or
message headers. Notice in the example above we set two headers with
constant value +
 for the named parameters:

[source,java]
----
   from("direct:projects")
     .setHeader("lic", constant("ASF"))
     .setHeader("min", constant(123))
     .to("sql:select * from projects where license = :#lic and id > :#min order by id")
----

Though if the message body is a `java.util.Map` then the named
parameters will be taken from the body.

[source,java]
----
   from("direct:projects")
     .to("sql:select * from projects where license = :#lic and id > :#min order by id")
----

== Using expression parameters in producers

*Since Camel 2.14*

In the given route below, we want to get all the project from the
database. It uses the body of the exchange for defining the license and
uses the value of a property as the second parameter.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:projects")
  .setBody(constant("ASF"))
  .setProperty("min", constant(123))
  .to("sql:select * from projects where license = :#${body} and id > :#${property.min} order by id")
----

=== Using expression parameters in consumers

*Since Camel 2.23*

When using the SQL component as consumer, you can now also use expression parameters (simple language)
to build dynamic query parameters, such as calling a method on a bean to retrieve an id, date or something.

For example in the sample below we call the nextId method on the bean myIdGenerator:

[source,java]
----
from("sql:select * from projects where id = :#${bean:myIdGenerator.nextId}")
    .to("mock:result");
----

And the bean has the following method:

[source,java]
----
public static class MyIdGenerator {

    private int id = 1;

    public int nextId() {
        return id++;
    }
----

Notice that there is no existing `Exchange` with message body and headers, so
the simple expression you can use in the consumer are most useable for calling
bean methods as in this example.

== Using IN queries with dynamic values

*Since Camel 2.17*

The SQL producer allows to use SQL queries with
IN statements where the IN values is dynamic computed. For example from
the message body or a header etc.

To use IN you need to:

* prefix the parameter name with `in:`
* add `( )` around the parameter

An example explains this better. The following query is used:

[source,sql]
----
-- this is a comment
select *
from projects
where project in (:#in:names)
order by id
----

In the following route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:query")
    .to("sql:classpath:sql/selectProjectsIn.sql")
    .to("log:query")
    .to("mock:query");
----

Then the IN query can use a header with the key names with the dynamic
values such as:

[source,java]
----
// use an array
template.requestBodyAndHeader("direct:query", "Hi there!", "names", new String[]{"Camel", "AMQ"});

// use a list
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
names.add("Camel");
names.add("AMQ");

template.requestBodyAndHeader("direct:query", "Hi there!", "names", names);

// use a string separated values with comma
template.requestBodyAndHeader("direct:query", "Hi there!", "names", "Camel,AMQ");
----

The query can also be specified in the endpoint instead of being
externalized (notice that externalizing makes maintaining the SQL
queries easier)

[source,java]
----
from("direct:query")
    .to("sql:select * from projects where project in (:#in:names) order by id")
    .to("log:query")
    .to("mock:query");
----
 

== Using the JDBC based idempotent repository

*Since Camel 2.7*

In this section we will use the JDBC based
idempotent repository.

[TIP]
====
*Abstract class*

There is an abstract class
`org.apache.camel.processor.idempotent.jdbc.AbstractJdbcMessageIdRepository`
you can extend to build custom JDBC idempotent repository.
====

First we have to create the database table which will be used by the
idempotent repository. We use the following schema:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE CAMEL_MESSAGEPROCESSED ( processorName VARCHAR(255),
messageId VARCHAR(100) )
----
 

We added the createdAt column:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE CAMEL_MESSAGEPROCESSED ( processorName VARCHAR(255),
messageId VARCHAR(100), createdAt TIMESTAMP )
----

WARNING: The SQL Server *TIMESTAMP* type is a fixed-length binary-string type. It
does not map to any of the JDBC time types: *DATE*, *TIME*, or
*TIMESTAMP*.

When working with concurrent consumers it is crucial to create a unique constraint on the columns processorName and messageId.
Because the syntax for this constraint differs from database to database, we do not show it here.

=== Customize the JDBC idempotency repository

You have a few options to tune the
`org.apache.camel.processor.idempotent.jdbc.JdbcMessageIdRepository` for
your needs:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Parameter |Default Value |Description

|createTableIfNotExists |true |Defines whether or not Camel should try to create the table if it
doesn't exist.

|tableExistsString |SELECT 1 FROM CAMEL_MESSAGEPROCESSED WHERE 1 = 0 |This query is used to figure out whether the table already exists or
not. It must throw an exception to indicate the table doesn't exist.

|createString |CREATE TABLE CAMEL_MESSAGEPROCESSED (processorName VARCHAR(255),
messageId VARCHAR(100), createdAt TIMESTAMP) |The statement which is used to create the table.

|queryString |SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CAMEL_MESSAGEPROCESSED WHERE processorName = ? AND
messageId = ? |The query which is used to figure out whether the message already exists
in the repository (the result is not equals to '0'). It takes two
parameters. This first one is the processor name (`String`) and the
second one is the message id (`String`).

|insertString |INSERT INTO CAMEL_MESSAGEPROCESSED (processorName, messageId, createdAt)
VALUES (?, ?, ?) |The statement which is used to add the entry into the table. It takes
three parameter. The first one is the processor name (`String`), the
second one is the message id (`String`) and the third one is the
timestamp (`java.sql.Timestamp`) when this entry was added to the
repository.

|deleteString |DELETE FROM CAMEL_MESSAGEPROCESSED WHERE processorName = ? AND messageId = ? |The statement which is used to delete the entry from the database.
It takes two parameter. This first one is the processor name (`String`) and
the second one is the message id (`String`).
|===

== Using the JDBC based aggregation repository

*Since Camel 2.6*

`JdbcAggregationRepository` is an `AggregationRepository` which on the
fly persists the aggregated messages. This ensures that you will not
loose messages, as the default aggregator will use an in memory only
`AggregationRepository`. The `JdbcAggregationRepository` allows together with Camel to provide
persistent support for the Aggregator.

Only when an Exchange has been successfully
processed it will be marked as complete which happens when the `confirm`
method is invoked on the `AggregationRepository`. This means if the same
Exchange fails again it will be kept retried until
it success.

You can use option `maximumRedeliveries` to limit the maximum number of
redelivery attempts for a given recovered Exchange.
You must also set the `deadLetterUri` option so Camel knows where to
send the Exchange when the `maximumRedeliveries` was
hit.

You can see some examples in the unit tests of camel-sql, for example
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-sql/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/aggregate/jdbc/JdbcAggregateRecoverDeadLetterChannelTest.java[this
test].

=== Database

To be operational, each aggregator uses two table: the aggregation and
completed one. By convention the completed has the same name as the
aggregation one suffixed with `"_COMPLETED"`. The name must be
configured in the Spring bean with the `RepositoryName` property. In the
following example aggregation will be used.

The table structure definition of both table are identical: in both case
a String value is used as key (*id*) whereas a Blob contains the
exchange serialized in byte array. +
 However one difference should be remembered: the *id* field does not
have the same content depending on the table. +
 In the aggregation table *id* holds the correlation Id used by the
component to aggregate the messages. In the completed table, *id* holds
the id of the exchange stored in corresponding the blob field.

Here is the SQL query used to create the tables, just replace
`"aggregation"` with your aggregator repository name.

[source,sql]
-----
CREATE TABLE aggregation (
 id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 exchange blob NOT NULL,
 constraint aggregation_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE aggregation_completed (
 id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 exchange blob NOT NULL,
 constraint aggregation_completed_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
-----


== Storing body and headers as text

*Since Camel 2.11*

You can configure the `JdbcAggregationRepository` to store message body
and select(ed) headers as String in separate columns. For example to
store the body, and the following two headers `companyName` and
`accountName` use the following SQL:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE aggregationRepo3 (
 id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 exchange blob NOT NULL,
 body varchar(1000),
 companyName varchar(1000),
 accountName varchar(1000),
 constraint aggregationRepo3_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE aggregationRepo3_completed (
 id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 exchange blob NOT NULL,
 body varchar(1000),
 companyName varchar(1000),
 accountName varchar(1000),
 constraint aggregationRepo3_completed_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
----
 
And then configure the repository to enable this behavior as shown
below:

[source,xml]
----

=== Codec (Serialization)

Since they can contain any type of payload, Exchanges are not
serializable by design. It is converted into a byte array to be stored
in a database BLOB field. All those conversions are handled by the
`JdbcCodec` class. One detail of the code requires your attention: the
`ClassLoadingAwareObjectInputStream`.

The `ClassLoadingAwareObjectInputStream` has been reused from the
http://activemq.apache.org/[Apache ActiveMQ] project. It wraps an
`ObjectInputStream` and use it with the `ContextClassLoader` rather than
the `currentThread` one. The benefit is to be able to load classes
exposed by other bundles. This allows the exchange body and headers to
have custom types object references.

=== Transaction

A Spring `PlatformTransactionManager` is required to orchestrate
transaction.

==== Service (Start/Stop)

The `start` method verify the connection of the database and the
presence of the required tables. If anything is wrong it will fail
during starting.

=== Aggregator configuration

Depending on the targeted environment, the aggregator might need some
configuration. As you already know, each aggregator should have its own
repository (with the corresponding pair of table created in the
database) and a data source. If the default lobHandler is not adapted to
your database system, it can be injected with the `lobHandler` property.

Here is the declaration for Oracle:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="lobHandler" class="org.springframework.jdbc.support.lob.OracleLobHandler">
  <property name="nativeJdbcExtractor" ref="nativeJdbcExtractor"/>
</bean>
<bean id="nativeJdbcExtractor"
  class="org.springframework.jdbc.support.nativejdbc.CommonsDbcpNativeJdbcExtractor"/>
<bean id="repo"
  class="org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.JdbcAggregationRepository">
  <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>
  <property name="repositoryName" value="aggregation"/>
  <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
  <!-- Only with Oracle, else use default -->
  <property name="lobHandler" ref="lobHandler"/>
</bean>
----

=== Optimistic locking

You can turn on `optimisticLocking` and use
this JDBC based aggregation repository in a clustered environment where
multiple Camel applications shared the same database for the aggregation
repository. If there is a race condition there JDBC driver will throw a
vendor specific exception which the `JdbcAggregationRepository` can
react upon. To know which caused exceptions from the JDBC driver is
regarded as an optimistick locking error we need a mapper to do this.
Therefore there is a
`org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.JdbcOptimisticLockingExceptionMapper`
allows you to implement your custom logic if needed. There is a default
implementation
`org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.DefaultJdbcOptimisticLockingExceptionMapper`
which works as follows:

The following check is done:

* If the caused exception is an `SQLException` then the SQLState is
checked if starts with 23.
* If the caused exception is a `DataIntegrityViolationException`
* If the caused exception class name has "ConstraintViolation" in its
name.
* Optional checking for FQN class name matches if any class names has been
configured.

You can in addition add FQN classnames, and if any of the caused
exception (or any nested) equals any of the FQN class names, then its an
optimistick locking error.

Here is an example, where we define 2 extra FQN class names from the
JDBC vendor.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="repo"
class="org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.JdbcAggregationRepository">
  <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>
  <property name="repositoryName" value="aggregation"/>
  <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
  <property name="jdbcOptimisticLockingExceptionMapper" ref="myExceptionMapper"/>
</bean>
<!-- use the default mapper with extraFQN class names from our JDBC driver -->
<bean id="myExceptionMapper" class="org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.DefaultJdbcOptimisticLockingExceptionMapper">
  <property name="classNames">
    <util:set>
      <value>com.foo.sql.MyViolationExceptoion</value>
      <value>com.foo.sql.MyOtherViolationExceptoion</value>
    </util:set>
  </property>
</bean>

=== Propagation behavior

`JdbcAggregationRepository` uses two distinct _transaction templates_ from Spring-TX. One is read-only
and one is used for read-write operations.

However, when using `JdbcAggregationRepository` within a route that itself uses `<transacted />` and there's
common `PlatformTransactionManager` used, there may be a need to configure _propagation behavior_ used by
transaction templates inside `JdbcAggregationRepository`.

Here's a way to do it:
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="repo"
class="org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.JdbcAggregationRepository">
  <property name="propagationBehaviorName" value="PROPAGATION_NESTED" />
</bean>
----

Propagation is specified by constants of `org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition` interface,
so `propagationBehaviorName` is convenient setter that allows to use names of the constants.

=== PostgreSQL case

There's special database that may cause problems with optimistic locking used by `JdbcAggregationRepository`.
PostgreSQL marks connection as invalid in case of data integrity violation exception (the one with SQLState 23505).
This makes the connection effectively unusable within nested transaction.
Details can be found
https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/200609241203.59292.ralf.wiebicke%40exedio.com[in this document].

`org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.PostgresAggregationRepository` extends `JdbcAggregationRepository` and
uses special `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT ..` statement to provide optimistic locking behavior.

This statement is (with default aggregation table definition):
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO aggregation (id, exchange) values (?, ?) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
----

Details can be found https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-insert.html[in PostgreSQL documentation].

When this clause is used, `java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate()` call returns `0` instead of throwing
SQLException with SQLState=23505. Further handling is exactly the same as with generic `JdbcAggregationRepository`,
but without marking PostgreSQL connection as invalid.

== Camel Sql Starter

A starter module is available to spring-boot users. When using the starter,
the `DataSource` can be directly configured using spring-boot properties.

[source,java]
----
# Example for a mysql datasource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
spring.datasource.username=dbuser
spring.datasource.password=dbpass
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
----

To use this feature, add the following dependencies to your spring boot pom.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-sql-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${camel.version}</version> <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-boot-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

You should also include the specific database driver, if needed.
