== Dropbox Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.14*

The *dropbox:* component allows you to treat
https://www.dropbox.com[Dropbox] remote folders as a producer or
consumer of messages. Using the
http://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-sdk-java/api-docs/v1.7.x/[Dropbox Java
Core API] (reference version for this component is 1.7.x), this camel
component has the following features:

* As a consumer, download files and search files by queries
* As a producer, download files, move files between remote directories,
delete files/dir, upload files and search files by queries

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-dropbox</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

=== URI format

[source]
----
dropbox://[operation]?[options]
----

Where *operation* is the specific action (typically is a CRUD action) to
perform on Dropbox remote folder.

=== Operations

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Operation |Description

|`del` |deletes files or directories on Dropbox

|`get` |download files from Dropbox

|`move` |move files from folders on Dropbox

|`put` |upload files on Dropbox

|`search` |search files on Dropbox based on string queries
|===

*Operations* require additional options to work, some are mandatory for
the specific operation.

=== Options

In order to work with Dropbox API you need to obtain an *accessToken*
and a *clientIdentifier.* +
You can refer to the
https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/start/java[Dropbox
documentation] that explains how to get them.  

// component options: START
The Dropbox component has no options.
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The Dropbox endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
dropbox:operation
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *operation* | *Required* The specific action (typically is a CRUD action) to perform on Dropbox remote folder. |  | DropboxOperation
|===


==== Query Parameters (12 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *accessToken* (common) | *Required* The access token to make API requests for a specific Dropbox user |  | String
| *client* (common) | To use an existing DbxClient instance as DropBox client. |  | DbxClientV2
| *clientIdentifier* (common) | Name of the app registered to make API requests |  | String
| *localPath* (common) | Optional folder or file to upload on Dropbox from the local filesystem. If this option has not been configured then the message body is used as the content to upload. |  | String
| *newRemotePath* (common) | Destination file or folder |  | String
| *query* (common) | A space-separated list of sub-strings to search for. A file matches only if it contains all the sub-strings. If this option is not set, all files will be matched. |  | String
| *remotePath* (common) | Original file or folder to move |  | String
| *uploadMode* (common) | Which mode to upload. in case of add the new file will be renamed if a file with the same name already exists on dropbox. in case of force if a file with the same name already exists on dropbox, this will be overwritten. |  | DropboxUploadMode
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

will upload the file on a remote path equal to the local path. With Windows or without an absolute 
localPath you may run into an exception like the following:
