== Web3j client for Ethereum blockchain Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.22*


The web3j component uses the
https://github.com/web3j/web3j[web3j] client
API and allows you to read/write from geth/parity compatible Ethereum nodes.

=== URI Format

[source,text]
----
web3j://ethereumServerUrl[?options]
----

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

=== Web3j Options
