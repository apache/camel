*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Google Calendar component provides access
to http://google.com/calendar[Google Calendar] via
the https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/[Google
Calendar Web APIs].

Google Calendar uses
the https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2[OAuth 2.0
protocol] for authenticating a Google account and authorizing access to
user data. Before you can use this component, you will need
to https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth[create an
account and generate OAuth credentials]. Credentials comprise of a
clientId, clientSecret, and a refreshToken. A handy resource for
generating a long-lived refreshToken is
the https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground[OAuth playground].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-google-calendar</artifactId>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
        <version>x.x.x</version>

== Component options

// component options: START
The Google Calendar component supports 14 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *applicationName* (common) | Google calendar application name. Example would be camel-google-calendar/1.0 |  | String
| *clientId* (common) | Client ID of the calendar application |  | String
| *configuration* (common) | To use the shared configuration |  | GoogleCalendarConfiguration
| *scopes* (common) | Specifies the level of permissions you want a calendar application to have to a user account. You can separate multiple scopes by comma. See \https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth for more info. | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *clientFactory* (advanced) | To use the GoogleCalendarClientFactory as factory for creating the client. Will by default use BatchGoogleCalendarClientFactory |  | GoogleCalendarClientFactory
| *accessToken* (security) | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. |  | String
| *clientSecret* (security) | Client secret of the calendar application |  | String
| *emailAddress* (security) | The emailAddress of the Google Service Account. |  | String
| *p12FileName* (security) | The name of the p12 file which has the private key to use with the Google Service Account. |  | String
| *refreshToken* (security) | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Calendar component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. |  | String
| *user* (security) | The email address of the user the application is trying to impersonate in the service account flow |  | String
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Google Calendar endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
google-calendar:apiName/methodName

=== Query Parameters (31 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *applicationName* (common) | Google calendar application name. Example would be camel-google-calendar/1.0 |  | String
| *clientId* (common) | Client ID of the calendar application |  | String
| *inBody* (common) | Sets the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body |  | String

| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern

By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
