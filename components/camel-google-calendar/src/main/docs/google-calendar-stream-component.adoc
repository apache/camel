= Google Calendar Stream Component

*Since Camel 2.23*

// HEADER START
*Only consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Google Calendar component provides access
to https://calendar.google.com[Calendar] via
the https://developers.google.com/calendar/overview[Google Calendar
Web APIs].

Google Calendar uses
the https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2[OAuth 2.0
protocol] for authenticating a Google account and authorizing access to
user data. Before you can use this component, you will need
to https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth[create an
account and generate OAuth credentials]. Credentials comprise of a
clientId, clientSecret, and a refreshToken. A handy resource for
generating a long-lived refreshToken is
the https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground[OAuth playground].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

------------------------------------------------------
    <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-google-calendar</artifactId>
            <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
            <version>x.x.x</version>
    </dependency>

== URI Format

The Google Calendar Component uses the following URI format:

--------------------------------------------------------
        google-calendar-stream://index?[options]

== Google Calendar stream component options


// component options: START
The Google Calendar Stream component supports 15 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *accessToken* (consumer) | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. |  | String
| *applicationName* (consumer) | Google Calendar application name. Example would be camel-google-calendar/1.0 |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *calendarId* (consumer) | The calendarId to be used | primary | String
| *clientId* (consumer) | Client ID of the calendar application |  | String
| *clientSecret* (consumer) | Client secret of the calendar application |  | String
| *considerLastUpdate* (consumer) | Take into account the lastUpdate of the last event polled as start date for the next poll | false | boolean
| *consumeFromNow* (consumer) | Consume events in the selected calendar from now on | true | boolean
| *maxResults* (consumer) | Max results to be returned | 10 | int
| *query* (consumer) | The query to execute on calendar |  | String
| *refreshToken* (consumer) | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Calendar component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. |  | String
| *scopes* (consumer) | Specifies the level of permissions you want a calendar application to have to a user account. See \https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth for more info. |  | List
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *clientFactory* (advanced) | The client Factory |  | GoogleCalendarClientFactory
| *configuration* (advanced) | The configuration |  | GoogleCalendarStreamConfiguration

// endpoint options: START
The Google Calendar Stream endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row.

== Consumer

The consumer will poll by default with maxResults equals to 5.

For example

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("google-calendar-stream://test?markAsRead=true&delay=5000&maxResults=5").to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------

This route will consume the next five events starting from the date of polling.
