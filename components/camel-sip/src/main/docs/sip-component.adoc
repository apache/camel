## SIP Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.5*

The *sip* component in Camel is a communication component, based on the
Jain SIP implementation (available under the JCP license).

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an IETF-defined signaling protocol,
widely used for controlling multimedia communication sessions such as
voice and video calls over Internet Protocol (IP).The SIP protocol is an
Application Layer protocol designed to be independent of the underlying
transport layer; it can run on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User
Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

The Jain SIP implementation supports TCP and UDP only.

The Camel SIP component *only* supports the SIP Publish and Subscribe
capability as described in the
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3903.txt[RFC3903 - Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event]

This camel component supports both producer and consumer endpoints.

Camel SIP Producers (Event Publishers) and SIP Consumers (Event
Subscribers) communicate event & state information to each other using
an intermediary entity called a SIP Presence Agent (a stateful brokering
entity).

For SIP based communication, a SIP Stack with a listener *must* be
instantiated on both the SIP Producer and Consumer (using separate ports
if using localhost). This is necessary in order to support the
handshakes & acknowledgements exchanged between the SIP Stacks during
communication.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-sip</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

The URI scheme for a sip endpoint is as follows:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------
sip://johndoe@localhost:99999[?options]
sips://johndoe@localhost:99999/[?options]
-----------------------------------------

This component supports producer and consumer endpoints for both TCP and
UDP.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options

The SIP Component offers an extensive set of configuration options &
capability to create custom stateful headers needed to propagate state
via the SIP protocol.


// component options: START
The SIP component has no options.
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The SIP component is configured using the URI syntax with the following path and query parameters:

    sip:uri

#### 1 path parameters:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,6",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Default | Java Type | Description
| uri |  | URI | *Required* URI of the SIP server to connect to (the username and password can be included such as: john:secretmyserver:9999)
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}

#### 44 query parameters:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description

| transport | common | tcp | String | Setting for choice of transport protocol. Valid choices are tcp or udp.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| consumer | consumer | false | boolean | This setting is used to determine whether the kind of header (FromHeaderToHeader etc) that needs to be created for this endpoint
| presenceAgent | consumer | false | boolean | This setting is used to distinguish between a Presence Agent & a consumer. This is due to the fact that the SIP Camel component ships with a basic Presence Agent (for testing purposes only). Consumers have to set this flag to true.
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.

| sipStack | advanced |  | SipStack | To use a custom SipStack
| sipUri | advanced |  | SipURI | To use a custom SipURI. If none configured then the SipUri fallback to use the options toUser toHost:toPort
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).

### Sending Messages to/from a SIP endpoint

#### Creating a Camel SIP Publisher

In the example below, a SIP Publisher is created to send SIP Event
publications to  +
 a user "agent@localhost:5152". This is the address of the SIP Presence
Agent which acts as a broker between the SIP Publisher and Subscriber

* using a SIP Stack named client
* using a registry based eventHeader called evtHdrName
* using a registry based eventId called evtId
* from a SIP Stack with Listener set up as user2@localhost:3534
* The Event being published is EVENT_A
* A Mandatory Header called REQUEST_METHOD is set to Request.Publish
thereby setting up the endpoint as a Event publisher"

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
producerTemplate.sendBodyAndHeader(  
    "sip://agent@localhost:5152?stackName=client&eventHeaderName=evtHdrName&eventId=evtid&fromUser=user2&fromHost=localhost&fromPort=3534",   
    "EVENT_A",  
    "REQUEST_METHOD",   
    Request.PUBLISH);  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Creating a Camel SIP Subscriber

In the example below, a SIP Subscriber is created to receive SIP Event
publications sent to  +
 a user "johndoe@localhost:5154"

* using a SIP Stack named Subscriber
* registering with a Presence Agent user called agent@localhost:5152
* using a registry based eventHeader called evtHdrName. The evtHdrName
contains the Event which is se to "Event_A"
* using a registry based eventId called evtId

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Override  
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {  
    return new RouteBuilder() {  
        @Override  
        public void configure() throws Exception {    
            // Create PresenceAgent  
            from("sip://agent@localhost:5152?stackName=PresenceAgent&presenceAgent=true&eventHeaderName=evtHdrName&eventId=evtid")  
                .to("mock:neverland");  
                  
            // Create Sip Consumer(Event Subscriber)  
            from("sip://johndoe@localhost:5154?stackName=Subscriber&toUser=agent&toHost=localhost&toPort=5152&eventHeaderName=evtHdrName&eventId=evtid")  
                .to("log:ReceivedEvent?level=DEBUG")  
                .to("mock:notification");  
                  
        }  
    };  
}  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Camel SIP component also ships with a Presence Agent that is meant
to be used for Testing and Demo purposes only.* An example of
instantiating a Presence Agent is given above.

Note that the Presence Agent is set up as a user agent@localhost:5152
and is capable of communicating with both Publisher as well as
Subscriber. It has a separate SIP stackName distinct from Publisher as
well as Subscriber. While it is set up as a Camel Consumer, it does not
actually send any messages along the route to the endpoint
"mock:neverland".
