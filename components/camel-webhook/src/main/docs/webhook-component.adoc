The Webhook meta component allows other Camel components to configure webhooks on a remote webhook provider and
listening for them.

.The following components currently provide webhook endpoints:

- `camel-telegram`
- `camel-whatsapp`

Maven users can add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-webhook</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

Typically, other components that support webhook will bring this dependency transitively.
