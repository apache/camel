= PostgresSQL Event Component
:docTitle: PostgresSQL Event
:artifactId: camel-pgevent
:description: Send and receive PostgreSQL events via LISTEN and NOTIFY commands.
:since: 2.15
:supportLevel: Stable
:component-header: Both producer and consumer are supported

*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

This is a component for Apache Camel which allows for
Producing/Consuming PostgreSQL events related to the LISTEN/NOTIFY
commands added since PostgreSQL 8.3.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-pgevent</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

URI format

The pgevent component uses the following two styles of endpoint URI
notation:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------
pgevent:datasource[?parameters]
pgevent://host:port/database/channel[?parameters]
-------------------------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options


// component options: START
The PostgresSQL Event component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The PostgresSQL Event endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
pgevent:host:port/database/channel
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (4 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* | To connect using hostname and port to the database. | localhost | String
| *port* | To connect using hostname and port to the database. | 5432 | Integer
| *database* | *Required* The database name. The database name can take any characters because it is sent as a quoted identifier. It is part of the endpoint URI, so diacritical marks and non-Latin letters have to be URL encoded. |  | String
| *channel* | *Required* The channel name |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *datasource* (common) | To connect using the given javax.sql.DataSource instead of using hostname and port. |  | DataSource
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *pass* (security) | Password for login |  | String
| *user* (security) | Username for login | postgres | String
