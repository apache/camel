:description: Resource resolver to load files from GitHub
:since: 3.11
:supportLevel: Preview

*Since Camel {since}*

A pluggable resource resolver that allows to load files from github over the internet via `https` protocol.

The syntax is

[source,text]
----
github:organization:repository:branch:filename
----

The default branch is `main` so if you want to load from this branch you can use a shorter syntax

[source,text]
----
github:organization:repository:name
----

For example to load: `https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets/blob/main/aws-ddb-streams-source.kamelet.yaml`

[source,text]
----
github:apache:camel-kamelets:main:aws-ddb-streams-source.kamelet.yaml
----

Because the file is in the main branch we can omit this:

[source,text]
----
github:apache:camel-kamelets:aws-ddb-streams-source.kamelet.yaml
----


IMPORTANT: This resource resolver can potentially load any resources from GitHub that are in public repositories.
It's not recommended for production usage, but is great for development and demo purposes.
