*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Git component allows you to work with a generic Git repository.

*URI Format*

-----------------------------------
git://localRepositoryPath[?options]
-----------------------------------

== URI Options

The producer allows to do operations on a specific repository. +
The consumer allows consuming commits, tags and branches on a specific
repository.


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or
directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END
// component options: START
== Component Options


The Git component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

// component options: END
// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The Git endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
git:localPath
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *localPath* | *Required* Local repository path |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (13 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *branchName* (common) | The branch name to work on |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *type* (consumer) | The consumer type. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: commit, tag, branch |  | GitType
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *allowEmpty* (producer) | The flag to manage empty git commits | true | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to do on the repository. There are 18 enums and the value can be one of: clone, init, add, remove, commit, commitAll, createBranch, deleteBranch, createTag, deleteTag, status, log, push, pull, showBranches, cherryPick, remoteAdd, remoteList |  | String
| *password* (producer) | Remote repository password |  | String
| *remoteName* (producer) | The remote repository name to use in particular operation like pull |  | String
| *remotePath* (producer) | The remote repository path |  | String
| *tagName* (producer) | The tag name to work on |  | String
| *username* (producer) | Remote repository username |  | String

== Message Headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Type |Context |Description

|CamelGitOperation |`null` |String |Producer |The operation to do on a repository, if not specified as endpoint option

|CamelGitFilename |`null` |String |Producer |The file name in an add operation

|CamelGitCommitMessage |`null` |String |Producer |The commit message related in a commit operation

|=======================================================================

== Producer Example

Below is an example route of a producer that add a file test.java to a
local repository, commit it with a specific message on master branch and
then push it to remote repository.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
    .setHeader(GitConstants.GIT_FILE_NAME, constant("test.java"))
    .to("git:///tmp/testRepo?operation=add")
    .setHeader(GitConstants.GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE, constant("first commit"))
    .to("git:///tmp/testRepo?operation=commit")
    .to("git:///tmp/testRepo?operation=push&remotePath=https://foo.com/test/test.git&username=xxx&password=xxx")
    .to("git:///tmp/testRepo?operation=createTag&tagName=myTag")
    .to("git:///tmp/testRepo?operation=pushTag&tagName=myTag&remoteName=origin")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Consumer Example

Below is an example route of a consumer that consumes commit:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
from("git:///tmp/testRepo?type=commit")
    .to(....)
