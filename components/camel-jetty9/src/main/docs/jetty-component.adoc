## Jetty 9 Component

The *jetty* component provides HTTP-based link:endpoint.html[endpoints]
for consuming and producing HTTP requests. That is, the Jetty component
behaves as a simple Web server. +
 Jetty can also be used as a http client which mean you can also use it
with Camel as a producer.

*Stream*

The `assert` call appears in this example, because the code is part of
an unit test.Jetty is stream based, which means the input it receives is
submitted to Camel as a stream. That means you will only be able to read
the content of the stream *once*. +
If you find a situation where the message body appears to be empty or
you need to access the Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE data multiple times
(e.g.: doing multicasting, or redelivery error handling), you should use
link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] or convert the message body to
a `String` which is safe to be re-read multiple times.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jetty</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------
jetty:http://hostname[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
----------------------------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options





// component options: START
The Jetty 9 component supports 31 options which are listed below.

// endpoint options: START
The Jetty 9 component supports 54 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| httpUri | producer |  | URI | *Required* The url of the HTTP endpoint to call.
| chunked | common | true | boolean | If this option is false the Servlet will disable the HTTP streaming and set the content-length header on the response
| disableStreamCache | common | false | boolean | Determines whether or not the raw input stream from Servlet is cached or not (Camel will read the stream into a in memory/overflow to file Stream caching) cache. By default Camel will cache the Servlet input stream to support reading it multiple times to ensure it Camel can retrieve all data from the stream. However you can set this option to true when you for example need to access the raw stream such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. DefaultHttpBinding will copy the request input stream into a stream cache and put it into message body if this option is false to support reading the stream multiple times. If you use Servlet to bridge/proxy an endpoint then consider enabling this option to improve performance in case you do not need to read the message payload multiple times. The http/http4 producer will by default cache the response body stream. If setting this option to true then the producers will not cache the response body stream but use the response stream as-is as the message body.
| enableMultipartFilter | common | false | boolean | Whether Jetty org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.MultiPartFilter is enabled or not. You should set this value to false when bridging endpoints to ensure multipart requests is proxied/bridged as well.
| headerFilterStrategy | common |  | HeaderFilterStrategy | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message.
| httpBinding | common |  | HttpBinding | To use a custom HttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and HttpClient.
| transferException | common | false | boolean | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side and if the caused Exception was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk.
| async | consumer | false | boolean | Configure the consumer to work in async mode
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| continuationTimeout | consumer | 30000 | Long | Allows to set a timeout in millis when using Jetty as consumer (server). By default Jetty uses 30000. You can use a value of = 0 to never expire. If a timeout occurs then the request will be expired and Jetty will return back a http error 503 to the client. This option is only in use when using Jetty with the Asynchronous Routing Engine.
| eagerCheckContentAvailable | consumer | false | boolean | Whether to eager check whether the HTTP requests has content if the content-length header is 0 or not present. This can be turned on in case HTTP clients do not send streamed data.
| enableCORS | consumer | false | boolean | If the option is true Jetty server will setup the CrossOriginFilter which supports the CORS out of box.
| enableJmx | consumer | false | boolean | If this option is true Jetty JMX support will be enabled for this endpoint. See Jetty JMX support for more details.
| httpMethodRestrict | consumer |  | String | Used to only allow consuming if the HttpMethod matches such as GET/POST/PUT etc. Multiple methods can be specified separated by comma.
| matchOnUriPrefix | consumer | false | boolean | Whether or not the consumer should try to find a target consumer by matching the URI prefix if no exact match is found.

| responseBufferSize | consumer |  | Integer | To use a custom buffer size on the javax.servlet.ServletResponse.
| sendDateHeader | consumer | false | boolean | If the option is true jetty server will send the date header to the client which sends the request. NOTE please make sure there is no any other camel-jetty endpoint is share the same port otherwise this option may not work as expected.
| sendServerVersion | consumer | true | boolean | If the option is true jetty will send the server header with the jetty version information to the client which sends the request. NOTE please make sure there is no any other camel-jetty endpoint is share the same port otherwise this option may not work as expected.
| sessionSupport | consumer | false | boolean | Specifies whether to enable the session manager on the server side of Jetty.
| traceEnabled | consumer | false | boolean | Specifies whether to enable HTTP TRACE for this Servlet consumer. By default TRACE is turned off.
| useContinuation | consumer |  | Boolean | Whether or not to use Jetty continuations for the Jetty Server.
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use.

| handlers | consumer (advanced) |  | String | Specifies a comma-delimited set of Handler instances to lookup in your Registry. These handlers are added to the Jetty servlet context (for example to add security). Important: You can not use different handlers with different Jetty endpoints using the same port number. The handlers is associated to the port number. If you need different handlers then use different port numbers.
| httpBindingRef | consumer (advanced) |  | String | Option to disable throwing the HttpOperationFailedException in case of failed responses from the remote server. This allows you to get all responses regardless of the HTTP status code.
| multipartFilter | consumer (advanced) |  | Filter | Allows using a custom multipart filter. Note: setting multipartFilterRef forces the value of enableMultipartFilter to true.
| multipartFilterRef | consumer (advanced) |  | String | Allows using a custom multipart filter. Note: setting multipartFilterRef forces the value of enableMultipartFilter to true.
| authMethodPriority | producer |  | String | Authentication method for proxy either as Basic Digest or NTLM.
| bridgeEndpoint | producer | false | boolean | If the option is true HttpProducer will ignore the Exchange.HTTP_URI header and use the endpoint's URI for request. You may also set the option throwExceptionOnFailure to be false to let the HttpProducer send all the fault response back.
| connectionClose | producer | false | boolean | Specifies whether a Connection Close header must be added to HTTP Request. By default connectionClose is false.
| cookieHandler | producer |  | CookieHandler | Configure a cookie handler to maintain a HTTP session
| copyHeaders | producer | true | boolean | If this option is true then IN exchange headers will be copied to OUT exchange headers according to copy strategy. Setting this to false allows to only include the headers from the HTTP response (not propagating IN headers).
| httpClientMaxThreads | producer | 254 | Integer | To set a value for maximum number of threads in HttpClient thread pool. This setting override any setting configured on component level. Notice that both a min and max size must be configured. If not set it default to max 254 threads used in Jettys thread pool.
| httpClientMinThreads | producer | 8 | Integer | To set a value for minimum number of threads in HttpClient thread pool. This setting override any setting configured on component level. Notice that both a min and max size must be configured. If not set it default to min 8 threads used in Jettys thread pool.
| ignoreResponseBody | producer | false | boolean | If this option is true The http producer won't read response body and cache the input stream
| okStatusCodeRange | producer | 200-299 | String | The status codes which is considered a success response. The values are inclusive. The range must be defined as from-to with the dash included.
| preserveHostHeader | producer | false | boolean | If the option is true HttpProducer will set the Host header to the value contained in the current exchange Host header useful in reverse proxy applications where you want the Host header received by the downstream server to reflect the URL called by the upstream client this allows applications which use the Host header to generate accurate URL's for a proxied service
| proxyHost | producer |  | String | The proxy host name
| proxyPort | producer |  | int | The proxy port number
| throwExceptionOnFailure | producer | true | boolean | Option to disable throwing the HttpOperationFailedException in case of failed responses from the remote server. This allows you to get all responses regardless of the HTTP status code.
| httpClient | producer (advanced) |  | HttpClient | Sets a shared HttpClient to use for all producers created by this endpoint. By default each producer will use a new http client and not share. Important: Make sure to handle the lifecycle of the shared client such as stopping the client when it is no longer in use. Camel will call the start method on the client to ensure its started when this endpoint creates a producer. This options should only be used in special circumstances.
| httpClientParameters | producer (advanced) |  | Map | Configuration of Jetty's HttpClient. For example setting httpClient.idleTimeout=30000 sets the idle timeout to 30 seconds. And httpClient.timeout=30000 sets the request timeout to 30 seconds in case you want to timeout sooner if you have long running request/response calls.
| jettyBinding | producer (advanced) |  | JettyHttpBinding | To use a custom JettyHttpBinding which be used to customize how a response should be written for the producer.
| jettyBindingRef | producer (advanced) |  | String | To use a custom JettyHttpBinding which be used to customize how a response should be written for the producer.
| urlRewrite | producer (advanced) |  | UrlRewrite | Refers to a custom org.apache.camel.component.http.UrlRewrite which allows you to rewrite urls when you bridge/proxy endpoints. See more details at http://camel.apache.org/urlrewrite.html
| mapHttpMessageBody | advanced | true | boolean | If this option is true then IN exchange Body of the exchange will be mapped to HTTP body. Setting this to false will avoid the HTTP mapping.

### Message Headers

Camel uses the same message headers as the link:http.html[HTTP]
component. 
From Camel 2.2, it also uses (Exchange.HTTP_CHUNKED,CamelHttpChunked)
header to turn on or turn off the chuched encoding on the camel-jetty
consumer.

Camel also populates *all* request.parameter and request.headers. For
example, given a client request with the URL,
`http://myserver/myserver?orderid=123`, the exchange will contain a
header named `orderid` with the value 123.

Starting with Camel 2.2.0, you can get the request.parameter from the
message header not only from Get Method, but also other HTTP method.

### Usage

The Jetty component supports both consumer and producer endpoints.
Another option for producing to other HTTP endpoints, is to use the
link:http.html[HTTP Component]

### Producer Example

The following is a basic example of how to send an HTTP request to an
existing HTTP endpoint.

in Java DSL

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start").to("jetty://http://www.google.com");
---------------------------------------------------------

or in Spring XML

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="jetty://http://www.google.com"/>
<route>
---------------------------------------------

### Consumer Example

In this sample we define a route that exposes a HTTP service at
`http://localhost:8080/myapp/myservice`:

*Usage of localhost*

When you specify `localhost` in a URL, Camel exposes the endpoint only
on the local TCP/IP network interface, so it cannot be accessed from
outside the machine it operates on.

If you need to expose a Jetty endpoint on a specific network interface,
the numerical IP address of this interface should be used as the host.
If you need to expose a Jetty endpoint on all network interfaces, the
`0.0.0.0` address should be used.

To listen across an entire URI prefix, see
link:how-do-i-let-jetty-match-wildcards.html[How do I let Jetty match
wildcards].

If you actually want to expose routes by HTTP and already have a
Servlet, you should instead refer to the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=46339[Servlet
Transport].

Our business logic is implemented in the `MyBookService` class, which
accesses the HTTP request contents and then returns a response. +
 *Note:* The `assert` call appears in this example, because the code is
part of an unit test.

The following sample shows a content-based route that routes all
requests containing the URI parameter, `one`, to the endpoint,
`mock:one`, and all others to `mock:other`.

So if a client sends the HTTP request, `http://serverUri?one=hello`, the
Jetty component will copy the HTTP request parameter, `one` to the
exchange's `in.header`. We can then use the `simple` language to route
exchanges that contain this header to a specific endpoint and all others
to another. If we used a language more powerful than
link:simple.html[Simple] (such as link:el.html[EL] or
link:ognl.html[OGNL]) we could also test for the parameter value and do
routing based on the header value as well.

### Session Support

The session support option, `sessionSupport`, can be used to enable a
`HttpSession` object and access the session object while processing the
exchange. For example, the following route enables sessions:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="jetty:http://0.0.0.0/myapp/myservice/?sessionSupport=true"/>
    <processRef ref="myCode"/>
<route>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `myCode` link:processor.html[Processor] can be instantiated by a
Spring `bean` element:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="myCode"class="com.mycompany.MyCodeProcessor"/>
--------------------------------------------------------

Where the processor implementation can access the `HttpSession` as
follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    HttpSession session = exchange.getIn(HttpMessage.class).getRequest().getSession();
    ...
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SSL Support (HTTPS)

[[Jetty-UsingtheJSSEConfigurationUtility]]
Using the JSSE Configuration Utility

As of Camel 2.8, the Jetty component supports SSL/TLS configuration
through the link:camel-configuration-utilities.html[Camel JSSE
Configuration Utility].  This utility greatly decreases the amount of
component specific code you need to write and is configurable at the
endpoint and component levels.  The following examples demonstrate how
to use the utility with the Jetty component.

[[Jetty-Programmaticconfigurationofthecomponent]]
Programmatic configuration of the component

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyStoreParameters ksp = new KeyStoreParameters();
ksp.setResource("/users/home/server/keystore.jks");
ksp.setPassword("keystorePassword");

KeyManagersParameters kmp = new KeyManagersParameters();
kmp.setKeyStore(ksp);
kmp.setKeyPassword("keyPassword");

SSLContextParameters scp = new SSLContextParameters();
scp.setKeyManagers(kmp);

  </camel:sslContextParameters>...
...
  <to uri="jetty:https://127.0.0.1/mail/?sslContextParametersRef=sslContextParameters"/>
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Jetty-ConfiguringJettyDirectly]]
Configuring Jetty Directly

Jetty provides SSL support out of the box. To enable Jetty to run in SSL
mode, simply format the URI with the `https://` prefix---for example:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------
<from uri="jetty:https://0.0.0.0/myapp/myservice/"/>
----------------------------------------------------

Jetty also needs to know where to load your keystore from and what
passwords to use in order to load the correct SSL certificate. Set the
following JVM System Properties:

*until Camel 2.2*

* `jetty.ssl.keystore` specifies the location of the Java keystore file,
which contains the Jetty server's own X.509 certificate in a _key
entry_. A key entry stores the X.509 certificate (effectively, the
_public key_) and also its associated private key.
* `jetty.ssl.password` the store password, which is required to access
the keystore file (this is the same password that is supplied to the
`keystore` command's `-storepass` option).
* `jetty.ssl.keypassword` the key password, which is used to access the
certificate's key entry in the keystore (this is the same password that
is supplied to the `keystore` command's `-keypass` option).

*from Camel 2.3 onwards*

* `org.eclipse.jetty.ssl.keystore` specifies the location of the Java
keystore file, which contains the Jetty server's own X.509 certificate
in a _key entry_. A key entry stores the X.509 certificate (effectively,
the _public key_) and also its associated private key.
* `org.eclipse.jetty.ssl.password` the store password, which is required
to access the keystore file (this is the same password that is supplied
to the `keystore` command's `-storepass` option).
* `org.eclipse.jetty.ssl.keypassword` the key password, which is used to
access the certificate's key entry in the keystore (this is the same
password that is supplied to the `keystore` command's `-keypass`
option).

For details of how to configure SSL on a Jetty endpoint, read the
following documentation at the Jetty Site:
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+configure+SSL[http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+configure+SSL]

Some SSL properties aren't exposed directly by Camel, however Camel does
expose the underlying SslSocketConnector, which will allow you to set
properties like needClientAuth for mutual authentication requiring a
client certificate or wantClientAuth for mutual authentication where a
client doesn't need a certificate but can have one. There's a slight
difference between the various Camel versions:

*Up to Camel 2.2*

The value you use as keys in the above map is the port you configure
Jetty to listen on.

#### Configuring general SSL properties

*Available as of Camel 2.5*

Instead of a per port number specific SSL socket connector (as shown
above) you can now configure general properties which applies for all
SSL socket connectors (which is not explicit configured as above with
the port number as entry).

            <entry key="needClientAuth"value="..."/>
            <entry key="truststore"value="..."/>
        </map>
    </property>

#### How to obtain reference to the X509Certificate

Jetty stores a reference to the certificate in the HttpServletRequest
which you can access from code as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HttpServletRequest req = exchange.getIn().getBody(HttpServletRequest.class);
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate) req.getAttribute("javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Configuring general HTTP properties

*Available as of Camel 2.5*

Instead of a per port number specific HTTP socket connector (as shown
above) you can now configure general properties which applies for all
HTTP socket connectors (which is not explicit configured as above with
the port number as entry).

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="jetty" class="org.apache.camel.component.jetty.JettyHttpComponent">
    <property name="socketConnectorProperties">
        <map>
            <entry key="acceptors" value="4"/>
            <entry key="maxIdleTime" value="300000"/>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Obtaining X-Forwarded-For header with HttpServletRequest.getRemoteAddr()

If the HTTP requests are handled by an Apache server and forwarded to
jetty with mod_proxy, the original client IP address is in the
X-Forwarded-For header and the HttpServletRequest.getRemoteAddr() will
return the address of the Apache proxy.

Jetty has a forwarded property which takes the value from
X-Forwarded-For and places it in the HttpServletRequest remoteAddr
property.  This property is not available directly through the endpoint
configuration but it can be easily added using the socketConnectors
property:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="jetty" class="org.apache.camel.component.jetty.JettyHttpComponent">
    <property name="socketConnectors">
        <map>
            <entry key="8080">
                <bean class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.nio.SelectChannelConnector">
                    <property name="forwarded" value="true"/>
                </bean>
            </entry>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is particularly useful when an existing Apache server handles TLS
connections for a domain and proxies them to application servers
internally.

### Default behavior for returning HTTP status codes

The default behavior of HTTP status codes is defined by the
`org.apache.camel.component.http.DefaultHttpBinding` class, which
handles how a response is written and also sets the HTTP status code.

If the exchange was processed successfully, the 200 HTTP status code is
returned. +
 If the exchange failed with an exception, the 500 HTTP status code is
returned, and the stacktrace is returned in the body. If you want to
specify which HTTP status code to return, set the code in the
`Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE` header of the OUT message.

### Customizing HttpBinding

By default, Camel uses the
`org.apache.camel.component.http.DefaultHttpBinding` to handle how a
response is written. If you like, you can customize this behavior either
by implementing your own `HttpBinding` class or by extending
`DefaultHttpBinding` and overriding the appropriate methods.

The following example shows how to customize the `DefaultHttpBinding` in
order to change how exceptions are returned:

We can then create an instance of our binding and register it in the
Spring registry as follows:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="mybinding"class="com.mycompany.MyHttpBinding"/>
---------------------------------------------------------

And then we can reference this binding when we define the route:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route><from uri="jetty:http://0.0.0.0:8080/myapp/myservice?httpBindingRef=mybinding"/><to uri="bean:doSomething"/></route>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Jetty handlers and security configuration

You can configure a list of Jetty handlers on the endpoint, which can be
useful for enabling advanced Jetty security features. These handlers are
configured in Spring XML as follows:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<-- Jetty Security handling -->
<bean id="userRealm" class="org.mortbay.jetty.plus.jaas.JAASUserRealm">
    <property name="name" value="tracker-users"/>
    <property name="loginModuleName" value="ldaploginmodule"/>
</bean>

<bean id="constraint" class="org.mortbay.jetty.security.Constraint">
    <property name="name" value="BASIC"/>
    <property name="roles" value="tracker-users"/>
    <property name="authenticate" value="true"/>
</bean>

<bean id="constraintMapping" class="org.mortbay.jetty.security.ConstraintMapping">
    <property name="constraint" ref="constraint"/>
    <property name="pathSpec" value="/*"/>
</bean>

<bean id="securityHandler" class="org.mortbay.jetty.security.SecurityHandler">
    <property name="userRealm" ref="userRealm"/>
    <property name="constraintMappings" ref="constraintMapping"/>
</bean>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*And from Camel 2.3 onwards* you can configure a list of Jetty handlers
as follows:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<-- Jetty Security handling -->
<bean id="constraint" class="org.eclipse.jetty.http.security.Constraint">
    <property name="name" value="BASIC"/>
    <property name="roles" value="tracker-users"/>
    <property name="authenticate" value="true"/>
</bean>

<bean id="constraintMapping" class="org.eclipse.jetty.security.ConstraintMapping">
    <property name="constraint" ref="constraint"/>
    <property name="pathSpec" value="/*"/>
</bean>

<bean id="securityHandler" class="org.eclipse.jetty.security.ConstraintSecurityHandler">
    <property name="authenticator">
        <bean class="org.eclipse.jetty.security.authentication.BasicAuthenticator"/>
    </property>
    <property name="constraintMappings">
        <list>
            <ref bean="constraintMapping"/>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then define the endpoint as:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jetty:http://0.0.0.0:9080/myservice?handlers=securityHandler")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need more handlers, set the `handlers` option equal to a
comma-separated list of bean IDs.

### How to return a custom HTTP 500 reply message

You may want to return a custom reply message when something goes wrong,
instead of the default reply message Camel link:jetty.html[Jetty]
replies with. +
 You could use a custom `HttpBinding` to be in control of the message
mapping, but often it may be easier to use Camel's
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] to construct the custom
reply message. For example as show here, where we return
`Dude something went wrong` with HTTP error code 500:

### Multi-part Form support

From Camel 2.3.0, camel-jetty support to multipart form post out of box.
The submitted form-data are mapped into the message header. Camel-jetty
creates an attachment for each uploaded file. The file name is mapped to
the name of the attachment. The content type is set as the content type
of the attachment file name. You can find the example here.

*Note: getName() functions as shown below in versions 2.5 and higher. In
earlier versions you receive the temporary file name for the attachment
instead*

### Jetty JMX support

From Camel 2.3.0, camel-jetty supports the enabling of Jetty's JMX
capabilities at the component and endpoint level with the endpoint
configuration taking priority. Note that JMX must be enabled within the
Camel context in order to enable JMX support in this component as the
component provides Jetty with a reference to the MBeanServer registered
with the Camel context. Because the camel-jetty component caches and
reuses Jetty resources for a given protocol/host/port pairing, this
configuration option will only be evaluated during the creation of the
first endpoint to use a protocol/host/port pairing. For example, given
two routes created from the following XML fragments, JMX support would
remain enabled for all endpoints listening on "https://0.0.0.0".

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
<from uri="jetty:https://0.0.0.0/myapp/myservice1/?enableJmx=true"/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<from uri="jetty:https://0.0.0.0/myapp/myservice2/?enableJmx=false"/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The camel-jetty component also provides for direct configuration of the
Jetty MBeanContainer. Jetty creates MBean names dynamically. If you are
running another instance of Jetty outside of the Camel context and
sharing the same MBeanServer between the instances, you can provide both
instances with a reference to the same MBeanContainer in order to avoid
name collisions when registering Jetty MBeans.
