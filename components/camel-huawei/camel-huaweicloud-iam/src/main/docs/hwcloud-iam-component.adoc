*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

Huawei Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) component allows you to integrate with https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/product/iam.html[IAM] provided by Huawei Cloud.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-huaweicloud-iam</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== URI Options

// component options: START
The IAM component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The HuaweiCloud IAM endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
hwcloud-iam:operation
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *operation* | *Required* Operation to be performed |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (14 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *endpoint* (producer) | IAM url. Carries higher precedence than region parameter based client initialization |  | String
| *groupId* (producer) | Group ID to perform operation with |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *region* (producer) | *Required* IAM service region. This is lower precedence than endpoint based configuration |  | String
| *serviceKeys* (producer) | Configuration object for cloud service authentication |  | ServiceKeys
| *proxyHost* (proxy) | Proxy server ip/hostname |  | String
| *proxyPassword* (proxy) | Proxy authentication password |  | String
| *proxyPort* (proxy) | Proxy server port |  | int
| *proxyUser* (proxy) | Proxy authentication user |  | String
| *authenticationKey* (security) | *Required* Authentication key for the cloud user |  | String
| *ignoreSslVerification* (security) | Ignore SSL verification | false | boolean
| *secretKey* (security) | *Required* Secret key for the cloud user |  | String
| *userId* (producer) | User ID to perform operation with |  | String
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Usage

=== Message properties evaluated by the IAM producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelHwCloudIamOperation` |`String` | Name of operation to invoke

|`CamelHwCloudIamUserId` |`String` | User ID to invoke operation on

|`CamelHwCloudIamGroupId` |`String` | Group ID to invoke operation on

|=======================================================================

If any of the above properties are set, they will override their corresponding query parameter.

== List of Supported IAM Operations

- listUsers
- getUsers
- listGroups
- getGroupUsers

== Using ServiceKey Configuration Bean

Authentication key and secret keys are required to authenticate against cloud IAM service. You can avoid having them being exposed
and scattered over in your endpoint uri by wrapping them inside a bean of class `org.apache.camel.component.huaweicloud.iam.models.ServiceKeys`.
Add it to the registry and let Camel look it up by referring the object via endpoint query parameter `serviceKeys`.

Check the following code snippets:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myServiceKeyConfig" class="org.apache.camel.component.huaweicloud.iam.models.ServiceKeys">
   <property name="authenticationKey" value="your_authentication_key" />
   <property name="secretKey" value="your_secret_key" />
</bean>
----
[source,java]
----
from("direct:triggerRoute")
 .setProperty(IAMPropeties.OPERATION, constant("listUsers"))
 .setProperty(IAMPropeties.USER_ID ,constant("your_user_id"))
 .setProperty(IAMPropeties.GROUP_ID, constant("your_group_id))
 .to("hwcloud-iam:listUsers?region=cn-north-4&serviceKeys=#myServiceKeyConfig")
