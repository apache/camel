## OpenShift Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.14*

The *openshift* component is a component for managing your
https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift] applications. 

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-openshift</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
----------------------------
openshift:clientId[?options]
----------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options



// component options: START
The OpenShift component supports 5 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]

| password | security |  | String | The password for login to openshift server.
| domain | common |  | String | Domain name. If not specified then the default domain is used.
| server | common |  | String | Url to the openshift server. If not specified then the default value from the local openshift configuration file /.openshift/express.conf is used. And if that fails as well then openshift.redhat.com is used.
| resolvePropertyPlaceholders | common | true | boolean | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders.
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}

// endpoint options: START
The OpenShift component is configured using the URI syntax with the following path and query parameters:

#### 26 query parameters:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| domain | common |  | String | Domain name. If not specified then the default domain is used.
| password | common |  | String | *Required* The password for login to openshift server.
| server | common |  | String | Url to the openshift server. If not specified then the default value from the local openshift configuration file /.openshift/express.conf is used. And if that fails as well then openshift.redhat.com is used.
| username | common |  | String | *Required* The username to login to openshift server.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle | consumer | false | boolean | If the polling consumer did not poll any files you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead.
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.
| pollStrategy | consumer (advanced) |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel.
| application | producer |  | String | The application name to start stop restart or get the state.
| mode | producer |  | String | Whether to output the message body as a pojo or json. For pojo the message is a List type.
| operation | producer |  | String | The operation to perform which can be: list start stop restart and state. The list operation returns information about all the applications in json format. The state operation returns the state such as: started stopped etc. The other operations does not return any value.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
| backoffErrorThreshold | scheduler |  | int | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
| backoffIdleThreshold | scheduler |  | int | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
| backoffMultiplier | scheduler |  | int | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured.
| delay | scheduler | 500 | long | Milliseconds before the next poll. You can also specify time values using units such as 60s (60 seconds) 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds) and 1h (1 hour).
| greedy | scheduler | false | boolean | If greedy is enabled then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if the previous run polled 1 or more messages.
| initialDelay | scheduler | 1000 | long | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. You can also specify time values using units such as 60s (60 seconds) 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds) and 1h (1 hour).
| runLoggingLevel | scheduler | TRACE | LoggingLevel | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that.
| scheduledExecutorService | scheduler |  | ScheduledExecutorService | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool.
| scheduler | scheduler | none | ScheduledPollConsumerScheduler | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz2 component
| schedulerProperties | scheduler |  | Map | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz2 Spring based scheduler.
| startScheduler | scheduler | true | boolean | Whether the scheduler should be auto started.
| timeUnit | scheduler | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options.
| useFixedDelay | scheduler | true | boolean | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details.

### Examples

#### Listing all applications

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
// sending route
from("direct:apps")
    .to("openshift:myClient?username=foo&password=secret&operation=list");
    .to("log:apps");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case the information about all the applications is returned as
pojo. If you want a json response, then set mode=json.

#### Stopping an application

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// stopping the foobar application
from("direct:control")
    .to("openshift:myClient?username=foo&password=secret&operation=stop&application=foobar");
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the example above we stop the application named foobar.

 

Polling for gear state changes

The consumer is used for polling state changes in gears. Such as when a
new gear is added/removed/ or its lifecycle is changed, eg started, or
stopped etc.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// trigger when state changes on our gears
from("openshift:myClient?username=foo&password=secret&delay=30s")
    .log("Event ${header.CamelOpenShiftEventType} on application ${body.name} changed state to ${header.CamelOpenShiftEventNewState}");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

When the consumer emits an Exchange then the body contains
the `com.openshift.client.IApplication` as the message body. And the
following headers is included.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |May be null |Description

|CamelOpenShiftEventType |No |The type of the event which can be one of: added, removed or changed.

|CamelOpenShiftEventOldState |Yes |The old state, when the event type is changed.

|CamelOpenShiftEventNewState |No |The new state, for any of the event types
