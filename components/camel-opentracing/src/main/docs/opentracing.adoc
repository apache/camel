*Since Camel {since}*

The OpenTracing component is used for tracing and timing incoming and
outgoing Camel messages using http://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing].

Events (spans) are captured for incoming and outgoing messages being sent
to/from Camel.

See the http://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] website for a list of supported tracers.

== Configuration

The configuration properties for the OpenTracing tracer are:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Default |Description

|excludePatterns |  | Sets exclude pattern(s) that will disable tracing for Camel
messages that matches the pattern. The content is a Set<String> where the key is a pattern. The pattern
uses the rules from Intercept.
|encoding |false| Sets whether the header keys need to be encoded (connector specific) or not. The value is a boolean.
Dashes need for instances to be encoded for JMS property keys.
|setTracingStrategy | NoopTracingStrategy | Allows a custom Camel `InterceptStrategy` to be provided in order to
augment the default Spans with data from each processor in a route. `OpenTracingTracingStrategy` will create spans for each
processor, except for Camel log and OpenTracing processors, and activate a Scope in order to enable third-party instrumentation
in processors through the default ScopeManager. Processor spans can be excluded through the exludePatterns set, these
will be matched using the processor's ID.

|=======================================================================

There are three ways in which an OpenTracing tracer can be configured to provide distributed tracing for a Camel application:

=== Explicit

Include the `camel-opentracing` component in your POM, along with any specific dependencies associated with the chosen OpenTracing compliant Tracer.

To explicitly configure OpenTracing support, instantiate the `OpenTracingTracer` and initialize the camel
context. You can optionally specify a `Tracer`, or alternatively it can be implicitly discovered using the
`Registry` or `ServiceLoader`.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenTracingTracer ottracer = new OpenTracingTracer();
// By default it uses a Noop Tracer, but you can override it with a specific OpenTracing implementation.
ottracer.setTracer(...);
// And then initialize the context
ottracer.init(camelContext);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use OpenTracingTracer in XML, all you need to do is to define the
OpenTracing tracer beans. Camel will automatically discover and use them.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bean id="tracer" class="..."/>
  <bean id="ottracer" class="org.apache.camel.opentracing.OpenTracingTracer">
    <property name="tracer" ref="tracer"/>
  </bean>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Spring Boot

If you are using Spring Boot then you can add
the `camel-opentracing-starter` dependency, and turn on OpenTracing by annotating
the main class with `@CamelOpenTracing`.

The `Tracer` will be implicitly obtained from the camel context's `Registry`, or the `ServiceLoader`, unless
a `Tracer` bean has been defined by the application.

== Java Agent

The third approach is to use a Java Agent to automatically configure the OpenTracing support.

Include the `camel-opentracing` component in your POM, along with any specific dependencies associated with the chosen OpenTracing compliant Tracer.

The OpenTracing Java Agent is associated with the following dependency:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.opentracing.contrib</groupId>
      <artifactId>opentracing-specialagent</artifactId>
    </dependency>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: It is necessary to use an OpenTracing compliant tracer that is
compatible with OpenTracing Java API version 0.31 or higher.

The `Tracer` used will be implicitly loaded from the camel context `Registry` or using the `ServiceLoader`.

How this agent is used will be specific to how you execute your application. _Service2_ in the https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples/tree/main/opentracing[Opentracing Spring Boot example] downloads the agent into a local folder and then uses the `exec-maven-plugin` to launch the service with the `-javaagent` command line option.

== Example

You can find an example demonstrating the three ways to configure OpenTracing here:
https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot-examples/tree/main/opentracing[camel-spring-boot-examples/opentracing]

== Span Operations Processors

The OpenTracing Component exposes the Java API span operations as a set of Processors: `TagProcessor`, `SetBaggageProcessor`, and `GetBaggageProcessor`.

=== Example

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("seda:a").routeId("a")
        .process(new SetBaggageProcessor("a-baggage", simple("${header.request-header}")))
        .to("seda:b")
        .to("seda:c");

from("seda:b").routeId("b")
        .process(new TagProcessor("b-tag", simple("${header.request-header}")));

from("seda:c").routeId("c")
        .process(new GetBaggageProcessor("a-baggage", "baggage-header"));
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where the value of header "request-header" is "foo", the resulting trace from executing route "seda:a" would include:

* Span "a" with a baggage item named "a-baggage" of value "foo"
* Span "b" with a tag named "b-tag" of value "foo"

and the resulting message would contain:

* Header "baggage-header" of value "foo"

== MDC Logging
When MDC Logging is enabled for the active Camel context the Trace ID and Span ID will be added and removed from the MDC for each route or processor (depending on the tracing strategy configured), the keys are `trace_id` and `span_id`, respectively.

If the `OpenTracingTracingStrategy` is enabled the span ID will be the one for the current processor that logs an entry, otherwise it will be the one for the current route.
