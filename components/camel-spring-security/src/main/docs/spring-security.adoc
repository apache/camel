Spring Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.3*

The *camel-spring-security* component provides role-based authorization
for Camel routes. It leverages the authentication and user services
provided by
http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/index.html[Spring
Security] (formerly Acegi Security) and adds a declarative, role-based
policy system to control whether a route can be executed by a given
principal.

If you are not familiar with the Spring Security authentication and
authorization system, please review the current reference documentation
on the SpringSource web site linked above.

[[SpringSecurity-Creatingauthorizationpolicies]]
Creating authorization policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Access to a route is controlled by an instance of a
`SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy` object. A policy object contains the
name of the Spring Security authority (role) required to run a set of
endpoints and references to Spring Security `AuthenticationManager` and
`AccessDecisionManager` objects used to determine whether the current
principal has been assigned that role. Policy objects may be configured
as Spring beans or by using an `<authorizationPolicy>` element in Spring
XML.

The `<authorizationPolicy>` element may contain the following
attributes:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Description

|`id` |`null` |The unique Spring bean identifier which is used to reference the policy
in routes (required)

|`access` |`null` |The Spring Security authority name that is passed to the access decision
manager (required)

|`authenticationManager` |`authenticationManager` |The name of the Spring Security `AuthenticationManager` object in the
context

|`accessDecisionManager` |`accessDecisionManager` |The name of the Spring Security `AccessDecisionManager` object in the
context

|`authenticationAdapter` |DefaultAuthenticationAdapter |*Camel 2.4* The name of a *camel-spring-security*
`AuthenticationAdapter` object in the context that is used to convert a
`javax.security.auth.Subject` into a Spring Security `Authentication`
instance.

|`useThreadSecurityContext` |`true` |If a `javax.security.auth.Subject` cannot be found in the In message
header under Exchange.AUTHENTICATION, check the Spring Security
`SecurityContextHolder` for an `Authentication` object.

|`alwaysReauthenticate` |`false` |If set to true, the `SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy` will always call
`AuthenticationManager.authenticate()` each time the policy is accessed.
|=======================================================================

[[SpringSecurity-ControllingaccesstoCamelroutes]]
Controlling access to Camel routes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Spring Security `AuthenticationManager` and `AccessDecisionManager`
are required to use this component. Here is an example of how to
configure these objects in Spring XML using the Spring Security
namespace:

Now that the underlying security objects are set up, we can use them to
configure an authorization policy and use that policy to control access
to a route:

In this example, the endpoint `mock:end` will not be executed unless a
Spring Security `Authentication` object that has been or can be
authenticated and contains the `ROLE_ADMIN` authority can be located by
the _admin_ `SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy`.

[[SpringSecurity-Authentication]]
Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The process of obtaining security credentials that are used for
authorization is not specified by this component. You can write your own
processors or components which get authentication information from the
exchange depending on your needs. For example, you might create a
processor that gets credentials from an HTTP request header originating
in the <<jetty-component,Jetty>> component. No matter how the credentials
are collected, they need to be placed in the In message or the
`SecurityContextHolder` so the Camel link:spring-security.html[Spring
Security] component can access them:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import javax.security.auth.Subject;
import org.apache.camel.*;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.*;


public class MyAuthService implements Processor {
    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
        // get the username and password from the HTTP header
        // http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication
        String userpass = new String(Base64.decodeBase64(exchange.getIn().getHeader("Authorization", String.class)));
        String[] tokens = userpass.split(":");
        
        // create an Authentication object
        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(tokens[0], tokens[1]);

        // wrap it in a Subject
        Subject subject = new Subject();
        subject.getPrincipals().add(authToken);

        // place the Subject in the In message
        exchange.getIn().setHeader(Exchange.AUTHENTICATION, subject);

        // you could also do this if useThreadSecurityContext is set to true
        // SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy` will automatically authenticate
the `Authentication` object if necessary.

There are two issues to be aware of when using the
`SecurityContextHolder` instead of or in addition to the
`Exchange.AUTHENTICATION` header. First, the context holder uses a
thread-local variable to hold the `Authentication` object. Any routes
that cross thread boundaries, like *seda* or *jms*, will lose the
`Authentication` object. Second, the Spring Security system appears to
expect that an `Authentication` object in the context is already
authenticated and has roles (see the Technical Overview
http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/technical-overview.html#tech-intro-authentication[section
5.3.1] for more details).

The default behavior of *camel-spring-security* is to look for a
`Subject` in the `Exchange.AUTHENTICATION` header. This `Subject` must
contain at least one principal, which must be a subclass of
`org.springframework.security.core.Authentication`. You can customize
the mapping of `Subject` to `Authentication` object by providing an
implementation of the
`org.apache.camel.component.spring.security.AuthenticationAdapter` to
your `<authorizationPolicy>` bean. This can be useful if you are working
with components that do not use Spring Security but do provide a
`Subject`. At this time, only the <<cxf-component,CXF>> component populates
the `Exchange.AUTHENTICATION` header.

[[SpringSecurity-Handlingauthenticationandauthorizationerrors]]
Handling authentication and authorization errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If authentication or authorization fails in the
`SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy`, a `CamelAuthorizationException`
will be thrown. This can be handled using Camel's standard exception
handling methods, like the Exception Clause.
The `CamelAuthorizationException` will have a reference to the ID of the
policy which threw the exception so you can handle errors based on the
policy as well as the type of exception:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<onException>
  <exception>org.springframework.security.authentication.AccessDeniedException</exception>
  <choice>
    <when>
      <simple>${exception.policyId} == 'user'</simple>
      <transform>
        <constant>You do not have ROLE_USER access!</constant>
      </transform>
    </when>
    <when>
      <simple>${exception.policyId} == 'admin'</simple>
      <transform>
        <constant>You do not have ROLE_ADMIN access!</constant>
      </transform>
    </when>
  </choice>
</onException>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[SpringSecurity-Dependencies]]
Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------
 
<dependency> 
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId> 
  <artifactId>camel-spring-security</artifactId> 
  <version>2.4.0</version> 
</dependency> 
-------------------------------------------------

This dependency will also pull in
`org.springframework.security:spring-security-core:3.0.3.RELEASE` and
`org.springframework.security:spring-security-config:3.0.3.RELEASE`.
