*Since Camel {since}*

The GZip Deflater Data Format is a message compression and
de-compression format. It uses the same deflate algorithm that is used
in the Zip data format, although some additional
headers are provided. This format is produced by popular `gzip`/`gunzip`
tool. Messages marshalled using GZip compression can be unmarshalled
using GZip decompression just prior to being consumed at the endpoint.
The compression capability is quite useful when you deal with large XML
and Text based payloads or when you read messages previously comressed
using `gzip` tool.

[NOTE]
====
This dataformat is not for working with gzip files such as uncompressing and building gzip files.
Instead use the zipfile dataformat.

== Options

// dataformat options: START
include::partial$dataformat-options.adoc[]
// dataformat options: END

== Marshal

In this example we marshal a regular text/XML payload to a compressed
payload employing gzip compression format and send it an ActiveMQ queue
called MY_QUEUE.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").marshal().gzipDeflater().to("activemq:queue:MY_QUEUE");
----

== Unmarshal

In this example we unmarshal a gzipped payload from an ActiveMQ queue
called MY_QUEUE to its original format, and forward it for processing to
the `UnGZippedMessageProcessor`.

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:queue:MY_QUEUE").unmarshal().gzipDeflater().process(new UnGZippedMessageProcessor());
----

== Dependencies

This data format is provided in *camel-core* so no additional
dependencies is needed.
