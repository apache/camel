/**
 * This test uses a custom component that will trigger a long-running backing task for certain
 * specific states. The task is forwarded via an asynchronous send to a Camel route which then
 * performs the task, such as an upload or a computation.
 * <p>
 * AWS XRay does monitor the subsegment count per segment and only emits the segment to the local
 * XRay daemon once the segment is closed and its internal count reaches 0. If the segment is closed
 * before the counter reached 0 the segment is not emitted till the last subsegments belonging to
 * that segment got closed.
 * <p>
 * Due to the asynchronous nature of the backing {@link ProcessingCamelBean processing camel bean},
 * the first request is still in progress when the second request is triggered. As those tasks
 * aren't executed in parallel, AWS XRay does not take notice of the seconds processing Camel bean
 * invocation yet which leads to a premature emit of that segment and thus missing subsegments
 * for the route and bean invocation. This is possible as the count of the segment reached 0 when
 * the segment got closed as Camel has not had a chance yet to create the subsegments for the
 * asynchronously executed route and its bean invocation.
