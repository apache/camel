*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The RSS component is used for polling RSS feeds. Camel will default
poll the feed every 60th seconds.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-rss</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

*Note:* The component currently only supports polling (consuming) feeds.

== URI format

----------
rss:rssUri
----------

Where `rssUri` is the URI to the RSS feed to poll.

// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or
directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END
// component options: START
== Component Options


The RSS component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The RSS endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
rss:feedUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *feedUri* | *Required* The URI to the feed to poll. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (27 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *feedHeader* (consumer) | Sets whether to add the feed object as a header. | true | boolean
| *filter* (consumer) | Sets whether to use filtering or not of the entries. | true | boolean
| *lastUpdate* (consumer) | Sets the timestamp to be used for filtering entries from the atom feeds. This options is only in conjunction with the splitEntries. |  | Date
| *password* (consumer) | Sets the password to be used for basic authentication when polling from a HTTP feed. |  | String
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *sortEntries* (consumer) | Sets whether to sort entries by published date. Only works when splitEntries = true. | false | boolean
| *splitEntries* (consumer) | Sets whether or not entries should be sent individually or whether the entire feed should be sent as a single message | true | boolean
| *throttleEntries* (consumer) | Sets whether all entries identified in a single feed poll should be delivered immediately. If true, only one entry is processed per delay. Only applicable when splitEntries = true. | true | boolean
| *username* (consumer) | Sets the username to be used for basic authentication when polling from a HTTP feed. |  | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. There are 6 enums and the value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel
| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutorService
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. Use value spring or quartz for built in scheduler | none | Object
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map
| *startScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | boolean
| *timeUnit* (scheduler) | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. There are 7 enums and the value can be one of: NANOSECONDS, MICROSECONDS, MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit
| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean

// endpoint options: END


== Exchange data types

Camel initializes the In body on the Exchange with a ROME `SyndFeed`.
Depending on the value of the `splitEntries` flag, Camel returns either
a `SyndFeed` with one `SyndEntry` or a `java.util.List` of `SyndEntrys`.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Value |Behavior

|`splitEntries` |`true` |A single entry from the current feed is set in the exchange.

|`splitEntries` |`false` |The entire list of entries from the current feed is set in the exchange.
|=======================================================================

== Message Headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Description

|`CamelRssFeed` |The entire `SyncFeed` object.
|=======================================================================


== Example

If the URL for the RSS feed uses query parameters, this component will
resolve them. For example if the feed uses `alt=rss`, then the following example will be resolved:

[source,java]
----
from("rss:http://someserver.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss&splitEntries=false&delay=1000")
    .to("bean:rss");
----

== Filtering entries

You can filter out entries using XPath, as shown in the
data format section above. You can also exploit Camel's
Bean Integration to implement your own
conditions. For instance, a filter equivalent to the XPath example above
would be:

[source,java]
----
from("rss:file:src/test/data/rss20.xml?splitEntries=true&delay=100")
    .filter().method("myFilterBean", "titleContainsCamel")
        .to("mock:result");
----

The custom bean for this would be:

[source,java]
----
public static class FilterBean {

    public boolean titleContainsCamel(@Body SyndFeed feed) {
        SyndEntry firstEntry = (SyndEntry) feed.getEntries().get(0);
        return firstEntry.getTitle().contains("Camel");
    }
}
----
