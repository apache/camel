= RSS Component

*Since Camel 2.0*

// HEADER START
*Only consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The RSS component is used for polling RSS feeds. Camel will default
poll the feed every 60th seconds.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-rss</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

*Note:* The component currently only supports polling (consuming) feeds.

== URI format

[source,java]
----------
rss:rssUri
----------

Where `rssUri` is the URI to the RSS feed to poll.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options


// component options: START
The RSS component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The RSS endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
rss:feedUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]

| *feedUri* | *Required* The URI to the feed to poll. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (29 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *feedHeader* (consumer) | Sets whether to add the feed object as a header. | true | boolean
| *filter* (consumer) | Sets whether to use filtering or not of the entries. | true | boolean
| *lastUpdate* (consumer) | Sets the timestamp to be used for filtering entries from the atom feeds. This options is only in conjunction with the splitEntries. |  | Date
| *password* (consumer) | Sets the password to be used for basic authentication when polling from a HTTP feed. |  | String
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean

| *splitEntries* (consumer) | Sets whether or not entries should be sent individually or whether the entire feed should be sent as a single message | true | boolean
| *throttleEntries* (consumer) | Sets whether all entries identified in a single feed poll should be delivered immediately. If true, only one entry is processed per consumer.delay. Only applicable when splitEntries = true. | true | boolean
| *username* (consumer) | Sets the username to be used for basic authentication when polling from a HTTP feed. |  | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler

| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel

// endpoint options: END



== Exchange data types

Camel initializes the In body on the Exchange with a ROME `SyndFeed`.
Depending on the value of the `splitEntries` flag, Camel returns either
a `SyndFeed` with one `SyndEntry` or a `java.util.List` of `SyndEntrys`.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Value |Behavior

|`splitEntries` |`true` |A single entry from the current feed is set in the exchange.

|`splitEntries` |`false` |The entire list of entries from the current feed is set in the exchange.
|=======================================================================

== Message Headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Description

|`CamelRssFeed` |The entire `SyncFeed` object.
|=======================================================================

== RSS Dataformat

The RSS component ships with an RSS dataformat that can be used to
convert between String (as XML) and ROME RSS model objects.

* marshal = from ROME `SyndFeed` to XML `String`
* unmarshal = from XML `String` to ROME `SyndFeed`

A route using the RSS dataformat will look like this:

[source,java]
----
from("rss:file:src/test/data/rss20.xml?splitEntries=false&delay=1000")
  .marshal().rss()
  .to("mock:marshal");
----

The purpose of this feature is to make it possible to use Camel's built-in expressions for manipulating RSS messages. As shown below, an
XPath expression can be used to filter the RSS message. In the following example, on ly entries with Camel in the title will get through the filter.

[source,java]
----
from("rss:file:src/test/data/rss20.xml?splitEntries=true&delay=100")
  .marshal().rss()
  .filter().xpath("//item/title[contains(.,'Camel')]")
    .to("mock:result");
----

[TIP]
====
If the URL for the RSS feed uses query parameters, this component will
resolve them. For example if the feed uses `alt=rss`, then the following example will be resolved:

[source,java]
----
from("rss:http://someserver.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss&splitEntries=false&delay=1000")
    .to("bean:rss");
----
====

== Filtering entries

You can filter out entries using XPath, as shown in the
data format section above. You can also exploit Camel's
Bean Integration to implement your own
conditions. For instance, a filter equivalent to the XPath example above
would be:

[source,java]
----
from("rss:file:src/test/data/rss20.xml?splitEntries=true&delay=100")
    .filter().method("myFilterBean", "titleContainsCamel")
        .to("mock:result");
----

The custom bean for this would be:

[source,java]
----
public static class FilterBean {

    public boolean titleContainsCamel(@Body SyndFeed feed) {
        SyndEntry firstEntry = (SyndEntry) feed.getEntries().get(0);
        return firstEntry.getTitle().contains("Camel");
    }
}
----
