*Since Camel {since}*

Camel comes with a default client request validator for the Camel Rest DSL.

The `camel-openapi-validator` uses the 3rd-party
the https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-request-validator/src/master/[Atlassian Swagger Request Validator]
library instead for client request validator. This library is a more extensive validator than
the default validator from `camel-core`.

NOTE: This library does not work with running in `camel-jbang`.

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-openapi-validator` dependency to the classpath.
