= AWS KMS Component

*Since Camel 2.21*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The KMS component supports the ability to work with keys stored in
https://aws.amazon.com/kms/[AWS KMS] instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon KMS. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/kms/[Amazon KMS].

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws-kms://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS KMS component supports 11 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *configuration* (producer) | The Component configuration |  | KMSConfiguration
| *kmsClient* (producer) | To use a existing configured AWS KMS as client |  | AWSKMS
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. The value can be one of: listKeys, createKey, disableKey, scheduleKeyDeletion, describeKey, enableKey |  | KMSOperations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the KMS client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the KMS client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the KMS client. The value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which KMS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *secretKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The AWS KMS endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-kms:label
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *label* | *Required* Logical name |  | String

=== Query Parameters (11 parameters):

Required KMS component options

You have to provide the amazonKmsClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/kms/[Amazon KMS] service.

== Usage

=== Message headers evaluated by the KMS producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKMSLimit` |`Integer` |The limit number of keys to return while performing a listKeys operation

|`CamelAwsKMSOperation` |`String` |The operation we want to perform

|`CamelAwsKMSDescription` |`String` |A key description to use while performing a createKey operation

|`CamelAwsKMSKeyId` |`String` |The key Id 
|=======================================================================

=== KMS Producer operations

Camel-AWS KMS component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listKeys
- createKey
- disableKey
- scheduleKeyDeletion
- describeKey
- enableKey

== Producer Examples

- listKeys: this operation will list the available keys in KMS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listKeys")
      .to("aws-kms://test?kmsClient=#amazonKmsClient&operation=listKeys")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Automatic detection of AWSKMS client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AWSKMS bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-kms</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version\}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
