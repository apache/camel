= Yammer Component

*Since Camel 2.12*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Yammer component allows you to interact with the
https://www.yammer.com[Yammer] enterprise social network.
Consuming messages and users is supported as well as creating new messages.

Yammer uses OAuth 2 for all client application authentication.
In order to use camel-yammer with your account, you'll need to create a new application within Yammer and grant the application access to your account.
Finally, generate your access token.
More details are at
https://developer.yammer.com/authentication/.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml for this component:

== Component options

The Yammer component can be configured with the Yammer account settings which are mandatory to configure before using.




// component options: START
The Yammer component supports 15 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *useJson* (common) | Set to true if you want to use raw JSON rather than converting to POJOs. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *delay* (consumer) | Delay between polling in millis | 5000 | long
| *limit* (consumer) | Return only the specified number of messages. Works for threaded set to true and threaded set to extended. | -1 | int
| *newerThan* (consumer) | Returns messages newer than the message ID specified as a numeric string. This should be used when polling for new messages. If you're looking at messages, and the most recent message returned is 3516, you can make a request with the parameter newerThan equals to 3516 to ensure that you do not get duplicate copies of messages already on your page. | -1 | long
| *olderThan* (consumer) | Returns messages older than the message ID specified as a numeric string. This is useful for paginating messages. For example, if you're currently viewing 20 messages and the oldest is number 2912, you could append olderThan equals to 2912 to your request to get the 20 messages prior to those you're seeing. | -1 | long
| *threaded* (consumer) | threaded equals to true will only return the first message in each thread. This parameter is intended for apps which display message threads collapsed. threaded equals to extended will return the thread starter messages in order of most recently active as well as the two most recent messages, as they are viewed in the default view on the Yammer web interface. The value can be one of: true, extended |  | String
| *userId* (consumer) | The user id |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Component configuration |  | YammerConfiguration
| *requestor* (advanced) | To use a specific requester to communicate with Yammer. |  | ApiRequestor
| *accessToken* (security) | *Required* The access token |  | String
| *consumerKey* (security) | *Required* The consumer key |  | String
| *consumerSecret* (security) | *Required* The consumer secret |  | String

| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row.

When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long

== Consuming messages

The Yammer component provides several endpoints for consuming messages:

[width="100%",cols="2l,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|URI |Description
| yammer:messages?[options]
|All public messages in the user's (whose access token is being used to
make the API call) Yammer network. Corresponds to "All" conversations in
the Yammer web interface.
| yammer:my_feed?[options]
|The user's feed, based on the selection they have made between
"Following" and "Top" conversations.
|yammer:algo?[options]
|The algorithmic feed for the user that corresponds to "Top"
conversations, which is what the vast majority of users will see in the
Yammer web interface.
|yammer:following?[options]
|The "Following" feed which is conversations involving people, groups
and topics that the user is following.
|yammer:sent?[options]
|All messages sent by the user.
|yammer:private?[options]
|Private messages received by the user.
|yammer:received?[options]
|All messages received by the user
|=======================================================================

=== Message format

All messages by default are converted to a POJO model provided in the
`org.apache.camel.component.yammer.model` package.
The original message coming from yammer is in JSON. For all message consuming and producing endpoints, a `Messages` object is returned.
Take for example a route like:

[source,java]
----
from("yammer:messages?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

and lets say the yammer server returns:

[source,json]
----
{
    "messages":[
        {
            "replied_to_id":null,
            "network_id":7654,
            "url":"https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/305298242",
            "thread_id":305298242,
            "id":305298242,
            "message_type":"update",
            "chat_client_sequence":null,
            "body":{
                "parsed":"Testing yammer API...",
                "plain":"Testing yammer API...",
                "rich":"Testing yammer API..."
            },
            "client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/",
            "content_excerpt":"Testing yammer API...",
            "created_at":"2013/06/25 18:14:45 +0000",
            "client_type":"Web",
            "privacy":"public",
            "sender_type":"user",
            "liked_by":{
                "count":1,
                "names":[
                    {
                        "permalink":"janstey",
                        "full_name":"Jonathan Anstey",
                        "user_id":1499642294
                    }

                ]

            },
            "sender_id":1499642294,
            "language":null,
            "system_message":false,
            "attachments":[

            ],
            "direct_message":false,
            "web_url":"https://www.yammer.com/redhat.com/messages/305298242"
        },
        {
            "replied_to_id":null,
            "network_id":7654,
            "url":"https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/294326302",
            "thread_id":294326302,
            "id":294326302,
            "message_type":"system",
            "chat_client_sequence":null,
            "body":{
                "parsed":"(Principal Software Engineer) has [[tag:14658]] the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
                "plain":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
                "rich":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan."
            },
            "client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/",
            "content_excerpt":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
            "created_at":"2013/05/10 19:08:29 +0000",
            "client_type":"Web",
            "sender_type":"user",
            "privacy":"public",
            "liked_by":{
                "count":0,
                "names":[

                ]

            }
        }
        ]

    }
----

Camel will marshal that into a `Messages` object containing 2 `Message`
objects.
As shown below there is a rich object model that makes it easy to get any information you need:

[source,java]
----
Exchange exchange = mock.getExchanges().get(0);
Messages messages = exchange.getIn().getBody(Messages.class);

assertEquals(2, messages.getMessages().size());
assertEquals("Testing yammer API...", messages.getMessages().get(0).getBody().getPlain());
assertEquals("(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.", messages.getMessages().get(1).getBody().getPlain());
----

That said, marshaling this data into POJOs is not free so if you need you can switch back to using pure JSON by adding the `useJson=false`
option to your URI.

== Creating messages

To create a new message in the account of the current user, you can use the following URI:

[source]
----
yammer:messages?[options]
----

The current Camel message body is what will be used to set the text of the Yammer message.
The response body will include the new message formatted the same way as when you consume messages (i.e. as a `Messages`
object by default).

Take this route for instance:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("yammer:messages?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

By sending to the `direct:start` endpoint a `"Hi from Camel!"` message body:

[source,java]
----
template.sendBody("direct:start", "Hi from Camel!");
----

a new message will be created in the current user's account on the server and also this new message will be returned to Camel and converted into a `Messages` object.
Like when consuming messages you can interrogate the `Messages` object:

[source,java]
----
Exchange exchange = mock.getExchanges().get(0);
Messages messages = exchange.getIn().getBody(Messages.class);

assertEquals(1, messages.getMessages().size());
assertEquals("Hi from Camel!", messages.getMessages().get(0).getBody().getPlain());
----

== Retrieving users

The Yammer component provides several endpoints for retrieving users:

[width="100%",cols="2l,3",options="header",]
|=====================================================
|URI |Description
|yammer:users?[options]
|Retrieve users in the current user's Yammer network.
|yammer:current?[options]
|View data about the current user.
|=====================================================

== Using an enricher

It is helpful sometimes (or maybe always in the case of users to use an enricher pattern rather than a route initiated with one of the polling consumers in camel-yammer.
This is because the consumers will fire repeatedly, however often you set the delay for.
If you just want to look up a user's data, or grab a message at a point in time, it is better to call that consumer once and then get one with your route.

Lets say you have a route that at some point needs to go out and fetch user data for the current user.
Rather than polling for this user over and over again, use the `pollEnrich` DSL method:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .pollEnrich("yammer:current?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

This will go out and fetch the current user's `User` object and set it as the Camel message body.
