## Yammer Component

*Available as of Camel 2.12*

The Yammer component allows you to interact with the
https://www.yammer.com[Yammer] enterprise social network. Consuming
messages, users, and user relationships is supported as well as creating
new messages.

Yammer uses OAuth 2 for all client application authentication. In order
to use camel-yammer with your account, you'll need to create a new
application within Yammer and grant the application access to your
account. Finally, generate your access token. More details are at
https://developer.yammer.com/authentication/.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-yammer</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

### URI format

[source]
----
yammer:[function]?[options]
----

### Component options

The Yammer component can be configured with the Yammer account settings
which are mandatory to configure before using.




// component options: START
The Yammer component supports 4 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| consumerKey | security |  | String | The consumer key
| consumerSecret | security |  | String | The consumer secret
| accessToken | security |  | String | The access token
| config | advanced |  | YammerConfiguration | To use a shared yammer configuration
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// component options: END




You can also configure these options directly in the endpoint.

### Endpoint options



// endpoint options: START
The Yammer component supports 29 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| function | common |  | YammerFunctionType | *Required* The function to use
| useJson | common | false | boolean | Set to true if you want to use raw JSON rather than converting to POJOs.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| delay | consumer | 5000 | long | Delay between polling in millis
| limit | consumer | -1 | int | Return only the specified number of messages. Works for threaded=true and threaded=extended.
| newerThan | consumer | -1 | int | Returns messages newer than the message ID specified as a numeric string. This should be used when polling for new messages. If you're looking at messages and the most recent message returned is 3516 you can make a request with the parameter newerThan=3516 to ensure that you do not get duplicate copies of messages already on your page.
| olderThan | consumer | -1 | int | Returns messages older than the message ID specified as a numeric string. This is useful for paginating messages. For example if you're currently viewing 20 messages and the oldest is number 2912 you could append olderThan=2912 to your request to get the 20 messages prior to those you're seeing.
| sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle | consumer | false | boolean | If the polling consumer did not poll any files you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead.
| threaded | consumer |  | String | threaded=true will only return the first message in each thread. This parameter is intended for apps which display message threads collapsed. threaded=extended will return the thread starter messages in order of most recently active as well as the two most recent messages as they are viewed in the default view on the Yammer web interface.
| userId | consumer |  | String | The user id
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.
| pollStrategy | consumer (advanced) |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
| backoffErrorThreshold | scheduler |  | int | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
| backoffIdleThreshold | scheduler |  | int | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
| backoffMultiplier | scheduler |  | int | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured.
| greedy | scheduler | false | boolean | If greedy is enabled then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if the previous run polled 1 or more messages.
| initialDelay | scheduler | 1000 | long | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. You can also specify time values using units such as 60s (60 seconds) 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds) and 1h (1 hour).
| runLoggingLevel | scheduler | TRACE | LoggingLevel | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that.
| scheduledExecutorService | scheduler |  | ScheduledExecutorService | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool.
| scheduler | scheduler | none | ScheduledPollConsumerScheduler | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz2 component
| schedulerProperties | scheduler |  | Map | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz2 Spring based scheduler.
| startScheduler | scheduler | true | boolean | Whether the scheduler should be auto started.
| timeUnit | scheduler | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options.
| useFixedDelay | scheduler | true | boolean | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details.
| accessToken | security |  | String | *Required* The access token
| consumerKey | security |  | String | *Required* The consumer key
| consumerSecret | security |  | String | *Required* The consumer secret

### Consuming messages

The Yammer component provides several endpoints for consuming
messages:

[width="100%",cols="2l,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|URI |Description
| yammer:messages?[options]
|All public messages in the user's (whose access token is being used to
make the API call) Yammer network. Corresponds to "All" conversations in
the Yammer web interface.
| yammer:my_feed?[options]
|The user's feed, based on the selection they have made between
"Following" and "Top" conversations.
|yammer:algo?[options]
|The algorithmic feed for the user that corresponds to "Top"
conversations, which is what the vast majority of users will see in the
Yammer web interface.
|yammer:following?[options]
|The "Following" feed which is conversations involving people, groups
and topics that the user is following.
|yammer:sent?[options]
|All messages sent by the user.
|yammer:private?[options]
|Private messages received by the user.
|yammer:received?[options]
|*Camel 2.12.1:* All messages received by the user
|=======================================================================


#### Message format

All messages by default are converted to a POJO model provided in the
`org.apache.camel.component.yammer.model` package. The original message
coming from yammer is in JSON. For all message consuming and producing
endpoints, a `Messages` object is returned. Take for example a route like:

[source,java]
----
from("yammer:messages?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

and lets say the yammer server returns:

[source,json]
----
{
    "messages":[
        {
            "replied_to_id":null,
            "network_id":7654,
            "url":"https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/305298242",
            "thread_id":305298242,
            "id":305298242,
            "message_type":"update",
            "chat_client_sequence":null,
            "body":{
                "parsed":"Testing yammer API...",
                "plain":"Testing yammer API...",
                "rich":"Testing yammer API..."
            },
            "client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/",
            "content_excerpt":"Testing yammer API...",
            "created_at":"2013/06/25 18:14:45 +0000",
            "client_type":"Web",
            "privacy":"public",
            "sender_type":"user",
            "liked_by":{
                "count":1,
                "names":[
                    {
                        "permalink":"janstey",
                        "full_name":"Jonathan Anstey",
                        "user_id":1499642294
                    }

                ]

            },
            "sender_id":1499642294,
            "language":null,
            "system_message":false,
            "attachments":[

            ],
            "direct_message":false,
            "web_url":"https://www.yammer.com/redhat.com/messages/305298242"
        },
        {
            "replied_to_id":null,
            "network_id":7654,
            "url":"https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/294326302",
            "thread_id":294326302,
            "id":294326302,
            "message_type":"system",
            "chat_client_sequence":null,
            "body":{
                "parsed":"(Principal Software Engineer) has [[tag:14658]] the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
                "plain":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
                "rich":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan."
            },
            "client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/",
            "content_excerpt":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
            "created_at":"2013/05/10 19:08:29 +0000",
            "client_type":"Web",
            "sender_type":"user",
            "privacy":"public",
            "liked_by":{
                "count":0,
                "names":[

                ]

            }
        }
        ]

    }
----

Camel will marshal that into a `Messages` object containing 2 `Message`
objects. As shown below there is a rich object model that makes it easy
to get any information you need:

[source,java]
----
Exchange exchange = mock.getExchanges().get(0);
Messages messages = exchange.getIn().getBody(Messages.class);

assertEquals(2, messages.getMessages().size());
assertEquals("Testing yammer API...", messages.getMessages().get(0).getBody().getPlain());
assertEquals("(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.", messages.getMessages().get(1).getBody().getPlain());
----

That said, marshaling this data into POJOs is not free so if you need
you can switch back to using pure JSON by adding the `useJson=false`
option to your URI.

### Creating messages

To create a new message in the account of the current user, you can use
the following URI:

[source]
----
yammer:messages?[options]
----

The current Camel message body is what will be used to set the text of
the Yammer message. The response body will include the new message
formatted the same way as when you consume messages (i.e. as a `Messages`
object by default).

Take this route for instance:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("yammer:messages?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

By sending to the `direct:start` endpoint a `"Hi from Camel!"` message body:

[source,java]
----
template.sendBody("direct:start", "Hi from Camel!");
----

a new message will be created in the current user's account on the
server and also this new message will be returned to Camel and converted
into a `Messages` object. Like when consuming messages you can interrogate
the `Messages` object:

[source,java]
----
Exchange exchange = mock.getExchanges().get(0);
Messages messages = exchange.getIn().getBody(Messages.class);

assertEquals(1, messages.getMessages().size());
assertEquals("Hi from Camel!", messages.getMessages().get(0).getBody().getPlain());
----

### Retrieving user relationships

The Yammer component can retrieve user relationships:

[source]
----
yammer:relationships?[options]
----


### Retrieving users

The Yammer component provides several endpoints for retrieving
users:

[width="100%",cols="2l,3",options="header",]
|=====================================================
|URI |Description
|yammer:users?[options]
|Retrieve users in the current user's Yammer network.
|yammer:current?[options]
|View data about the current user.
|=====================================================


### Using an enricher

It is helpful sometimes (or maybe always in the case of users or
relationship consumers) to use an enricher pattern rather than a route
initiated with one of the polling consumers in camel-yammer. This is
because the consumers will fire repeatedly, however often you set the
delay for. If you just want to look up a user's data, or grab a message
at a point in time, it is better to call that consumer once and then get
one with your route.

Lets say you have a route that at some point needs to go out and fetch
user data for the current user. Rather than polling for this user over
and over again, use the `pollEnrich` DSL method:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .pollEnrich("yammer:current?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

This will go out and fetch the current user's `User` object and set it as
the Camel message body.
