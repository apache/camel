*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Yammer component allows you to interact with the
https://www.yammer.com[Yammer] enterprise social network.
Consuming messages and users is supported as well as creating new messages.

Yammer uses OAuth 2 for all client application authentication.
In order to use camel-yammer with your account, you'll need to create a new application within Yammer and grant the application access to your account.
Finally, generate your access token.
More details are at
https://developer.yammer.com/authentication/.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-yammer</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>

== Consuming messages

The Yammer component provides several endpoints for consuming messages:

[width="100%",cols="2l,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|URI |Description
| yammer:messages?[options]
|All public messages in the user's (whose access token is being used to
make the API call) Yammer network. Corresponds to "All" conversations in
the Yammer web interface.
| yammer:my_feed?[options]
|The user's feed, based on the selection they have made between
"Following" and "Top" conversations.
|yammer:algo?[options]
|The algorithmic feed for the user that corresponds to "Top"
conversations, which is what the vast majority of users will see in the
Yammer web interface.
|yammer:following?[options]
|The "Following" feed which is conversations involving people, groups
and topics that the user is following.
|yammer:sent?[options]
|All messages sent by the user.
|yammer:private?[options]
|Private messages received by the user.
|yammer:received?[options]
|All messages received by the user
|=======================================================================

=== Message format

All messages by default are converted to a POJO model provided in the
`org.apache.camel.component.yammer.model` package.
The original message coming from yammer is in JSON. For all message consuming and producing endpoints, a `Messages` object is returned.
Take for example a route like:

[source,java]
----
from("yammer:messages?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

and lets say the yammer server returns:

[source,json]
----
{
    "messages":[
        {
            "replied_to_id":null,
            "network_id":7654,
            "url":"https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/305298242",
            "thread_id":305298242,
            "id":305298242,
            "message_type":"update",
            "chat_client_sequence":null,
            "body":{
                "parsed":"Testing yammer API...",
                "plain":"Testing yammer API...",
                "rich":"Testing yammer API..."
            },
            "client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/",
            "content_excerpt":"Testing yammer API...",
            "created_at":"2013/06/25 18:14:45 +0000",

                "count":1,
                "names":[
                    {
                        "permalink":"janstey",
                        "full_name":"Jonathan Anstey",
                        "user_id":1499642294
                    }

                ]

            },
            "sender_id":1499642294,
            "language":null,
            "system_message":false,
            "attachments":[

            ],
            "direct_message":false,
            "web_url":"https://www.yammer.com/redhat.com/messages/305298242"
        },
        {
            "replied_to_id":null,
            "network_id":7654,
            "url":"https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages/294326302",
            "thread_id":294326302,
            "id":294326302,
            "message_type":"system",
            "chat_client_sequence":null,
            "body":{
                "parsed":"(Principal Software Engineer) has [[tag:14658]] the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
                "plain":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
                "rich":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan."
            },
            "client_url":"https://www.yammer.com/",
            "content_excerpt":"(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.",
            "created_at":"2013/05/10 19:08:29 +0000",
            "client_type":"Web",
            "sender_type":"user",
            "privacy":"public",
            "liked_by":{
                "count":0,
                "names":[

                ]

            }
        }
        ]

    }
----

Camel will marshal that into a `Messages` object containing 2 `Message`
objects.
As shown below there is a rich object model that makes it easy to get any information you need:

[source,java]
----
Exchange exchange = mock.getExchanges().get(0);
Messages messages = exchange.getIn().getBody(Messages.class);

assertEquals(2, messages.getMessages().size());
assertEquals("Testing yammer API...", messages.getMessages().get(0).getBody().getPlain());
assertEquals("(Principal Software Engineer) has #joined the redhat.com network. Take a moment to welcome Jonathan.", messages.getMessages().get(1).getBody().getPlain());
----

That said, marshaling this data into POJOs is not free so if you need you can switch back to using pure JSON by adding the `useJson=false`
option to your URI.

== Creating messages

To create a new message in the account of the current user, you can use the following URI:

----
yammer:messages?[options]
----

The current Camel message body is what will be used to set the text of the Yammer message.
The response body will include the new message formatted the same way as when you consume messages (i.e. as a `Messages`
object by default).

Take this route for instance:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("yammer:messages?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

By sending to the `direct:start` endpoint a `"Hi from Camel!"` message body:

[source,java]
----
template.sendBody("direct:start", "Hi from Camel!");
----

a new message will be created in the current user's account on the server and also this new message will be returned to Camel and converted into a `Messages` object.
Like when consuming messages you can interrogate the `Messages` object:

[source,java]
----
Exchange exchange = mock.getExchanges().get(0);
Messages messages = exchange.getIn().getBody(Messages.class);

assertEquals(1, messages.getMessages().size());
assertEquals("Hi from Camel!", messages.getMessages().get(0).getBody().getPlain());
----

== Retrieving users

The Yammer component provides several endpoints for retrieving users:

[width="100%",cols="2l,3",options="header",]
|=====================================================
|URI |Description
|yammer:users?[options]
|Retrieve users in the current user's Yammer network.
|yammer:current?[options]
|View data about the current user.
|=====================================================


== Using an enricher

It is helpful sometimes (or maybe always in the case of users to use an enricher pattern rather than a route initiated with one of the polling consumers in camel-yammer.
This is because the consumers will fire repeatedly, however often you set the delay for.
If you just want to look up a user's data, or grab a message at a point in time, it is better to call that consumer once and then get one with your route.

Lets say you have a route that at some point needs to go out and fetch user data for the current user.
Rather than polling for this user over and over again, use the `pollEnrich` DSL method:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .pollEnrich("yammer:current?consumerKey=aConsumerKey&consumerSecret=aConsumerSecretKey&accessToken=aAccessToken")
    .to("mock:result");
----

This will go out and fetch the current user's `User` object and set it as the Camel message body.
