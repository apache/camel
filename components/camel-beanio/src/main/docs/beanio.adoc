[[BeanIO-BeanIO]]
BeanIO
~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.10*

The BeanIO link:data-format.html[Data Format] uses
http://beanio.org/[BeanIO] to handle flat payloads (such as XML, CSV,
delimited, or fixed length formats).

BeanIO is configured using a
http://beanio.org/2.0/docs/reference/index.html#TheMappingFile[mappings
XML] file where you define the mapping from the flat format to Objects
(POJOs). This mapping file is mandatory to use.

[[BeanIO-UsingJavaDSL]]
Using Java DSL
++++++++++++++

To use the `BeanIODataFormat` you need to configure the data format with
the mapping file, as well the name of the stream. +
 In Java DSL this can be done as shown below. The streamName is
"employeeFile".

Then we have two routes. The first route is for transforming CSV data
into a List<Employee> Java objects. Which we then
link:splitter.html[split], so the mock endpoint +
 receives a message for each row.

The 2nd route is for the reverse operation, to transform a
List<Employee> into a stream of CSV data.

The CSV data could for example be as below:

[[BeanIO-UsingXMLDSL]]
Using XML DSL
+++++++++++++

To use the BeanIO data format in XML, you need to configure it using the
<beanio> XML tag as shown below. The routes is similar to the example
above.

[[BeanIO-Dependencies]]
Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use BeanIO in your Camel routes you need to add a dependency on
*camel-beanio* which implements this data format.

If you use Maven you can just add the following to your pom.xml,
substituting the version number for the latest & greatest release (see
link:download.html[the download page for the latest versions]).
