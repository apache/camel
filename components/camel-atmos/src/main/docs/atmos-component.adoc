== Atmos Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.15*

*Camel-Atmos* is an http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel] component that
allows you to work with ViPR object data services using the
https://github.com/emcvipr/dataservices-sdk-java[Atmos Client].

[source,java]
-------------------------------
from("atmos:foo/get?remotePath=/path").to("mock:test");

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (2 parameters):

==== Query Parameters (12 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *enableSslValidation* (common) | Atmos SSL validation | false | boolean

| *uri* (common) | Atomos server uri |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

### Dependencies

To use Atmos in your camel routes you need to add the dependency
on *camel-atmos* which implements this data format.

If you use maven you could just add the following to your pom.xml,
substituting the version number for the latest & greatest release (see
link:download.html[the download page for the latest versions]).

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-atmos</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

[[Atmos-Integrations]]

### Integrations

When you look at atmos integrations, there is one type of consumer, 
GetConsumer, which is a type of ScheduledPollConsumer. 

* `Get`

Whereas there are 4 types of producers which are 

* `Get` 
* `Del` 
* `Move`
* `Put`

### Examples

These example are taken from tests:

[source,java]
-------------------------------
from("atmos:foo/get?remotePath=/path").to("mock:test");
-------------------------------

Here, this is a consumer example.
`remotePath` represents the path from where the data will
be read and passes the camel exchange to regarding producer
Underneath, this component uses atmos client API for this and
every other operations.

[source,java]
-------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("atmos://get?remotePath=/dummy/dummy.txt")
.to("mock:result");
-------------------------------

Here, this a producer sample.
`remotePath` represents the path where the operations occur
on ViPR object data service. In producers, operations(`Get`,`Del`,
`Move`,`Put`) run on ViPR object data services and results are set 
on headers of camel exchange.

Regarding the operations, the following headers are set on camel
exhange

[source,java]
-------------------------------
DOWNLOADED_FILE, DOWNLOADED_FILES, UPLOADED_FILE, UPLOADED_FILES, FOUND_FILES, DELETED_PATH, MOVED_PATH;
