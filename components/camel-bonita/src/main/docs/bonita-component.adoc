[[bonita-component]]
= Bonita Component

*Since Camel 2.19*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

Used for communicating with a remote Bonita BPM process engine.

== URI format

[source,java]
------------------------------
bonita://[operation]?[options]
------------------------------

Where *operation* is the specific action to perform on Bonita.

== General Options

// component options: START
The Bonita component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Bonita endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
bonita:operation
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *operation* | *Required* Operation to use. The value can be one of: startCase |  | BonitaOperation
|===


=== Query Parameters (8 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *hostname* (producer) | Hostname where Bonita engine runs | localhost | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *port* (producer) | Port of the server hosting Bonita engine | 8080 | String
| *processName* (producer) | Name of the process involved in the operation |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *password* (security) | Password to authenticate to Bonita engine. |  | String
| *username* (security) | Username to authenticate to Bonita engine. |  | String
|===
// endpoint options: END
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-bonita-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.bonita.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.bonita.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.bonita.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the bonita component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.bonita.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean

== Body content

For the startCase operation, the input variables are retrieved from the body message. This one has to contains a Map<String,Serializable>.


== Examples

The following example start a new case in Bonita:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start").to("bonita:startCase?hostname=localhost&amp;port=8080&amp;processName=TestProcess&amp;username=install&amp;password=install")
----------------------------------------------------------------------

== Dependencies

To use Bonita in your Camel routes you need to add a dependency on
*camel-bonita*, which implements the component.

If you use Maven you can just add the following to your pom.xml,
substituting the version number for the latest and greatest release (see
the download page for the latest versions).

[source,java]
-------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-bonita</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
-------------------------------------
