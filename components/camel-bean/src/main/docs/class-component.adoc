*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Class component binds beans to Camel message exchanges. It works
in the same way as the xref:bean-component.adoc[Bean] component but instead of
looking up beans from a Registry it creates the bean
based on the class name.

== URI format

----
class:className[?options]
----

Where *className* is the fully qualified class name to create and use as
bean.


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The Class component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *cache* (producer) | *Deprecated* Use singleton option instead. | true | Boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *scope* (producer) | Scope of bean. When using singleton scope (default) the bean is created or looked up only once and reused for the lifetime of the endpoint. The bean should be thread-safe in case concurrent threads is calling the bean at the same time. When using request scope the bean is created or looked up once per request (exchange). This can be used if you want to store state on a bean while processing a request and you want to call the same bean instance multiple times while processing the request. The bean does not have to be thread-safe as the instance is only called from the same request. When using delegate scope, then the bean will be looked up or created per call. However in case of lookup then this is delegated to the bean registry such as Spring or CDI (if in use), which depends on their configuration can act as either singleton or prototype scope. so when using prototype then this depends on the delegated registry. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: Singleton, Request, Prototype | Singleton | BeanScope
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The Class endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
class:beanName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *beanName* | *Required* Sets the name of the bean to invoke |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (5 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *cache* (common) | *Deprecated* Use scope option instead. |  | Boolean
| *method* (common) | Sets the name of the method to invoke on the bean |  | String
| *scope* (common) | Scope of bean. When using singleton scope (default) the bean is created or looked up only once and reused for the lifetime of the endpoint. The bean should be thread-safe in case concurrent threads is calling the bean at the same time. When using request scope the bean is created or looked up once per request (exchange). This can be used if you want to store state on a bean while processing a request and you want to call the same bean instance multiple times while processing the request. The bean does not have to be thread-safe as the instance is only called from the same request. When using prototype scope, then the bean will be looked up or created per call.

There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: Singleton, Request, Prototype | Singleton | BeanScope
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message).

| *parameters* (advanced) | Used for configuring additional properties on the bean |  | Map

== Using

You simply use the *class* component just as the xref:bean-component.adoc[Bean]
component but by specifying the fully qualified classname instead. +
 For example to use the `MyFooBean` you have to do as follows:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    from("direct:start").to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyFooBean").to("mock:result");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also specify which method to invoke on the `MyFooBean`, for
example `hello`:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    from("direct:start").to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyFooBean?method=hello").to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Setting properties on the created instance

In the endpoint uri you can specify properties to set on the created
instance, for example if it has a `setPrefix` method:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   from("direct:start")
        .to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyPrefixBean?bean.prefix=Bye")
        .to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And you can also use the `#` syntax to refer to properties to be looked
up in the Registry.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    from("direct:start")
        .to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyPrefixBean?bean.cool=#foo")
        .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which will lookup a bean from the Registry with the
id `foo` and invoke the `setCool` method on the created instance of the
`MyPrefixBean` class.

[TIP]
====
See more details at the xref:bean-component.adoc[Bean] component as the *class*
component works in much the same way.
