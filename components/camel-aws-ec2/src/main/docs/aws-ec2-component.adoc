*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The EC2 component supports the ability to create, run, start, stop and terminate
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS EC2] instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon EC2. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2].

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws-ec2://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) component supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoDiscoverClient* (common) | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *amazonEc2Client* (producer) | To use a existing configured AmazonEC2Client as client |  | AmazonEC2
| *configuration* (producer) | The component configuration |  | EC2Configuration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. It can be createAndRunInstances, startInstances, stopInstances, terminateInstances, describeInstances, describeInstancesStatus, rebootInstances, monitorInstances, unmonitorInstances, createTags or deleteTags. There are 11 enums and the value can be one of: createAndRunInstances, startInstances, stopInstances, terminateInstances, describeInstances, describeInstancesStatus, rebootInstances, monitorInstances, unmonitorInstances, createTags, deleteTags |  | EC2Operations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the EC2 client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the EC2 client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the EC2 client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which ECS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *secretKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-ec2:label
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *label* | *Required* Logical name |  | String

=== Query Parameters (11 parameters):

There are 11 enums and the value can be one of: createAndRunInstances, startInstances, stopInstances, terminateInstances, describeInstances, describeInstancesStatus, rebootInstances, monitorInstances, unmonitorInstances, createTags, deleteTags |  | EC2Operations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the EC2 client |  | String

| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

Required EC2 component options

You have to provide the amazonEc2Client in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] service.

== Usage

=== Message headers evaluated by the EC2 producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsEC2ImageId` |`String` |An image ID of the AWS marketplace

|`CamelAwsEC2InstanceType` |com.amazonaws.services.ec2.model.InstanceType |The instance type we want to create and run

|`CamelAwsEC2Operation` |`String` |The operation we want to perform

|`CamelAwsEC2InstanceMinCount` |`Int` |The mininum number of instances we want to run.

|`CamelAwsEC2InstanceMaxCount` |`Int` |The maximum number of instances we want to run.

|`CamelAwsEC2InstanceMonitoring` |Boolean |Define if we want the running instances to be monitored

|`CamelAwsEC2InstanceEbsOptimized` |`Boolean` |Define if the creating instance is optimized for EBS I/O.

|`CamelAwsEC2InstanceSecurityGroups` |Collection |The security groups to associate to the instances

|`CamelAwsEC2InstancesIds` |`Collection` |A collection of instances IDS to execute start, stop, describe and
terminate operations on.

|`CamelAwsEC2InstancesTags` |`Collection` |A collection of tags to add or remove from EC2 resources
|=======================================================================

== Supported producer operations

- createAndRunInstances
- startInstances
- stopInstances
- terminateInstances
- describeInstances
- describeInstancesStatus
- rebootInstances
- monitorInstances
- unmonitorInstances
- createTags
- deleteTags

== Producer Examples

- createAndRunInstances: this operation will create an EC2 instance and run it

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:createAndRun")
     .setHeader(EC2Constants.IMAGE_ID, constant("ami-fd65ba94"))
     .setHeader(EC2Constants.INSTANCE_TYPE, constant(InstanceType.T2Micro))
     .setHeader(EC2Constants.INSTANCE_MIN_COUNT, constant("1"))
     .setHeader(EC2Constants.INSTANCE_MAX_COUNT, constant("1"))
     .to("aws-ec2://TestDomain?accessKey=xxxx&secretKey=xxxx&operation=createAndRunInstances");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Automatic detection of AmazonEC2 client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonEC2 bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-ec2</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
