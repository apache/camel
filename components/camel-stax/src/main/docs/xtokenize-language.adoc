*Since Camel {since}*

The XML Tokenize language is a built-in language in `camel-stax`, which
is a truly XML-aware tokenizer that can be used with the xref:eips:split-eip.adoc[Split] EIP
as the conventional xref:tokenize-language.adoc[Tokenize] to efficiently and
effectively tokenize XML documents.

XML Tokenize is capable of not only recognizing XML namespaces and hierarchical structures of the document
but also more efficiently tokenizing XML documents than the conventional xref:tokenize-language.adoc[Tokenize] language.
