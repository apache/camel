## Crypto (JCE) Component

*Available as of Camel 2.3* 
*PGP Available as of Camel 2.9*

The Crypto link:data-format.html[Data Format] integrates the Java
Cryptographic Extension into Camel, allowing simple and flexible
encryption and decryption of messages using Camel's familiar marshall
and unmarshal formatting mechanism. It assumes marshalling to mean
encryption to cyphertext and unmarshalling to mean decryption back to
the original plaintext. This data format implements only symmetric
(shared-key) encryption and decyption.

[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| cryptoOperation | producer |  | CryptoOperation | *Required* Set the Crypto operation from that supplied after the crypto scheme in the endpoint uri e.g. crypto:sign sets sign as the operation.
| name | producer |  | String | *Required* The logical name of this operation.
| algorithm | producer | SHA1WithDSA | String | Sets the JCE name of the Algorithm that should be used for the signer.
| alias | producer |  | String | Sets the alias used to query the KeyStore for keys and link java.security.cert.Certificate Certificates to be used in signing and verifying exchanges. This value can be provided at runtime via the message header link org.apache.camel.component.crypto.DigitalSignatureConstantsKEYSTORE_ALIAS
| certificateName | producer |  | String | Sets the reference name for a PrivateKey that can be fond in the registry.
| keystore | producer |  | KeyStore | Sets the KeyStore that can contain keys and Certficates for use in signing and verifying exchanges. A KeyStore is typically used with an alias either one supplied in the Route definition or dynamically via the message header CamelSignatureKeyStoreAlias. If no alias is supplied and there is only a single entry in the Keystore then this single entry will be used.
| keystoreName | producer |  | String | Sets the reference name for a Keystore that can be fond in the registry.

### Basic Usage

At its most basic all that is required to encrypt/decrypt an exchange is
a shared secret key. If one or more instances of the Crypto data format
are configured with this key the format can be used to encrypt the
payload in one route (or part of one) and decrypted in another. For
example, using the Java DSL as follows:

In Spring the dataformat is configured first and then used in routes

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <dataFormats>
    <crypto id="basic" algorithm="DES" keyRef="desKey" />
  </dataFormats>
    ...
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:basic-encryption" />
    <marshal ref="basic" />
    <to uri="mock:encrypted" />
    <unmarshal ref="basic" />
    <to uri="mock:unencrypted" />
  </route>
</camelContext>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Specifying the Encryption Algorithm

Changing the algorithm is a matter of supplying the JCE algorithm name.
If you change the algorithm you will need to use a compatible key.

A list of the available algorithms in Java 7 is available via the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html[Java
Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation].

### Specifying an Initialization Vector

Some crypto algorithms, particularly block algorithms, require
configuration with an initial block of data known as an Initialization
Vector. In the JCE this is passed as an AlgorithmParameterSpec when the
Cipher is initialized. To use such a vector with the CryptoDataFormat
you can configure it with a byte[] containing the required data e.g.

or with spring, suppling a reference to a byte[]

The same vector is required in both the encryption and decryption
phases. As it is not necessary to keep the IV a secret, the DataFormat
allows for it to be inlined into the encrypted data and subsequently
read out in the decryption phase to initialize the Cipher. To inline the
IV set the /oinline flag.

or with spring.

For more information of the use of Initialization Vectors, consult

*
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector]
*
http://www.herongyang.com/Cryptography/[http://www.herongyang.com/Cryptography/]
*
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation]

### Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC)

To avoid attacks against the encrypted data while it is in transit the
CryptoDataFormat can also calculate a Message Authentication Code for
the encrypted exchange contents based on a configurable MAC algorithm.
The calculated HMAC is appended to the stream after encryption. It is
separated from the stream in the decryption phase. The MAC is
recalculated and verified against the transmitted version to insure
nothing was tampered with in transit.For more information on Message
Authentication Codes see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC]

or with spring.

By default the HMAC is calculated using the HmacSHA1 mac algorithm
though this can be easily changed by supplying a different algorithm
name. See
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CAMEL&title=here&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=17268915[here]
for how to check what algorithms are available through the configured
security providers

or with spring.

### Supplying Keys Dynamically

When using a Recipient list or similar EIP the recipient of an exchange
can vary dynamically. Using the same key across all recipients may
neither be feasible or desirable. It would be useful to be able to
specify keys dynamically on a per exchange basis. The exchange could
then be dynamically enriched with the key of its target recipient before
being processed by the data format. To facilitate this the DataFormat
allow for keys to be supplied dynamically via the message headers below

* `CryptoDataFormat.KEY` `"CamelCryptoKey"`

or with spring.

### PGP Message

The PGP Data Formater can create and decrypt/verify PGP Messages of the
following PGP packet structure (entries in brackets are optional and
ellipses indicate repetition, comma represents  sequential composition,
and vertical bar separates alternatives):

    Public Key Encrypted Session Key ..., Symmetrically Encrypted Data |
Sym. Encrypted and Integrity Protected Data, (Compressed Data,) (One
Pass Signature ...,) Literal Data, (Signature ...,)

*Since Camel 2.16*.*0* the Compressed Data packet is optional, before it
was mandatory.

 

### PGPDataFormat Options
[width="70%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Default |Description

|`keyUserid` |`String` |`null` |The user ID of the key in the PGP keyring used during encryption. See
also option `keyUserids`. Can also be only a part of a user ID. For
example, if the user ID is "Test User <test@camel.com>" then you can use
the part "Test User" or "<test@camel.com>" to address the user ID.

|`keyUserids` |`List<String>` |`null` |*Since camel 2.12.2*: PGP allows to encrypt the symmetric key by several
asymmetric public receiver keys. You can specify here the User IDs or
parts of User IDs of several public keys contained in the PGP keyring.
If you just have one User ID, then you can also use the option
`keyUserid`. The User ID specified in `keyUserid` and the User IDs in
`keyUserids` will be merged together and the corresponding public keys
will be used for the encryption.

|`password` |`String` |`null` |Password used when opening the private key (not used for encryption).

|`keyFileName` |`String` |`null` |Filename of the keyring; must be accessible as a classpath resource (but
you can specify a location in the file system by using the "file:"
prefix).

|`encryptionKeyRing` |`byte[]` |`null` |*Since camel 2.12.1*: encryption keyring; you can not set the
keyFileName and encryptionKeyRing at the same time.

|`signatureKeyUserid` |`String` |`null` |*Since Camel 2.11.0*; optional User ID of the key in the PGP keyring
used for signing (during encryption) or signature verification (during
decryption). During the signature verification process the specified
User ID restricts the public keys from the public keyring which can be
used for the verification. If no User ID is specified for the signature
verficiation then any public key in the public keyring can be used for
the verification. Can also be only a part of a user ID. For example, if
the user ID is "Test User <test@camel.com>" then you can use the part
"Test User" or "<test@camel.com>" to address the User ID.

|`signatureKeyUserids` |`List<String>` |`null` |*Since Camel 2.12.3*: optional list of User IDs of the key in the PGP
keyring used for signing (during encryption) or signature verification
(during decryption). You can specify here the User IDs or parts of User
IDs of several keys contained in the PGP keyring. If you just have one
User ID, then you can also use the option `keyUserid`. The User ID
specified in `keyUserid` and the User IDs in `keyUserids` will be merged
together and the corresponding keys will be used for the signing or
signature verification. If the specified User IDs reference several keys
then for each key a signature is added to the PGP result during the
encryption-signing process. In the decryption-verifying process the list
of User IDs restricts the list of public keys which can be used for
signature verification. If the list of User IDs is empty then any public
key in the public keyring can be used for the signature verification.

|`signaturePassword` |`String` |`null` |*Since Camel 2.11.0*: optional password used when opening the private
key used for signing (during encryption).

|`signatureKeyFileName` |`String` |`null` |*Since Camel 2.11.0*: optional filename of the keyring to use for
signing (during encryption) or for signature verification (during
decryption); must be accessible as a classpath resource (but you can
specify a location in the file system by using the "file:" prefix).

|`signatureKeyRing` |`byte[]` |`null` |*Since camel 2.12.1*: signature keyring; you can not set the
signatureKeyFileName and signatureKeyRing at the same time.

|`algorithm` |`int` |`SymmetricKeyAlgorithmTags.CAST5` |*Since camel 2.12.2*: symmetric key encryption algorithm; possible
values are defined in `org.bouncycastle.bcpg.SymmetricKeyAlgorithmTags`;
for example 2 (= TRIPLE DES), 3 (= CAST5), 4 (= BLOWFISH), 6 (= DES), 7
(= AES_128). Only relevant for encrypting.

|`compressionAlgorithm` |`int` |`CompressionAlgorithmTags.ZIP` |*Since camel 2.12.2*: compression algorithm; possible values are defined
in `org.bouncycastle.bcpg.CompressionAlgorithmTags`; for example 0 (=
UNCOMPRESSED), 1 (= ZIP), 2 (= ZLIB), 3 (= BZIP2). Only relevant for
encrypting.

|`hashAlgorithm` |`int` |`HashAlgorithmTags.SHA1` |*Since camel 2.12.2*: signature hash algorithm; possible values are
defined in `org.bouncycastle.bcpg.HashAlgorithmTags`; for example 2 (=
SHA1), 8 (= SHA256), 9 (= SHA384), 10 (= SHA512), 11 (=SHA224). Only
relevant for signing.

|`armored` |`boolean` |`false` |This option will cause PGP to base64 encode the encrypted text, making
it available for copy/paste, etc.

|`integrity` |`boolean` |`true` |Adds an integrity check/sign into the encryption file.

|`passphraseAccessor` |`PGPPassphraseAccessor` |`null` |*Since Camel 2.12.2*: provides passphrases corresponding to user Ids. If
no passpharase can be found from the option `password` or
`signaturePassword` and from the headers `CamelPGPDataFormatKeyPassword`
or `CamelPGPDataFormatSignatureKeyPassword` then the passphrase is
fetched from the passphrase accessor. You provide a bean which
implements the interface
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-crypto/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/crypto/PGPPassphraseAccessor.java[PGPPassphraseAccessor].
A default implementation is given by
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-crypto/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/crypto/DefaultPGPPassphraseAccessor.java[DefaultPGPPassphraseAccessor].
The passphrase accessor is especially useful in the decrypt case; see
chapter 'PGP Decrypting/Verifying of Messages Encrypted/Signed by
Different Private/Public Keys' below.

|`signatureVerificationOption` |`String` |`"optional"` |*Since Camel 2.13.0*: controls the behavior for verifying the signature
during unmarshaling. There are three values possible:

* `"optional"`: The PGP message may or may not contain signatures; if it
does contain signatures, then a signature verification is executed. Use
the constant
PGPKeyAccessDataFormat.SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_OPTION_OPTIONAL.
* `"required"`: The PGP message must contain at least one signature; if
this is not the case an exception (PGPException) is thrown. A signature
verification is executed. Use the constant
PGPKeyAccessDataFormat.SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_OPTION_REQUIRED.
* `"ignore"`: Contained signatures in the PGP message are ignored; no
signature verification is executed. Use the constant
PGPKeyAccessDataFormat.SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_OPTION_IGNORE.
* `"no_signature_allowed"`: The PGP message must not contain a
signature; otherwise an exception (PGPException) is thrown. Use the
constant
PGPKeyAccessDataFormat.SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION_OPTION_NO_SIGNATURE_ALLOWED.

|`FileName` |`String` |`"_CONSOLE"` |*Since camel 2.15.0*: Sets the file name for the literal data packet.
Can be overwritten by the  header \{@link Exchange#FILE_NAME}.

"`_CONSOLE`" indicates that the message is considered to be "for your
eyes only". This advises that the message data is unusually sensitive,
and the receiving program should process it more carefully, perhaps
avoiding storing the received data to disk, for example.Only used for
marshaling.

|`withCompressedDataPacket` |boolean |`true` |*Since Camel 2.16.0*: Indicator whether the PGP Message shall be created
with or without a Compressed Data packet. If the value is set to false,
then no Compressed Data packet is added and the compressionAlgorithm
value is ignored. Only used for marshaling.

### Encrypting with PGPDataFormat

The following sample uses the popular PGP format for
encrypting/decrypting files using the
http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html[Bouncy Castle Java libraries]:

The following sample performs signing + encryption, and then signature
verification + decryption. It uses the same keyring for both signing and
encryption, but you can obviously use different keys:

Or using Spring:

#### To work with the previous example you need the following

* A public keyring file which contains the public keys used to encrypt
the data
* A private keyring file which contains the keys used to decrypt the
data
* The keyring password

#### Managing your keyring

To manage the keyring, I use the command line tools, I find this to be
the simplest approach in managing the keys. There are also Java
libraries available from
http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html[http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html]
if you would prefer to do it that way.

Install the command line utilities on linux

[source,java]
---------------------
apt-get install gnupg
---------------------
Create your keyring, entering a secure password

[source,java]
-------------
gpg --gen-key
-------------
If you need to import someone elses public key so that you can encrypt a file for them.

[source,java]
--------------------------
gpg --import <filename.key
--------------------------
The following files should now exist and can be used to run the example

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
ls -l ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg

[[Crypto-PGPDecrypting/VerifyingofMessagesEncrypted/SignedbyDifferentPrivate/PublicKeys]]
PGP Decrypting/Verifying of Messages Encrypted/Signed by Different
### Private/Public Keys

Since *Camel 2.12.2*.

A PGP Data Formater can decrypt/verify messages which have been
encrypted by different public keys or signed by different private keys.
Just, provide the corresponding private keys in the secret keyring, the
corresponding public keys in the public keyring, and the passphrases in
the passphrase accessor.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map<String, String> userId2Passphrase = new HashMap<String, String>(2);
// add passphrases of several private keys whose corresponding public keys have been used to encrypt the messages
userId2Passphrase.put("UserIdOfKey1","passphrase1"); // you must specify the exact User ID!
userId2Passphrase.put("UserIdOfKey2","passphrase2");
PGPPassphraseAccessor passphraseAccessor = new PGPPassphraseAccessorDefault(userId2Passphrase);

PGPDataFormat pgpVerifyAndDecrypt = new PGPDataFormat();
pgpVerifyAndDecrypt.setPassphraseAccessor(passphraseAccessor);
// the method getSecKeyRing() provides the secret keyring as byte array containing the private keys
pgpVerifyAndDecrypt.setEncryptionKeyRing(getSecKeyRing()); // alternatively you can use setKeyFileName(keyfileName)
// the method getPublicKeyRing() provides the public keyring as byte array containing the public keys
pgpVerifyAndDecrypt.setSignatureKeyRing((getPublicKeyRing());  // alternatively you can use setSignatureKeyFileName(signatgureKeyfileName)
// it is not necessary to specify the encryption or signer  User Id
 
from("direct:start")
         ...     
        .unmarshal(pgpVerifyAndDecrypt) // can decrypt/verify messages encrypted/signed by different private/public keys
        ...            
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The functionality is especially useful to support the key exchange. If
you want to exchange the private key for decrypting you can accept for a
period of time messages which are either encrypted with the old or new
corresponding public key. Or if the sender wants to exchange his signer
private key, you can accept for a period of time, the old or new signer
key.

Technical background: The PGP encrypted data contains a Key ID of the
public key which was used to encrypt the data. This Key ID can be used
to locate the private key in the secret keyring to decrypt the data. The
same mechanism is also used to locate the public key for verifying a
signature. Therefore you no longer must specify User IDs for the
unmarshaling.

### Restricting the Signer Identities during PGP Signature Verification

Since *Camel 2.12.3.*

If you verify a signature you not only want to verify the correctness of
the signature but you also want check that the signature comes from a
certain identity or a specific set of identities. Therefore it is
possible to restrict the number of public keys from the public keyring
which can be used for the verification of a signature.  

*Signature User IDs*

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// specify the User IDs of the expected signer identities
 List<String> expectedSigUserIds = new ArrayList<String>();
 expectedSigUserIds.add("Trusted company1");
 expectedSigUserIds.add("Trusted company2");
 
 PGPDataFormat pgpVerifyWithSpecificKeysAndDecrypt = new PGPDataFormat();
 pgpVerifyWithSpecificKeysAndDecrypt.setPassword("my password"); // for decrypting with private key
 pgpVerifyWithSpecificKeysAndDecrypt.setKeyFileName(keyfileName);
 pgpVerifyWithSpecificKeysAndDecrypt.setSignatureKeyFileName(signatgureKeyfileName);
 pgpVerifyWithSpecificKeysAndDecrypt.setSignatureKeyUserids(expectedSigUserIds); // if you have only one signer identity then you can also use setSignatureKeyUserid("expected Signer")
 
from("direct:start")
         ...     
        .unmarshal(pgpVerifyWithSpecificKeysAndDecrypt)
        ...      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* If the PGP content has several signatures the verification is
successful as soon as one signature can be verified.
* If you do not want to restrict the signer identities for verification
then do not specify the signature key User IDs. In this case all public
keys in the public keyring are taken into account.

### Several Signatures in One PGP Data Format

Since *Camel 2.12.3.*

The PGP specification allows that one PGP data format can contain
several signatures from different keys. Since Camel 2.13.3 it is
possible to create such kind of PGP content via specifying signature
User IDs which relate to several private keys in the secret keyring.

*Several Signatures*

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PGPDataFormat pgpSignAndEncryptSeveralSignerKeys = new PGPDataFormat();
 pgpSignAndEncryptSeveralSignerKeys.setKeyUserid(keyUserid); // for encrypting, you can also use setKeyUserids if you want to encrypt with several keys
 pgpSignAndEncryptSeveralSignerKeys.setKeyFileName(keyfileName);
 pgpSignAndEncryptSeveralSignerKeys.setSignatureKeyFileName(signatgureKeyfileName);
 pgpSignAndEncryptSeveralSignerKeys.setSignaturePassword("sdude"); // here we assume that all private keys have the same password, if this is not the case then you can use setPassphraseAccessor

 List<String> signerUserIds = new ArrayList<String>();
 signerUserIds.add("company old key");
 signerUserIds.add("company new key");
 pgpSignAndEncryptSeveralSignerKeys.setSignatureKeyUserids(signerUserIds);
 
from("direct:start")
         ...     
        .marshal(pgpSignAndEncryptSeveralSignerKeys)
        ...      
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Support of Sub-Keys and Key Flags in PGP Data Format Marshaler

Since *Camel 2.12.3. +
*An https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-12.1[OpenPGP V4 key] can
have a primary key and sub-keys. The usage of the keys is indicated by
the so called https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.21[Key
Flags]. For example, you can have a primary key with two sub-keys; the
primary key shall only be used for certifying other keys (Key Flag
0x01), the first sub-key  shall only be used for signing (Key Flag
0x02), and the second sub-key shall only be used for encryption (Key
Flag 0x04 or 0x08). The PGP Data Format marshaler takes into account
these Key Flags of the primary key and sub-keys in order to determine
the right key for signing and encryption. This is necessary because the
primary key and its sub-keys have the same User IDs.

### Support of Custom Key Accessors

Since *Camel 2.13.0. +
*You can implement custom key accessors for encryption/signing. The
above PGPDataFormat class selects in a certain predefined way the keys
which should be used for signing/encryption or verifying/decryption. If
you have special requirements how your keys should be selected you
should use the
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-crypto/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/crypto/PGPKeyAccessDataFormat.java[PGPKeyAccessDataFormat]
class instead and implement the interfaces
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-crypto/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/crypto/PGPPublicKeyAccessor.java[PGPPublicKeyAccessor]
and
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-crypto/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/crypto/PGPSecretKeyAccessor.java[PGPSecretKeyAccessor]
as beans. There are default implementations
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-crypto/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/crypto/DefaultPGPPublicKeyAccessor.java[DefaultPGPPublicKeyAccessor]
and
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-crypto/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/converter/crypto/DefaultPGPSecretKeyAccessor.java[DefaultPGPSecretKeyAccessor]
which cache the keys, so that not every time the keyring is parsed when
the processor is called.

PGPKeyAccessDataFormat has the same options as PGPDataFormat except
password, keyFileName, encryptionKeyRing, signaturePassword,
signatureKeyFileName, and signatureKeyRing.
