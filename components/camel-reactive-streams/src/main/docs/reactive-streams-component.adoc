*Since Camel {since}*

The Reactive Streams component allows you to exchange messages with reactive
stream processing libraries compatible with the
http://www.reactive-streams.org/[reactive streams] standard.

The component supports backpressure and has been tested using the https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/tree/master/tck[reactive streams technology
compatibility kit (TCK)].

The Camel module provides a *reactive-streams* component that allows users to define incoming and
outgoing streams within Camel routes, and a direct client API that allows using Camel endpoints
 directly into any external reactive framework.

Camel uses an internal implementation of the reactive streams
 _Publisher_ and _Subscriber_, so it's not tied to any specific framework.
The following reactive frameworks have been used in the integration tests: https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core[Reactor Core 3], https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-reactive-streams</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

-------------------------------------------------
reactive-streams://stream?[options]
-------------------------------------------------

Where *stream* is a logical stream name used to bind Camel routes to the
external stream processing systems.

== Usage

The library is aimed to support all the communication modes needed by an application to interact with Camel data:

* *Get* data from Camel routes (In-Only from Camel)
* *Send* data to Camel routes (In-Only towards Camel)
* *Request* a transformation to a Camel route (In-Out towards Camel)
* *Process* data flowing from a Camel route using a reactive processing step (In-Out from Camel)

== Getting data from Camel
In order to subscribe to data flowing from a Camel route, exchanges should be redirected to
a named stream, like in the following snippet:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("timer:clock")
.setBody().header(Exchange.TIMER_COUNTER)
.to("reactive-streams:numbers");
---------------------------------------------------------

Routes can also be written using the XML DSL.

In the example, an unbounded stream of numbers is associated to the name `numbers`.
The stream can be accessed using the `CamelReactiveStreams` utility class.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

// Getting a stream of exchanges
Publisher<Exchange> exchanges = camel.fromStream("numbers");

// Getting a stream of Integers (using Camel standard conversion system)
Publisher<Integer> numbers = camel.fromStream("numbers", Integer.class);
---------------------------------------------------------

The stream can be used easily with any reactive streams compatible library.
Here is an example of how to use it with https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2]
(although any reactive framework can be used to process events).

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
Flowable.fromPublisher(integers)
    .doOnNext(System.out::println)
    .subscribe();
---------------------------------------------------------

The example prints all numbers generated by Camel into `System.out`.

=== Getting data from Camel using the direct API

For short Camel routes and for users that prefer defining the whole processing flow
using functional constructs of the reactive framework (without using the Camel DSL at all),
streams can also be defined using Camel URIs.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

// Get a stream from all the files in a directory
Publisher<String> files = camel.from("file:folder", String.class);

// Use the stream in RxJava
Flowable.fromPublisher(files)
    .doOnNext(System.out::println)
    .subscribe();
---------------------------------------------------------

== Sending data to Camel
When an external library needs to push events into a Camel route, the Reactive Streams
endpoint must be set as consumer.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("reactive-streams:elements")
.to("log:INFO");
---------------------------------------------------------

A handle to the `elements` stream can be obtained from the `CamelReactiveStreams` utility class.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

Subscriber<String> elements = camel.streamSubscriber("elements", String.class);
---------------------------------------------------------

The subscriber can be used to push events to the Camel route that consumes from the `elements` stream.

Here is an example of how to use it with https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2]
(although any reactive framework can be used to publish events).

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
Flowable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
    .map(i -> "Item " + i)
    .subscribe(elements);
---------------------------------------------------------

String items are generated every second by RxJava in the example and they are pushed into the Camel route defined above.

=== Sending data to Camel using the direct API

Also in this case, the direct API can be used to obtain a Camel subscriber from an endpoint URI.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

// Send two strings to the "seda:queue" endpoint
Flowable.just("hello", "world")
    .subscribe(camel.subscriber("seda:queue", String.class));
---------------------------------------------------------

== Request a transformation to Camel

Routes defined in some Camel DSL can be used within a reactive stream framework to perform a
specific transformation (the same mechanism can be also used to eg. just send data to a _http_ endpoint and continue).

The following snippet shows how RxJava functional code can request the task of loading and marshalling files to Camel.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

// Process files starting from their names
Flowable.just(new File("file1.txt"), new File("file2.txt"))
    .flatMap(file -> camel.toStream("readAndMarshal", String.class))
    // Camel output will be converted to String
    // other steps
    .subscribe();
---------------------------------------------------------

In order this to work, a route like the following should be defined in the Camel context:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("reactive-streams:readAndMarshal")
.marshal() // ... other details
---------------------------------------------------------

=== Request a transformation to Camel using the direct API

An alternative approach consists in using the URI endpoints directly in the reactive flow:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

// Process files starting from their names
Flowable.just(new File("file1.txt"), new File("file2.txt"))
    .flatMap(file -> camel.to("direct:process", String.class))
    // Camel output will be converted to String
    // other steps
    .subscribe();
---------------------------------------------------------

When using the _to()_ method instead of the _toStream_, there is no need to define the
route using "reactive-streams:" endpoints (although they are used under the hood).

In this case, the Camel transformation can be just:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:process")
.marshal() // ... other details
---------------------------------------------------------


== Process Camel data into the reactive framework

While a reactive streams _Publisher_ allows exchanging data in a unidirectional way,
Camel routes often use a in-out exchange pattern (eg. to define REST endpoints and, in general,
where a reply is needed for each request).

In these circumstances, users can add a reactive processing step to the flow, to enhance a Camel route or to
define the entire transformation using the reactive framework.

For example, given the following route:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("timer:clock")
.setBody().header(Exchange.TIMER_COUNTER)
.to("direct:reactive")
.log("Continue with Camel route... n=${body}");
---------------------------------------------------------

A reactive processing step can be associated to the "direct:reactive" endpoint:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

camel.process("direct:reactive", Integer.class, items ->
    Flowable.fromPublisher(items) // RxJava
        .map(n -> -n)); // make every number negative
---------------------------------------------------------

Data flowing in the Camel route will be processed by the external reactive
framework then continue the processing flow inside Camel.

This mechanism can also be used to define a In-Out exchange in a completely
reactive way.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
CamelReactiveStreamsService camel = CamelReactiveStreams.get(context);

// requires a rest-capable Camel component
camel.process("rest:get:orders", exchange ->
                    Flowable.fromPublisher(exchange)
                            .flatMap(ex -> allOrders())); // retrieve orders asynchronously
---------------------------------------------------------

See Camel examples (*camel-example-reactive-streams*) for details.

== Advanced Topics
=== Controlling Backpressure (producer side)

When routing Camel exchanges to an external subscriber, backpressure is handled by an internal buffer that caches exchanges
before delivering them.
If the subscriber is slower than the exchange rate, the buffer may become too big. In many circumstances this must be avoided.

Considering the following route:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("jms:queue")
.to("reactive-streams:flow");
---------------------------------------------------------

If the JMS queue contains a high number of messages and the Subscriber associated with the `flow` stream is too slow,
messages are dequeued from JMS and appended to the buffer, possibly causing a "out of memory" error.
To avoid such problems, a `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` can be set in the route.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy policy = new ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy();
policy.setMaxInflightExchanges(10);

from("jms:queue")
.routePolicy(policy)
.to("reactive-streams:flow");
---------------------------------------------------------

The policy limits the maximum number of active exchanges (and so the maximum size of the buffer),
keeping it lower than the threshold (`10` in the example).
When more than `10` messages are in flight, the route is suspended, waiting for the subscriber to process them.

With this mechanism, the subscriber controls the route suspension/resume automatically, through backpressure.
When multiple subscribers are consuming items from the same stream, the slowest one controls the route status automatically.

In other circumstances, eg. when using a `http` consumer, the route suspension makes the http service unavailable, so
using the default configuration (no policy, unbounded buffer) should be preferable. Users should try to avoid memory issues
by limiting the number of requests to the http service (eg. scaling out).

In contexts where a certain amount of data loss is acceptable, setting a backpressure strategy other than `BUFFER` can
 be a solution for dealing with fast sources.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:thermostat")
.to("reactive-streams:flow?backpressureStrategy=LATEST");
---------------------------------------------------------

When the `LATEST` backpressure strategy is used, only the last exchange received from the route is kept by the publisher, while older data is discarded (other options are available).

=== Controlling Backpressure (consumer side)

When Camel consumes items from a reactive-streams publisher, the maximum number of inflight exchanges can be set as endpoint option.

The subscriber associated with the consumer interacts with the publisher to keep the number of messages in the route lower than the threshold.

An example of backpressure-aware route:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
from("reactive-streams:numbers?maxInflightExchanges=10")
.to("direct:endpoint");
---------------------------------------------------------

The number of items that Camel requests to the source publisher (through the reactive streams backpressure mechanism)
is always lower than `10`. Messages are processed by a single thread in the Camel side.

The number of concurrent consumers (threads) can also be set as endpoint option (`concurrentConsumers`).
When using 1 consumer (the default), the order of items in the source stream is maintained.
When this value is increased, items will be processed concurrently by multiple threads (so not preserving the order).
