The Kamelet Reify Component provides support for calling endpoints that are isolatated (a.k.a. _local mode_).
This is needed by Kamelets to ensure they are isolated and independent.

IMPORTANT: The *camel-kamelet-reify* component is becoming obsolete, as Kamelets (route templates) has support for local beans,
which is the recommended practice to use for building Kamelets that are isolated and independent.
Therefore this component is expected to become deprecated in the near future and removed later.

// endpoint options: START
// endpoint options: END

[NOTE]
====
The *kamelet-reify* endpoint is *lenient*, which means that the endpoint accepts additional parameters that are passed to the route template engine and consumed upon route materialization.
