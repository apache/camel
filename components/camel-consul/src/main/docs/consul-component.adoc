*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Consul component is a component for integrating your application with https://www.consul.io/[Hashicorp Consul].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-consul</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>

== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The Consul component supports 29 options, which are listed below.

| *writeTimeoutMillis* (common) | *Deprecated* Write timeout for OkHttpClient. Deprecation note: Use writeTimeout instead. Deprecation note: Use writeTimeout instead |  | Long
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *action* (producer) | The default action. Can be overridden by CamelConsulAction |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *valueAsString* (producer) | Default to transform values retrieved from Consul i.e. on KV endpoint to string. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean

== Producer Examples

As an example, we will show how to use the `ConsulAgentProducer` to register a service by means of the Consul agent api.

Registering and deregistering are examples for possible actions against the Consul agent api.

The desired action can be defined by setting the header `ConsulConstants.CONSUL_ACTION` to a value from the `ConsulXXXActions` interface of the respective Consul api. E.g.  `ConsulAgentActions` contains the actions for the agent api.

If you set `CONSUL_ACTION` to `ConsulAgentActions.REGISTER`, the agent action `REGISTER` will be executed.

TIP: Which producer action invokes which consul api is defined by the respective producer.
E.g. the `ConsulAgentProducer` maps `ConsulAgentActions.REGISTER` to an invocation of `AgentClient.register`.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:registerFooService")
    .setBody().constant(ImmutableRegistration.builder()
        .id("foo-1")
        .name("foo")
        .address("localhost")
        .port(80)
        .build())
    .setHeader(ConsulConstants.CONSUL_ACTION, constant(ConsulAgentActions.REGISTER))
    .to("consul:agent");
----

It is also possible to set a default action on the consul endpoint and do without the header:

----
consul:agent?action=REGISTER
----

== Registering Camel Routes with Consul

You can employ a `ServiceRegistrationRoutePolicy` to register Camel routes as services with Consul automatically.

[source,java]
----
from("jetty:http://0.0.0.0:8080/service/endpoint").routeId("foo-1")
    .routeProperty(ServiceDefinition.SERVICE_META_ID, "foo-1")
    .routeProperty(ServiceDefinition.SERVICE_META_NAME, "foo")
    .routePolicy(new ServiceRegistrationRoutePolicy())
...
