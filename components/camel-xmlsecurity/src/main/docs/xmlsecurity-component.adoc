== XML Security Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.12*

With this Apache Camel component, you can generate and validate XML
signatures as described in the W3C standard
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/[XML Signature Syntax and Processing]
or as described in the successor
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/[version 1.1]. For XML Encryption
support, please refer to the XML Security link:data-format.html[Data
Format].

You can find an introduction to XML signature
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/dig-signatures-141823.html[here].
The implementation of the component is based on
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/xmldsig/overview.html[JSR
105], the Java API corresponding to the W3C standard and supports the
Apache Santuario and the JDK provider for JSR 105. The implementation
will first try to use the Apache Santuario provider; if it does not find
the Santuario provider, it will use the JDK provider. Further, the
implementation is DOM based.

Since Camel 2.15.0 we also provide support for *XAdES-BES/EPES* for the
signer endpoint; see subsection "XAdES-BES/EPES for the Signer
Endpoint".

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-xmlsecurity</artifactId>

### XML Signature Wrapping Modes

XML Signature differs between enveloped, enveloping, and detached XML
signature. In the
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#def-SignatureEnveloped[enveloped]
XML signature case, the XML Signature is wrapped by the signed XML
Document; which means that the XML signature element is a child element
of a parent element, which belongs to the signed XML Document. In the
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#def-SignatureEnveloping[enveloping]
XML signature case, the XML Signature contains the signed content. All
other cases are called
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#def-SignatureDetached[detached] XML
signatures. A certain form of detached XML signature is supported since
**2.14.0**.

In the *enveloped XML signature* case, the supported generated XML
signature has the following structure (Variables are surrounded by `[]`).

[source,xml]
----
<[parent element]>
   ... <!-- Signature element is added as last child of the parent element-->
   <Signature Id="generated_unique_signature_id">
       <SignedInfo>
             <Reference URI="">
                   <Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature"/>
                   (<Transform>)* <!-- By default "http://www.w3.org/2006/12/xml-c14n11" is added to the transforms -->
                   <DigestMethod>
                   <DigestValue>
             </Reference>
             (<Reference URI="#[keyinfo_Id]">
                   <Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315"/>
                   <DigestMethod>
                   <DigestValue>
             </Reference>)?
             <!-- further references possible, see option 'properties' below -->
      </SignedInfo>
      <SignatureValue>
      (<KeyInfo Id="[keyinfo_id]">)?
      <!-- Object elements possible, see option 'properties' below -->
  </Signature>
</[parent element]>
----

In the *enveloping XML signature* case, the supported generated XML
signature has the structure:

[source,xml]
----
<Signature Id="generated_unique_signature_id">
  <SignedInfo>
         <Reference URI="#generated_unique_object_id" type="[optional_type_value]">
               (<Transform>)* <!-- By default "http://www.w3.org/2006/12/xml-c14n11" is added to the transforms -->
               <DigestMethod>
               <DigestValue>
         </Reference>
         (<Reference URI="#[keyinfo_id]">
               <Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315"/>
               <DigestMethod>
               <DigestValue>
         </Reference>)?
          <!-- further references possible, see option 'properties' below  -->
  </SignedInfo>
  <SignatureValue>
  (<KeyInfo Id="[keyinfo_id]">)?
  <Object Id="generated_unique_object_id"/> <!-- The Object element contains the in-message body; the object ID can either be generated or set by the option parameter "contentObjectId" -->
  <!-- Further Object elements possible, see option 'properties' below -->
</Signature>
----

As of 2.14.0 *detached XML signatures* with the following structure
are supported (see also sub-chapter XML Signatures as Siblings of Signed
Elements):

[source,xml]
----
(<[signed element] Id="[id_value]">
<!-- signed element must have an attribute of type ID -->
      ...

</[signed element]>
<other sibling/>* 
<!-- between the signed element and the corresponding signature element, there can be other siblings.
 Signature element is added as last sibling. -->
<Signature Id="generated_unique_ID">
   <SignedInfo>
      <CanonicalizationMethod>
      <SignatureMethod>
      <Reference URI="#[id_value]" type="[optional_type_value]">
      <!-- reference URI contains the ID attribute value of the signed element -->
            (<Transform>)* <!-- By default "http://www.w3.org/2006/12/xml-c14n11" is added to the transforms -->
            <DigestMethod>
            <DigestValue>
      </Reference>
      (<Reference URI="#[generated_keyinfo_Id]">
            <Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315"/>
            <DigestMethod>
            <DigestValue>
      </Reference>)?
   </SignedInfo>
   <SignatureValue>
   (<KeyInfo Id="[generated_keyinfo_id]">)?
</Signature>)+
----

 

### URI Format

The camel component consists of two endpoints which have the following
URI format:

[source]
----
xmlsecurity:sign:name[?options]
xmlsecurity:verify:name[?options]
----

* With the signer endpoint, you can generate a XML signature for the
body of the in-message which can be either a XML document or a plain
text. The enveloped, enveloping, or detached (as of 12.14)  XML
signature(s) will be set to the body of the out-message.
* With the verifier endpoint, you can validate an enveloped or
enveloping XML signature or even several detached (as of 2.14.0) XML
signatures contained in the body of the in-message; if the validation is
successful, then the original content is extracted from the XML
signature and set to the body of the out-message.
* The `name` part in the URI can be chosen by the user to distinguish
between different signer/verifier endpoints within the camel context.

### Basic Example

The following example shows the basic usage of the component.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:enveloping").to("xmlsecurity:sign://enveloping?keyAccessor=#accessor",
                             "xmlsecurity:verify://enveloping?keySelector=#selector",
                             "mock:result")
----

In Spring XML:

[source,xml]
----
<from uri="direct:enveloping" />
    <to uri="xmlsecurity:sign://enveloping?keyAccessor=#accessor" />
    <to uri="xmlsecurity:verify://enveloping?keySelector=#selector" />
<to uri="mock:result" />
----

For the signing process, a private key is necessary. You specify a key
accessor bean which provides this private key. For the validation, the
corresponding public key is necessary; you specify a key selector bean
which provides this public key.

The key accessor bean must implement the
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-xmlsecurity/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/xmlsecurity/api/KeyAccessor.java[`KeyAccessor`]
interface. The package `org.apache.camel.component.xmlsecurity.api`
contains the default implementation class
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-xmlsecurity/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/xmlsecurity/api/DefaultKeyAccessor.java[`DefaultKeyAccessor`]
which reads the private key from a Java keystore.

The key selector bean must implement the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/crypto/KeySelector.html[`javax.xml.crypto.KeySelector`]
interface. The package `org.apache.camel.component.xmlsecurity.api`
contains the default implementation class
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-xmlsecurity/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/xmlsecurity/api/DefaultKeySelector.java[`DefaultKeySelector`]
which reads the public key from a keystore.

In the example, the default signature algorithm
`http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1` is used. You can set the
signature algorithm of your choice by the option `signatureAlgorithm`
(see below). The signer endpoint creates an _enveloping_ XML signature.
If you want to create an _enveloped_ XML signature then you must specify
the parent element of the Signature element; see option
`parentLocalName` for more details.

For creating _detached_ XML signatures, see sub-chapter "Detached XML
Signatures as Siblings of the Signed Elements".

==== Query Parameters (35 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *baseUri* (common) | You can set a base URI which is used in the URI dereferencing. Relative URIs are then concatenated with the base URI. |  | String
| *clearHeaders* (common) | Determines if the XML signature specific headers be cleared after signing and verification. Defaults to true. | true | Boolean
| *cryptoContextProperties* (common) | Sets the crypto context properties. See {link XMLCryptoContext#setProperty(String, Object)}. Possible properties are defined in XMLSignContext an XMLValidateContext (see Supported Properties). The following properties are set by default to the value Boolean#TRUE for the XML validation. If you want to switch these features off you must set the property value to Boolean#FALSE. org.jcp.xml.dsig.validateManifests javax.xml.crypto.dsig.cacheReference |  | Map
| *disallowDoctypeDecl* (common) | Disallows that the incoming XML document contains DTD DOCTYPE declaration. The default value is Boolean#TRUE. | true | Boolean
| *omitXmlDeclaration* (common) | Indicator whether the XML declaration in the outgoing message body should be omitted. Default value is false. Can be overwritten by the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_OMIT_XML_DECLARATION. | false | Boolean
| *outputXmlEncoding* (common) | The character encoding of the resulting signed XML document. If null then the encoding of the original XML document is used. |  | String
| *schemaResourceUri* (common) | Classpath to the XML Schema. Must be specified in the detached XML Signature case for determining the ID attributes, might be set in the enveloped and enveloping case. If set, then the XML document is validated with the specified XML schema. The schema resource URI can be overwritten by the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_SCHEMA_RESOURCE_URI. |  | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *uriDereferencer* (advanced) | If you want to restrict the remote access via reference URIs, you can set an own dereferencer. Optional parameter. If not set the provider default dereferencer is used which can resolve URI fragments, HTTP, file and XPpointer URIs. Attention: The implementation is provider dependent! |  | URIDereferencer
| *addKeyInfoReference* (sign) | In order to protect the KeyInfo element from tampering you can add a reference to the signed info element so that it is protected via the signature value. The default value is true. Only relevant when a KeyInfo is returned by KeyAccessor. and KeyInfo#getId() is not null. | true | Boolean
| *canonicalizationMethod* (sign) | Canonicalization method used to canonicalize the SignedInfo element before the digest is calculated. You can use the helper methods XmlSignatureHelper.getCanonicalizationMethod(String algorithm) or getCanonicalizationMethod(String algorithm, List inclusiveNamespacePrefixes) to create a canonicalization method. | http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315 | AlgorithmMethod

| *contentReferenceType* (sign) | Type of the content reference. The default value is null. This value can be overwritten by the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_CONTENT_REFERENCE_TYPE. |  | String
| *contentReferenceUri* (sign) | Reference URI for the content to be signed. Only used in the enveloped case. If the reference URI contains an ID attribute value, then the resource schema URI ( setSchemaResourceUri(String)) must also be set because the schema validator will then find out which attributes are ID attributes. Will be ignored in the enveloping or detached case. |  | String
| *digestAlgorithm* (sign) | Digest algorithm URI. Optional parameter. This digest algorithm is used for calculating the digest of the input message. If this digest algorithm is not specified then the digest algorithm is calculated from the signature algorithm. Example: http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256 |  | String
| *keyAccessor* (sign) | For the signing process, a private key is necessary. You specify a key accessor bean which provides this private key. The key accessor bean must implement the KeyAccessor interface. The package org.apache.camel.component.xmlsecurity.api contains the default implementation class DefaultKeyAccessor which reads the private key from a Java keystore. |  | KeyAccessor
| *parentLocalName* (sign) | Local name of the parent element to which the XML signature element will be added. Only relevant for enveloped XML signature. Alternatively you can also use setParentXpath(XPathFilterParameterSpec). Default value is null. The value must be null for enveloping and detached XML signature. This parameter or the parameter setParentXpath(XPathFilterParameterSpec) for enveloped signature and the parameter setXpathsToIdAttributes(List) for detached signature must not be set in the same configuration. If the parameters parentXpath and parentLocalName are specified in the same configuration then an exception is thrown. |  | String
| *parentNamespace* (sign) | Namespace of the parent element to which the XML signature element will be added. |  | String
| *parentXpath* (sign) | Sets the XPath to find the parent node in the enveloped case. Either you specify the parent node via this method or the local name and namespace of the parent with the methods setParentLocalName(String) and setParentNamespace(String). Default value is null. The value must be null for enveloping and detached XML signature. If the parameters parentXpath and parentLocalName are specified in the same configuration then an exception is thrown. |  | XPathFilterParameter Spec
| *plainText* (sign) | Indicator whether the message body contains plain text. The default value is false, indicating that the message body contains XML. The value can be overwritten by the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_MESSAGE_IS_PLAIN_TEXT. | false | Boolean
| *plainTextEncoding* (sign) | Encoding of the plain text. Only relevant if the message body is plain text (see parameter plainText. Default value is UTF-8. | UTF-8 | String
| *prefixForXmlSignature Namespace* (sign) | Namespace prefix for the XML signature namespace http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#. Default value is ds. If null or an empty value is set then no prefix is used for the XML signature namespace. See best practice http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-bestpractices/#signing-xml- without-namespaces | ds | String
| *properties* (sign) | For adding additional References and Objects to the XML signature which contain additional properties, you can provide a bean which implements the XmlSignatureProperties interface. |  | XmlSignatureProperties
| *signatureAlgorithm* (sign) | Signature algorithm. Default value is http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1. | http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1 | String
| *signatureId* (sign) | Sets the signature Id. If this parameter is not set (null value) then a unique ID is generated for the signature ID (default). If this parameter is set to (empty string) then no Id attribute is created in the signature element. |  | String
| *transformMethods* (sign) | Transforms which are executed on the message body before the digest is calculated. By default, C14n is added and in the case of enveloped signature (see option parentLocalName) also http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature is added at position 0 of the list. Use methods in XmlSignatureHelper to create the transform methods. |  | List
| *xpathsToIdAttributes* (sign) | Define the elements which are signed in the detached case via XPATH expressions to ID attributes (attributes of type ID). For each element found via the XPATH expression a detached signature is created whose reference URI contains the corresponding attribute value (preceded by '#'). The signature becomes the last sibling of the signed element. Elements with deeper hierarchy level are signed first. You can also set the XPATH list dynamically via the header XmlSignatureConstants#HEADER_XPATHS_TO_ID_ATTRIBUTES. The parameter setParentLocalName(String) or setParentXpath(XPathFilterParameterSpec) for enveloped signature and this parameter for detached signature must not be set in the same configuration. |  | List
| *keySelector* (verify) | Provides the key for validating the XML signature. |  | KeySelector
| *outputNodeSearch* (verify) | Sets the output node search value for determining the node from the XML signature document which shall be set to the output message body. The class of the value depends on the type of the output node search. The output node search is forwarded to XmlSignature2Message. |  | String
| *outputNodeSearchType* (verify) | Determines the search type for determining the output node which is serialized into the output message bodyF. See setOutputNodeSearch(Object). The supported default search types you can find in DefaultXmlSignature2Message. | Default | String
| *removeSignatureElements* (verify) | Indicator whether the XML signature elements (elements with local name Signature and namesapce http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#) shall be removed from the document set to the output message. Normally, this is only necessary, if the XML signature is enveloped. The default value is Boolean#FALSE. This parameter is forwarded to XmlSignature2Message. This indicator has no effect if the output node search is of type DefaultXmlSignature2Message#OUTPUT_NODE_SEARCH_TYPE_DEFAULT.F | false | Boolean
| *secureValidation* (verify) | Enables secure validation. If true then secure validation is enabled. | true | Boolean
| *validationFailedHandler* (verify) | Handles the different validation failed situations. The default implementation throws specific exceptions for the different situations (All exceptions have the package name org.apache.camel.component.xmlsecurity.api and are a sub-class of XmlSignatureInvalidException. If the signature value validation fails, a XmlSignatureInvalidValueException is thrown. If a reference validation fails, a XmlSignatureInvalidContentHashException is thrown. For more detailed information, see the JavaDoc. |  | ValidationFailedHandler
| *xmlSignature2Message* (verify) | Bean which maps the XML signature to the output-message after the validation. How this mapping should be done can be configured by the options outputNodeSearchType, outputNodeSearch, and removeSignatureElements. The default implementation offers three possibilities which are related to the three output node search types Default, ElementName, and XPath. The default implementation determines a node which is then serialized and set to the body of the output message If the search type is ElementName then the output node (which must be in this case an element) is determined by the local name and namespace defined in the search value (see option outputNodeSearch). If the search type is XPath then the output node is determined by the XPath specified in the search value (in this case the output node can be of type Element, TextNode or Document). If the output node search type is Default then the following rules apply: In the enveloped XML signature case (there is a reference with URI= and transform http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature), the incoming XML document without the Signature element is set to the output message body. In the non-enveloped XML signature case, the message body is determined from a referenced Object; this is explained in more detail in chapter Output Node Determination in Enveloping XML Signature Case. |  | XmlSignature2Message
| *xmlSignatureChecker* (verify) | This interface allows the application to check the XML signature before the validation is executed. This step is recommended in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-bestpractices/#check-what-is-signed |  | XmlSignatureChecker

The default implementation determines a node which is then serialized and set to the body of the output message If the search type is "ElementName" then the output node (which must be in this case an element) is determined by the local name and namespace defined in the search value (see option outputNodeSearch). If the search type is "XPath" then the output node is determined by the XPath specified in the search value (in this case the output node can be of type "Element", "TextNode" or "Document"). If the output node search type is "Default" then the following rules apply: In the enveloped XML signature case (there is a reference with URI="" and transform "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature"), the incoming XML document without the Signature element is set to the output message body.

#### Output Node Determination in Enveloping XML Signature Case

After the validation the node is extracted from the XML signature
document which is finally returned to the output-message body. In the
enveloping XML signature case, the default implementation
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-xmlsecurity/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/xmlsecurity/api/DefaultXmlSignature2Message.java[`DefaultXmlSignature2Message`]
of
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-xmlsecurity/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/xmlsecurity/api/XmlSignature2Message.java[`XmlSignature2Message`]
does this for the node search type `Default` in the following way (see
option `xmlSignature2Message`):

* First an object reference is determined:

** Only same document references are taken into account (URI must start
with `#`)
** Also indirect same document references to an object via manifest are
taken into account.
** The resulting number of object references must be 1.

* Then, the object is dereferenced and the object must only contain one
XML element. This element is returned as output node.

This does mean that the enveloping XML signature must have either the
structure:

[source,xml]
----
<Signature>
      <SignedInfo>
         <Reference URI="#object"/>
         <!-- further references possible but they must not point to an Object or Manifest containing an object reference -->
         ...
      </SignedInfo>

      <Object Id="object">
           <!-- contains one XML element which is extracted to the message body -->
      <Object>
      <!-- further object elements possible which are not referenced-->
      ...
      (<KeyInfo>)?
</Signature>
----

or the structure:

[source,xml]
----
<Signature>
      <SignedInfo>
         <Reference URI="#manifest"/>
         <!-- further references  are possible but they must not point to an Object or other manifest containing an object reference -->
         ...
      </SignedInfo>

      <Object >
         <Manifest Id="manifest">
            <Reference URI=#object/>
         </Manifest>
      </Objet>
      <Object Id="object">
          <!-- contains the DOM node which is extracted to the message body -->
      </Object>
       <!-- further object elements possible which are not referenced -->
      ...
      (<KeyInfo>)?
</Signature>
----

### Detached XML Signatures as Siblings of the Signed Elements

**Since 2.14.0**

You can create detached signatures where the signature is a sibling of
the signed element. The following example contains two detached
signatures. The first signature is for the element `C` and the second
signature is for element `A`. The signatures are _nested_; the second
signature is for the element `A` which also contains the first signature.

The example shows that you can sign several elements and that for each
element a signature is created as sibling. The elements to be signed
must have an attribute of type ID. The ID type of the attribute must be
defined in the XML schema (see option `schemaResourceUri`). You
specify a list of XPATH expressions pointing to attributes of type ID
(see option `xpathsToIdAttributes`). These attributes determine the
elements to be signed. The elements are signed by the same key given by
the `keyAccessor` bean. Elements with higher (i.e. deeper) hierarchy level
are signed first. In the example, the element `C` is signed before the
element `A`.

### XAdES-BES/EPES for the Signer Endpoint

*Available as of Camel 2.15.0* 

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101900_101999/101903/01.04.02_60/ts_101903v010402p.pdf[XML
Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)] defines extensions to XML
Signature. This standard was defined by the
http://www.etsi.org/[European Telecommunication Standards Institute] and
allows you to create signatures which are compliant to the
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:013:0012:0020:EN:PDF[European
Union Directive (1999/93/EC) on a Community framework for electronic
signatures]. XAdES defines different sets of signature properties which
are called signature forms. We support the signature forms *Basic
Electronic Signature* (XAdES-BES) and *Explicit Policy Based Electronic
Signature* (XAdES-EPES) for the Signer Endpoint. The forms
**Electronic ****Signature with Validation Data** XAdES-T and XAdES-C
are not supported.


We support the following properties of the XAdES-EPES form ("?" denotes
zero or one occurrence):


*Supported XAdES-EPES Properties*

<QualifyingProperties Target>
    <SignedProperties>
        <SignedSignatureProperties>

            (SigningCertificate)?

    </SignedProperties>
</QualifyingProperties>
----

The properties of the XAdES-BES form are the same except that
the `SignaturePolicyIdentifier` property is not part of XAdES-BES. 

You can configure the XAdES-BES/EPES properties via the
bean `org.apache.camel.component.xmlsecurity.api.XAdESSignatureProperties`
or `org.apache.camel.component.xmlsecurity.api.DefaultXAdESSignatureProperties. XAdESSignatureProperties` does
support all properties mentioned above except
the `SigningCertificate` property. To get
the `SigningCertificate` property, you must overwrite either the
method `XAdESSignatureProperties.getSigningCertificate()` or `XAdESSignatureProperties.getSigningCertificateChain()`. The
class `DefaultXAdESSignatureProperties` overwrites the
method `getSigningCertificate()` and allows you to specify the signing
certificate via a keystore and alias. The following example shows all
parameters you can specify. If you do not need certain parameters you
can just omit them.

#### Headers

[width="100%",cols="1m,1m,4",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description
|CamelXmlSignatureXAdESQualifyingPropertiesId |String |for the 'Id'
attribute value of `QualifyingProperties` element

|CamelXmlSignatureXAdESSignedDataObjectPropertiesId |String |for the
'Id' attribute value of `SignedDataObjectProperties` element

|CamelXmlSignatureXAdESSignedSignaturePropertiesId |String |for the
'Id' attribute value of `SignedSignatureProperties` element

|CamelXmlSignatureXAdESDataObjectFormatEncoding |String |for the value
of the Encoding element of the `DataObjectFormat` element

|CamelXmlSignatureXAdESNamespace |String | overwrites the XAdES
namespace parameter value

|CamelXmlSignatureXAdESPrefix |String |overwrites the XAdES prefix
parameter value
|=======================================================================

#### Limitations with regard to XAdES version 1.4.2

* No support for signature form XAdES-T and XAdES-C
* Only signer part implemented. Verifier part currently not available.
* No support for the `QualifyingPropertiesReference` element (see
section 6.3.2 of spec).
* No support for the `Transforms` element contained in
the `SignaturePolicyId` element contained in
the `SignaturePolicyIdentifier element`
* No support of the `CounterSignature` element -> no support for
the `UnsignedProperties` element
* At most one `DataObjectFormat` element. More than one
`DataObjectFormat` element makes no sense because we have only one data
object which is signed (this is the incoming message body to the XML
signer endpoint).
* At most one `CommitmentTypeIndication` element. More than one
`CommitmentTypeIndication` element makes no sense  because we have only
one data object which is signed (this is the incoming message body to
the XML signer endpoint).
* A `CommitmentTypeIndication` element contains always the
`AllSignedDataObjects` element. The `ObjectReference` element within
`CommitmentTypeIndication` element is not supported.
* The `AllDataObjectsTimeStamp` element is not supported
* The `IndividualDataObjectsTimeStamp` element is not supported
