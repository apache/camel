/**
 * Handler for handling the case when the core signature validation fails or a
 * {@link XMLSignatureException} occurs during calling
 * {@link XMLSignature#validate(javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLValidateContext)}.
 * 
 * This handler can be used to react in a specific way on validation failures.
 * For example, the handler could write logs or may even ignore certain
 * validation failures.
 * <p>
 * Typically the handler throws an exception when a validation failure occurs.
 * 
 * There is a certain order how the methods are called.
 * <ul>
 * <li>First, the method {@link #start()} is called when a core validation
 * fails.
 * <li>Then {@link #signatureValueValidationFailed(SignatureValue)} is called if
 * the signature validation fails.
 * <li>Then, for each reference in the signed info whose validation fails
 * {@link #referenceValidationFailed(Reference)} is called.
 * <li>Then, for each reference in the manifests whose validation fails, the
 * method {@link #manifestReferenceValidationFailed(Reference)} is called.
 * <li>Then, the method {@link #ignoreCoreValidationFailure()} is called where
 * you can finally decide whether the processing should go on or be interrupted.
 * <li>It is ensured that the method {@link #end()} is called at the end of the
 * validation, even if the methods called before have thrown an exception. This
 * allows you to hold state between the start and end of the validation handling
 * process.
 * </ul>
 * If you throw an exception then the validation checking is interrupted and
 * after that only the {@link #end()} method is called in a finally block. Best
 * practice is to interrupt the validation at the first occurrence of a
 * validation error.
