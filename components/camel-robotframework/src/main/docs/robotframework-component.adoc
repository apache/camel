= Robot Framework Component

*Since Camel 3.0*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END


The *robotframework:* component allows for processing camel exchanges
in acceptence test suites which are already implemented with its own DSL. 
The depending keyword libraries that can be used inside test suites 
implemented in Robot DSL, could have been implemented either via 
Java or Pyhton.

This component will let you execute business logic of acceptence test cases 
in Robot language on which you can pass parameters to feed data via power 
of Camel Routes, however there is no reverse binding of parameters back where
you can pass values back into Camel exchange. Therefore, for that reason,
it actually acts like a template language passing camel exchanges by binding
data into the test cases implemented.

== URI format

[source,text]
----
robotframework:templateName[?options]
----

Where *templateName* is the classpath-local URI of the template to
invoke; or the complete URL of the remote template (eg:
\file://folder/myfile.robot).

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

=== Options

// component options: START
The Robot Framework component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (advanced) | The configuration |  | RobotFrameworkCamelConfiguration
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Robot Framework endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
robotframework:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* Path to the resource. You can prefix with: classpath, file, http, ref, or bean. classpath, file and http loads the resource using these protocols (classpath is default). ref will lookup the resource in the registry. bean will call a method on a bean to be used as the resource. For bean you can specify the method name after dot, eg bean:myBean.myMethod. |  | String

=== Samples

For example you could use something like:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:setVariableCamelBody")
    .to("robotframework:src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/robotframework/set_variable_camel_body.robot")
----

To use a robot test case to execute and collect the results
and pass them to generate custom report if such need happens

It's possible to specify what template the component
should use dynamically via a header, so for example:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

Robotframework component helps you pass values into robot test cases 
with the similar approach how you would be able to pass values using 
Camel Simple Language. Components supports passing values in three
different ways. Exchange body, headers and properties.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setBody(constant("Hello Robot"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

And the `template.robot` file:

[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Body Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${body}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${body}
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setHeader("testHeader", constant("testHeaderValue"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

And the `template.robot` file:

[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${headers.testHeader}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${headers.testHeader}
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setProperty"testProperty", constant("testPropertyValue"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

And the `template.robot` file:
[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${properties.testProperty}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${properties.testProperty}
----

Please note that when you pass values through Camel Exchange to test cases,
they will be available as case-sensitive ``body``, ``headers.[yourHeaderName]`` and ``properties.[yourPropertyName]``
