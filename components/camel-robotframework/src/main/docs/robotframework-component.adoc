= Robot Framework Component

*Since Camel 3.0*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END


The *robotframework:* component allows for processing camel exchanges
in acceptence test suites which are already implemented with its own DSL. 
The depending keyword libraries that can be used inside test suites 
implemented in Robot DSL, could have been implemented either via 
Java or Pyhton.

This component will let you execute business logic of acceptence test cases 
in Robot language on which you can pass parameters to feed data via power 
of Camel Routes, however there is no reverse binding of parameters back where
you can pass values back into Camel exchange. Therefore, for that reason,
it actually acts like a template language passing camel exchanges by binding
data into the test cases implemented.

robotframework:templateName[?options]
----

Where *templateName* is the classpath-local URI of the template to
invoke; or the complete URL of the remote template (eg:
\file://folder/myfile.robot).

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

=== Options

// component options: START
The Robot Framework component supports 49 options, which are listed below.

=== Samples

For example you could use something like:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:setVariableCamelBody")
    .to("robotframework:src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/robotframework/set_variable_camel_body.robot")
----

To use a robot test case to execute and collect the results
and pass them to generate custom report if such need happens

It's possible to specify what template the component
should use dynamically via a header, so for example:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

Robotframework component helps you pass values into robot test cases 
with the similar approach how you would be able to pass values using 
Camel Simple Language. Components supports passing values in three
different ways. Exchange body, headers and properties.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setBody(constant("Hello Robot"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

And the `template.robot` file:

[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Body Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${body}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${body}
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setHeader("testHeader", constant("testHeaderValue"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

And the `template.robot` file:

[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${headers.testHeader}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${headers.testHeader}
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setProperty"testProperty", constant("testPropertyValue"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy");
----

And the `template.robot` file:
[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${properties.testProperty}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${properties.testProperty}
----

Please note that when you pass values through Camel Exchange to test cases,
they will be available as case-sensitive ``body``, ``headers.[yourHeaderName]`` and ``properties.[yourPropertyName]``
