*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*


The *robotframework:* component allows for processing camel exchanges
in acceptence test suites which are already implemented with its own DSL. 
The depending keyword libraries that can be used inside test suites 
implemented in Robot DSL, could have been implemented either via 
Java or Pyhton.

This component will let you execute business logic of acceptence test cases 
in Robot language on which you can pass parameters to feed data via power 
of Camel Routes, however there is no reverse binding of parameters back where
you can pass values back into Camel exchange. Therefore, for that reason,
it actually acts like a template language passing camel exchanges by binding
data into the test cases implemented.

== URI format

robotframework:templateName[?options]

Where *templateName* is the classpath-local URI of the template to
invoke; or the complete URL of the remote template (eg:
\file://folder/myfile.robot).

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

=== Options

// component options: START
The Robot Framework component supports 51 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *allowContextMapAll* (common) | Sets whether the context map should allow access to all details. By default only the message body and headers can be accessed. This option can be enabled for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext. Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API. | false | boolean
| *allowTemplateFromHeader* (common) | Whether to allow to use resource template from header or not (default false). Enabling this allows to specify dynamic templates via message header. However this can be seen as a potential security vulnerability if the header is coming from a malicious user, so use this with care. | false | boolean
| *argumentFile* (common) | A text file to read more arguments from. |  | File
| *combinedTagStats* (common) | Creates combined statistics based on tags. Use the format tags:title List |  | String

| *monitorWidth* (common) | Width of the monitor output. Default is 78. | 78 | String
| *name* (common) | Sets the name of the top-level tests suites. |  | String
| *nonCriticalTags* (common) | Tests that have the given tags are not critical. List |  | String

| *outputDirectory* (common) | Configures where generated reports are to be placed. |  | File
| *randomize* (common) | Sets the test execution order to be randomized. Valid values are all, suite, and test |  | String
| *report* (common) | Sets the path to the generated report file. |  | File
| *reportBackground* (common) | Sets background colors for the generated report and summary. |  | String
| *reportTitle* (common) | Sets a title for the generated tests report. |  | String

| *runFailed* (common) | Re-run failed tests, based on output.xml file. |  | File
| *runMode* (common) | Sets the execution mode for this tests run. Note that this setting has been deprecated in Robot Framework 2.8. Use separate dryryn, skipTeardownOnExit, exitOnFailure, and randomize settings instead. |  | String

| *splitOutputs* (common) | Splits output and log files. |  | String
| *suites* (common) | Selects the tests suites by name. List |  | String
| *suiteStatLevel* (common) | Defines how many levels to show in the Statistics by Suite table in outputs. |  | String
| *summaryTitle* (common) | Sets a title for the generated summary report. |  | String
| *tagDocs* (common) | Adds documentation to the specified tags. List |  | String

| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | The configuration |  | RobotFrameworkCamelConfiguration

=== Samples

For example you could use something like:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:setVariableCamelBody")
    .to("robotframework:src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/robotframework/set_variable_camel_body.robot")
----

To use a robot test case to execute and collect the results
and pass them to generate custom report if such need happens

It's possible to specify what template the component
should use dynamically via a header, so for example:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy?allowTemplateFromHeader=true");
----

Robotframework component helps you pass values into robot test cases 
with the similar approach how you would be able to pass values using 
Camel Simple Language. Components supports passing values in three
different ways. Exchange body, headers and properties.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setBody(constant("Hello Robot"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy?allowTemplateFromHeader=true");
----

And the `template.robot` file:

[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Body Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${body}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${body}
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setHeader("testHeader", constant("testHeaderValue"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy?allowTemplateFromHeader=true");
----

And the `template.robot` file:

[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${headers.testHeader}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${headers.testHeader}
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in")
    .setProperty"testProperty", constant("testPropertyValue"))
    .setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot")
    .to("robotframework:dummy?allowTemplateFromHeader=true");
----

And the `template.robot` file:
[source,text]
----
    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${properties.testProperty}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${properties.testProperty}
----

Please note that when you pass values through Camel Exchange to test cases,
they will be available as case-sensitive ``body``, ``headers.[yourHeaderName]`` and ``properties.[yourPropertyName]``
