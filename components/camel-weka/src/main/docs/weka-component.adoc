= Weka Component

*Since Camel 3.0.2*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Weka component provides access to the https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka[(Weka Data Mining)] toolset.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-weka</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------

== Options

// component options: START
The Weka component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The Weka endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
weka:cmd
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *filter* | The filter command |  | String
| *version* | The version command |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (5 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apply* (producer) | The Weka filter/classifier spec (i.e. Name Options) |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *path* (producer) | An optional in/out path for the read/write commands |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-weka-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.weka.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.weka.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.weka.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the weka component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.weka.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean

== Samples

This first example shows how to read a CSV file with the file component and then 
pass it on to Weka. In Weka we apply a few filters to the data set and then pass it on to
the file component for writing. 

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        
        // Use the file component to read the CSV file
        from("file:src/test/resources/data?fileName=sfny.csv&noop=true")
        
        // Convert the 'in_sf' attribute to nominal
        .to("weka:filter?apply=NumericToNominal -R first")
        
        // Move the 'in_sf' attribute to the end
        .to("weka:filter?apply=Reorder -R 2-last,1")
        
        // Rename the relation
        .to("weka:filter?apply=RenameRelation -modify sfny")
        
        // Use the file component to write the Arff file
        .to("file:target/data?fileName=sfny.arff")
        
        .to("direct:end");
    }
----

The second example does the same as above without use of the file component.

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        
        from("direct:start")
        
        // Use Weka to read the CSV file
        .to("weka:read?path=src/test/resources/data/sfny.csv")
        
        // Convert the 'in_sf' attribute to nominal
        .to("weka:filter?apply=NumericToNominal -R first")
        
        // Move the 'in_sf' attribute to the end
        .to("weka:filter?apply=Reorder -R 2-last,1")
        
        // Rename the relation
        .to("weka:filter?apply=RenameRelation -modify sfny")
        
        // Use Weka to write the Arff file
        .to("weka:write?path=target/data/sfny.arff");
    }
