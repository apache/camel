== JavaSpace Component (deprecated)

*Available as of Camel version 2.1*

The *javaspace* component is a transport for working with any JavaSpace
compliant implementation and this component has been tested with both
the http://www.dancres.org/blitz/[Blitz implementation] and the
http://www.gigaspaces.com/[GigaSpace implementation]. +
 This component can be used for sending and receiving any object
inheriting from the Jini `net.jini.core.entry.Entry` class. It is also
possible to pass the bean ID of a template that can be used for
reading/taking the entries from the space. +
 This component can be used for sending/receiving any serializable
object acting as a sort of generic transport. The JavaSpace component
contains a special optimization for dealing with the `BeanExchange`. It
can be used to invoke a POJO remotely, using a JavaSpace as a
transport. +
 This latter feature can provide a simple implementation of the
master/worker pattern, where a POJO provides the business logic for the
worker. +
 Look at the test cases for examples of various use cases for this
component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-javaspace</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------
javaspace:jini://host[?options]
-------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options


// component options: START
The JavaSpace component has no options.
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The JavaSpace endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
javaspace:url
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *url* | *Required* The URL to the JavaSpace server |  | String
|===

==== Query Parameters (10 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *spaceName* (common) | *Required* Specifies the JavaSpace name. |  | String
| *transactional* (common) | If true sending and receiving entries is performed within a transaction. | false | boolean
| *transactionTimeout* (common) | Specifies the transaction timeout in millis. By default there is no timeout. |  | long
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *concurrentConsumers* (consumer) | Specifies the number of concurrent consumers getting entries from the JavaSpace. | 1 | int
| *templateId* (consumer) | If present this option specifies the Spring bean ID of the template to use for reading/taking entries. |  | String
| *verb* (consumer) | Specifies the verb for getting JavaSpace entries. | take | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END



### Examples

#### Sending and Receiving Entries

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// sending route
from("direct:input")
    .to("javaspace:jini://localhost?spaceName=mySpace");

// receiving Route
from("javaspace:jini://localhost?spaceName=mySpace&templateId=template&verb=take&concurrentConsumers=1")
    .to("mock:foo");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case the payload can be any object that inherits from the Jini
`Entry` type.

#### Sending and receiving serializable objects

Using the preceding routes, it is also possible to send and receive any
serializable object. The JavaSpace component detects that the payload is
not a Jini `Entry` and then it automatically wraps the payload with a
Camel Jini `Entry`. In this way, a JavaSpace can be used as a generic
transport mechanism.

#### Using JavaSpace as a remote invocation transport

The JavaSpace component has been tailored to work in combination with
the Camel bean component. It is therefore possible to call a remote POJO
using JavaSpace as the transport:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// client side
from("direct:input")
    .to("javaspace:jini://localhost?spaceName=mySpace");

// server side
from("javaspace:jini://localhost?concurrentConsumers=10&spaceName=mySpace")
    .to("mock:foo");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the code there are two test cases showing how to use a POJO to
realize the master/worker pattern. The idea is to use the POJO to
provide the business logic and rely on Camel for sending/receiving
requests/replies with the proper correlation.
