*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The VM component provides asynchronous
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture[SEDA] behavior, exchanging
messages on a
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html[BlockingQueue]
and invoking consumers in a separate thread pool.

This component differs from the xref:seda-component.adoc[Seda] component in that
VM supports communication across CamelContext instances - so you can use
this mechanism to communicate across web applications (provided that
`camel-core.jar` is on the `system/boot` classpath).

VM is an extension to the xref:seda-component.adoc[Seda] component.

== URI format

----
vm:queueName[?options]
----

Where *`queueName`* can be any string to uniquely identify the endpoint
within the JVM (or at least within the classloader that loaded
camel-core.jar)

It is sufficient to list all the options for a consumer endpoint only.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:foo").to("vm:bar");

from("vm:bar?concurrentConsumers=5").to("file://output");
----



// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END



See the xref:seda-component.adoc[Seda] component for options and other important
usage details as the same rules apply to the xref:vm-component.adoc[Vm] component.

== Samples

In the route below we send exchanges across CamelContext instances to a
VM queue named `order.email`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in").bean(MyOrderBean.class).to("vm:order.email");
----

And then we receive exchanges in some other Camel context (such as
deployed in another `.war` application):

[source,java]
----
from("vm:order.email").bean(MyOrderEmailSender.class);
----
