== Elastichsearch5 Rest Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.21*

The ElasticSearch component allows you to interface with an
https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[ElasticSearch] 5.x API using the REST Client library.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-elasticsearch5</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

=== Endpoint Options

// component options: START
The Elastichsearch5 Rest component supports 12 options which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *client* (advanced) | To use an existing configured Elasticsearch client instead of creating a client per endpoint. This allow to customize the client with specific settings. |  | RestClient
| *hostAddresses* (advanced) | Comma separated list with ip:port formatted remote transport addresses to use. The ip and port options must be left blank for hostAddresses to be considered instead. |  | String
| *socketTimeout* (advanced) | The timeout in ms to wait before the socket will timeout. | 30000 | int
| *connectionTimeout* (advanced) | The time in ms to wait before connection will timeout. | 30000 | int
| *user* (advance) | Basic authenticate user |  | String
| *password* (producer) | Password for authenticate |  | String
| *enableSSL* (advanced) | Enable SSL | false | Boolean
| *maxRetryTimeout* (advanced) | The time in ms before retry | 30000 | int
| *enableSniffer* (advanced) | Enable automatically discover nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster | false | Boolean
| *snifferInterval* (advanced) | The interval between consecutive ordinary sniff executions in milliseconds. Will be honoured when sniffOnFailure is disabled or when there are no failures between consecutive sniff executions | 300000 | int
| *sniffAfterFailureDelay* (advanced) | The delay of a sniff execution scheduled after a failure (in milliseconds) | 60000 | int
| *resolveProperty Placeholders* (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean

=== Message Operations

The following ElasticSearch operations are currently supported. Simply
set an endpoint URI option or exchange header with a key of "operation"
and a value set to one of the following. Some operations also require
other parameters or the message body to be set.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|operation |message body |description

|INDEX |Map, String, byte[] or XContentBuilder content to index |Adds content to an index and returns the content's indexId in the body.
You can set the indexId by setting the message header with
the key "indexId".

|GET_BY_ID |index id of content to retrieve |Retrieves the specified index and returns a GetResult object in the body

|DELETE |index name and type of content to delete |Deletes the specified indexName and indexType and returns a DeleteResponse object in the
body

|DELETE_INDEX |index name of content to delete |Deletes the specified indexName and returns a DeleteIndexResponse object in the
body

|BULK_INDEX | a *List* or *Collection* of any type that is already accepted
(XContentBuilder, Map, byte[], String) |Adds content to an index and return a List of the id of the
successfully indexed documents in the body

|BULK |a *List* or *Collection* of any type that is already accepted
(XContentBuilder, Map, byte[], String) |Adds content to an index and returns the BulkResponse
object in the body

|SEARCH |Map, String or SearchRequest Object |Search the content with the map of query string

|MULTIGET |List of MultigetRequest.Item object |Retrieves the specified indexes, types etc. in
MultigetRequest and returns a MultigetResponse object in the body

|MULTISEARCH |List of SearchRequest object |Search for parameters specified in MultiSearchRequest and
returns a MultiSearchResponse object in the body

|EXISTS |Index name as header |Checks the index exists or not and returns a Boolean flag in the body

|UPDATE |Map, String, byte[] or XContentBuilder content to update |Updates content to an index and returns the content's
indexId in the body.

=== Index Example

Below is a simple INDEX example

[source,java]
----
from("direct:index")
  .to("elasticsearch5-rest://elasticsearch?operation=INDEX&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet");
----

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:index" />
    <to uri="elasticsearch5-rest://elasticsearch?operation=INDEX&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet"/>
</route>
----

A client would simply need to pass a body message containing a Map to
the route. The result body contains the indexId created.

[source,java]
----
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
map.put("content", "test");
String indexId = template.requestBody("direct:index", map, String.class);
