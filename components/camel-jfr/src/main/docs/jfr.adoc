*Since Camel {since}*

The Camel Java Flight Recorder (JFR) component is used for integrating Camel with Java Flight Recorder (JFR).

This allows to monitor and troubleshoot your Camel applications with JFR.

The camel-jfr component emits lifecycle events for startup to JFR.
This can for example be used to pin-point which Camel routes may be slow to startup.
