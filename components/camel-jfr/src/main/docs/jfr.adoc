*Since Camel {since}*

The Camel Java Flight Recorder (JFR) component is used for integrating Camel with Java Flight Recorder (JFR).

This allows to monitor and troubleshoot your Camel applications with JFR.

The camel-jfr component emits lifecycle events for startup to JFR.
This can for example be used to pin-point which Camel routes may be slow to startup.

[[jfr-Options]]

See the __startupRecorder__ options from xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main]

[[jfr-Example]]
== Example

To enable you just need to add `camel-jfr` to the classpath, and enable JFR recording.

JFR recordings can be started either at:
- When running the JVM using JVM arguments
- When starting Camel by setting `camel.main.startup-recorder-recording=true`.

See the `camel-example-flight-recorder` from the Camel Examples.
