*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The REST component allows to define REST endpoints (consumer) using the
Rest DSL and plugin to other Camel components as the
REST transport.

The rest component can also be used as a client (producer) to call REST services.

== URI format

----
rest://method:path[:uriTemplate]?[options]
----

// component-configure options: START

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START

// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END
// component headers: START

// component headers: END

== Supported rest components

The following components support rest consumer (Rest DSL):

* camel-netty-http
* camel-jetty
* camel-servlet
* camel-undertow

The following components support rest producer:

* camel-http
* camel-netty-http
* camel-undertow
* camel-vertx-http

== Path and uriTemplate syntax

The path and uriTemplate option is defined using a REST syntax where you
define the REST context path using support for parameters. 

[TIP]
====
If no uriTemplate is configured then path option works the same way. It
does not matter if you configure only path or if you configure both
options. Though configuring both a path and uriTemplate is a more common
practice with REST.
====


The following is a Camel route using a path only

[source,java]
----
from("rest:get:hello")
  .transform().constant("Bye World");
----

And the following route uses a parameter which is mapped to a Camel
header with the key "me".

[source,java]
----
from("rest:get:hello/{me}")
  .transform().simple("Bye ${header.me}");
----

The following examples have configured a base path as "hello" and then
have two REST services configured using uriTemplates.

[source,java]
----
from("rest:get:hello:/{me}")
  .transform().simple("Hi ${header.me}");

from("rest:get:hello:/french/{me}")
  .transform().simple("Bonjour ${header.me}");
----

== Rest producer examples

You can use the rest component to call REST services like any other Camel component.

For example to call a REST service on using `hello/\{me}` you can do

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .to("rest:get:hello/{me}");
----

And then the dynamic value `\{me}` is mapped to Camel message with the same name.
So to call this REST service you can send an empty message body and a header as shown:

[source,java]
----
template.sendBodyAndHeader("direct:start", null, "me", "Donald Duck");
----

The Rest producer needs to know the hostname and port of the REST service, which you can configure
using the host option as shown:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .to("rest:get:hello/{me}?host=myserver:8080/foo");
----

Instead of using the host option, you can configure the host on the `restConfiguration` as shown:

[source,java]
----
restConfiguration().host("myserver:8080/foo");

from("direct:start")
  .to("rest:get:hello/{me}");
----

You can use the `producerComponent` to select which Camel component to use as the HTTP client, for example
to use http you can do:

[source,java]
----
restConfiguration().host("myserver:8080/foo").producerComponent("http");

from("direct:start")
  .to("rest:get:hello/{me}");
----


== Rest producer binding

The REST producer supports binding using JSON or XML like the rest-dsl does.

For example to use jetty with JSON binding mode turned on you can configure this in the rest configuration:

[source,java]
----
restConfiguration().component("jetty").host("localhost").port(8080).bindingMode(RestBindingMode.json);

from("direct:start")
  .to("rest:post:user");
----

Then when calling the REST service using REST producer it will automatic bind any POJOs to JSON before calling the REST service:

[source,java]
----
  UserPojo user = new UserPojo();
  user.setId(123);
  user.setName("Donald Duck");

  template.sendBody("direct:start", user);
----

In the example above we send a POJO instance `UserPojo` as the message body. And because we have turned on JSON binding
in the rest configuration, then the POJO will be marshalled from POJO to JSON before calling the REST service.

However if you want to also perform binding for the response message (e.g. what the REST service sends back as response) you
would need to configure the `outType` option to specify what is the class name of the POJO to unmarshal from JSON to POJO.

For example if the REST service returns a JSON payload that binds to `com.foo.MyResponsePojo` you can configure this as shown:

[source,java]
----
  restConfiguration().component("jetty").host("localhost").port(8080).bindingMode(RestBindingMode.json);

  from("direct:start")
    .to("rest:post:user?outType=com.foo.MyResponsePojo");
----

IMPORTANT: You must configure `outType` option if you want POJO binding to happen for the response messages received from calling the REST service.


== More examples

See Rest DSL which offers more examples and how you
can use the Rest DSL to define those in a nicer RESTful way.

There is a *camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat* example in the Apache
Camel distribution, that demonstrates how to use the
Rest DSL with Servlet as
transport that can be deployed on Apache Tomcat, or similar web
containers.
