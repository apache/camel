/**
 * Access Google Cloud BigQuery service using SQL queries.
 *
 * BigQuery Endpoint Definition Represents a table within a BigQuery dataset Contains configuration details for a single
 * table and the utility methods (such as check, create) to ease operations URI Parameters: * Logger ID - To ensure that
 * logging is unified under Route Logger, the logger ID can be passed on via an endpoint URI parameter * Partitioned -
 * to indicate that the table needs to be partitioned - every UTC day to be written into a timestamped separate table
 * side effect: Australian operational day is always split between two UTC days, and, therefore, tables
 *
 * Another consideration is that exceptions are not handled within the class. They are expected to bubble up and be
 * handled by Camel.
