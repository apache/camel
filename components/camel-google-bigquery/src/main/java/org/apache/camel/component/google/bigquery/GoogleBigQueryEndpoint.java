/**
 * Google BigQuery data warehouse for analytics.
 * 
 * BigQuery Endpoint Definition
 * Represents a table within a BigQuery dataset
 * Contains configuration details for a single table and the utility methods (such as check, create) to ease operations
 * URI Parameters:
 * * Logger ID - To ensure that logging is unified under Route Logger, the logger ID can be passed on
 *               via an endpoint URI parameter
 * * Partitioned - to indicate that the table needs to be partitioned - every UTC day to be written into a
 *                 timestamped separate table
 *                 side effect: Australian operational day is always split between two UTC days, and, therefore, tables
 *
 * Another consideration is that exceptions are not handled within the class. They are expected to bubble up and be handled
 * by Camel.
