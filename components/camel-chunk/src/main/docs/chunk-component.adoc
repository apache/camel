*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Chunk component allows for processing a message using a
http://www.x5software.com/chunk/examples/ChunkExample?loc=en_US[Chunk] template.
This can be ideal when using Templating to
generate responses for requests.


== URI format

----------------------------
chunk:templateName[?options]
----------------------------

Where *templateName* is the classpath-local URI of the template to
invoke.

You can append query options to the URI in the following
format, `?option=value&option=value&...`


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The Chunk component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *allowContextMapAll* (producer) | Sets whether the context map should allow access to all details. By default only the message body and headers can be accessed. This option can be enabled for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext. Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API. | false | boolean
| *allowTemplateFromHeader* (producer) | Whether to allow to use resource template from header or not (default false). Enabling this allows to specify dynamic templates via message header. However this can be seen as a potential security vulnerability if the header is coming from a malicious user, so use this with care. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The Chunk endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
chunk:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* Path to the resource. You can prefix with: classpath, file, http, ref, or bean. classpath, file and http loads the resource using these protocols (classpath is default). ref will lookup the resource in the registry. bean will call a method on a bean to be used as the resource. For bean you can specify the method name after dot, eg bean:myBean.myMethod. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *allowContextMapAll* (producer) | Sets whether the context map should allow access to all details. By default only the message body and headers can be accessed. This option can be enabled for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext. Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API. | false | boolean
| *allowTemplateFromHeader* (producer) | Whether to allow to use resource template from header or not (default false). Enabling this allows to specify dynamic templates via message header. However this can be seen as a potential security vulnerability if the header is coming from a malicious user, so use this with care. | false | boolean
| *contentCache* (producer) | Sets whether to use resource content cache or not | false | boolean
| *encoding* (producer) | Define the encoding of the body |  | String
| *extension* (producer) | Define the file extension of the template |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *themeFolder* (producer) | Define the themes folder to scan |  | String
| *themeLayer* (producer) | Define the theme layer to elaborate |  | String
| *themeSubfolder* (producer) | Define the themes subfolder to scan |  | String
|===
// endpoint options: END


Chunk component will look for a specific template in _themes_ folder
with extensions _.chtml_ or _.cxml. _If you need to specify a different
folder or extensions, you will need to use the specific options listed
above.

== Chunk Context

Camel will provide exchange information in the Chunk context (just
a `Map`). The `Exchange` is transferred as:

 
[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|key |value

|`exchange` |The `Exchange` itself.

|`exchange.properties` |The `Exchange` properties.

|`headers` |The headers of the In message.

|`camelContext` |The Camel Context.

|`request` |The In message.

|`body` |The In message body.

|`response` |The Out message (only for InOut message exchange pattern).
|=======================================================================

== Dynamic templates

Camel provides two headers by which you can define a different resource
location for a template or the template content itself. If any of these
headers is set then Camel uses this over the endpoint configured
resource. This allows you to provide a dynamic template at runtime.

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,10%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description |Support Version

|ChunkConstants.CHUNK_RESOURCE_URI |String |A URI for the template resource to use instead of the endpoint
configured. |

|ChunkConstants.CHUNK_TEMPLATE |String |The template to use instead of the endpoint configured. |
|=======================================================================

== Samples

For example you could use something like:

[source,java]
--------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
to("chunk:template");
--------------------------

To use a Chunk template to formulate a response for a message for InOut
message exchanges (where there is a `JMSReplyTo` header).

If you want to use InOnly and consume the message and send it to another
destination you could use:

[source,java]
-----------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
to("chunk:template").
to("activemq:Another.Queue");
-----------------------------

It's possible to specify what template the component should use
dynamically via a header, so for example:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in").
setHeader(ChunkConstants.CHUNK_RESOURCE_URI).constant("template").
to("chunk:dummy?allowTemplateFromHeader=true");
------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of Chunk component options use:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in").
to("chunk:file_example?themeFolder=template&themeSubfolder=subfolder&extension=chunk");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example Chunk component will look for the file
_file_example.chunk_ in the folder _template/subfolder._

== The Email Sample

In this sample we want to use Chunk templating for an order confirmation
email. The email template is laid out in Chunk as:

[source,text]
----------------------------------------------
Dear {$headers.lastName}, {$headers.firstName}

Thanks for the order of {$headers.item}.

Regards Camel Riders Bookstore
{$body}
----------------------------------------------
