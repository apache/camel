*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 MQ component supports create, run, start, stop and terminate
https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/[AWS MQ] instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon MQ. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/[Amazon MQ].

[NOTE]
====
The AWS2 MQ component is not supported in OSGI
====

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws2-mq://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS 2 MQ component supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonMqClient* (producer) | *Autowired* To use a existing configured AmazonMQClient as client |  | MqClient
| *configuration* (producer) | Component configuration |  | MQ2Configuration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. It can be listBrokers,createBroker,deleteBroker. There are 6 enums and the value can be one of: listBrokers, createBroker, deleteBroker, rebootBroker, updateBroker, describeBroker |  | MQ2Operations
| *pojoRequest* (producer) | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not | false | boolean
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the MQ client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the MQ client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the MQ client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which MQ client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *trustAllCertificates* (producer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

Required MQ component options

You have to provide the amazonMqClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/[Amazon MQ] service.

== Usage

|=======================================================================

=== MQ Producer operations

Camel-AWS MQ component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listBrokers
- createBroker
- deleteBroker
- rebootBroker
- updateBroker
- describeBroker

== Producer Examples

- listBrokers: this operation will list the available MQ Brokers in AWS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listBrokers")
    .to("aws2-mq://test?amazonMqClient=#amazonMqClient&operation=listBrokers")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- createBroker: this operation will create an MQ Broker in AWS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:createBroker")
    .process(new Processor() {
       @Override
       public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_NAME, "test");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_DEPLOYMENT_MODE, DeploymentMode.SINGLE_INSTANCE);
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_INSTANCE_TYPE, "mq.t2.micro");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_ENGINE, EngineType.ACTIVEMQ.name());
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_ENGINE_VERSION, "5.15.6");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_PUBLICLY_ACCESSIBLE, false);
                List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
                User.Builder user = User.builder();
                user.username("camel");
                user.password("camelpwd");
                users.add(user.build());
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_USERS, users);
						
       }
    })
    .to("aws2-mq://test?amazonMqClient=#amazonMqClient&operation=createBroker")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- deleteBroker: this operation will delete an MQ Broker in AWS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listBrokers")
    .setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_ID, constant("123")
    .to("aws2-mq://test?amazonMqClient=#amazonMqClient&operation=deleteBroker")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- rebootBroker: this operation will delete an MQ Broker in AWS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listBrokers")
    .setHeader(MQ2Constants.BROKER_ID, constant("123")
    .to("aws2-mq://test?amazonMqClient=#amazonMqClient&operation=rebootBroker")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Automatic detection of MqClient client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an MqClient bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Using a POJO as body

Sometimes build an AWS Request can be complex, because of multiple options. We introduce the possibility to use a POJO as body.
In AWS MQ there are multiple operations you can submit, as an example for List brokers request, you can do something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:aws2-mq")
     .setBody(ListBrokersRequest.builder().maxResults(10).build())
     .to("aws2-mq://test?amazonMqClient=#amazonMqClient&operation=listBrokers&pojoRequest=true")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll pass the request directly without the need of passing headers and options specifically related to this operation.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-mq</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
