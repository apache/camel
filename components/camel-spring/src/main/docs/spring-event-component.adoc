## Spring Event Component

The *spring-event:* component provides access to the Spring
`ApplicationEvent` objects. This allows you to publish
`ApplicationEvent` objects to a Spring `ApplicationContext` or to
consume them. You can then use
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] to process them such as link:message-filter.html[Message
Filter].
