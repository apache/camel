The Ignite Compute endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to run https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/compute-grid[compute operations] on the cluster by passing in an IgniteCallable, an IgniteRunnable, an IgniteClosure, or collections of them, along with their parameters if necessary.

The host part of the endpoint URI is a symbolic endpoint ID, it is not used for any purposes.

The endpoint tries to run the object passed in the body of the IN message as the compute job. It expects different payload types depending on the execution type.
