== Ignite Compute Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.17*

The Ignite Compute endpoint is one of link:ignite.html[camel-ignite endpoints] which allows you to run https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/compute-grid[compute operations] on the cluster by passing in an IgniteCallable, an IgniteRunnable, an IgniteClosure, or collections of them, along with their parameters if necessary.

This endpoint only supports producers.

The host part of the endpoint URI is a symbolic endpoint ID, it is not used for any purposes.

The endpoint tries to run the object passed in the body of the IN message as the compute job. It expects different payload types depending on the execution type.

### Options

// component options: START
The Ignite Compute component supports 4 options which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *ignite* (producer) | Sets the Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *configurationResource* (producer) | Sets the resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URI String (URI) or an InputStream. |  | Object
| *igniteConfiguration* (producer) | Allows the user to set a programmatic IgniteConfiguration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *resolveProperty Placeholders* (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Ignite Compute endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
ignite-compute:endpointId
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *endpointId* | *Required* The endpoint ID (not used). |  | String
|===

==== Query Parameters (8 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *clusterGroupExpression* (producer) | An expression that returns the Cluster Group for the IgniteCompute instance. |  | ClusterGroupExpression
| *computeName* (producer) | The name of the compute job which will be set via link IgniteComputewithName(String). |  | String
| *executionType* (producer) | *Required* The compute operation to perform. Possible values: CALL BROADCAST APPLY EXECUTE RUN AFFINITY_CALL AFFINITY_RUN. The component expects different payload types depending on the operation. |  | IgniteComputeExecution Type
| *propagateIncomingBodyIfNo ReturnValue* (producer) | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | boolean
| *taskName* (producer) | The task name only applicable if using the link IgniteComputeExecutionTypeEXECUTE execution type. |  | String
| *timeoutMillis* (producer) | The timeout interval for triggered jobs in milliseconds which will be set via link IgniteComputewithTimeout(long). |  | Long
| *treatCollectionsAsCache Objects* (producer) | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute etc. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

#### Expected payload types

Each operation expects the indicated types:
[width="100%",cols="1,4",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Operation | Expected payloads
| CALL | Collection of IgniteCallable, or a single IgniteCallable.
| BROADCAST | IgniteCallable, IgniteRunnable, IgniteClosure.
| APPLY | IgniteClosure.
| EXECUTE | ComputeTask, Class<? extends ComputeTask> or an object representing parameters if the taskName option is not null.
| RUN | A Collection of IgniteRunnables, or a single IgniteRunnable.
| AFFINITY_CALL | IgniteCallable.
| AFFINITY_RUN | IgniteRunnable.
|=======================================================================

#### Headers used

This endpoint uses the following headers:

 Allows you to dynamically change the compute operation to perform.

| CamelIgniteComputeParameters | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_COMPUTE_PARAMS | Any object or Collection of objects. |
Parameters for APPLY, BROADCAST and EXECUTE operations.

| CamelIgniteComputeReducer | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_COMPUTE_REDUCER | IgniteReducer |
Reducer for the APPLY and CALL operations.

| CamelIgniteComputeAffinityCacheName | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_COMPUTE_AFFINITY_CACHE_NAME | String |
Affinity cache name for the AFFINITY_CALL and AFFINITY_RUN operations.

| CamelIgniteComputeAffinityKey | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_COMPUTE_AFFINITY_KEY | Object |
Affinity key for the AFFINITY_CALL and AFFINITY_RUN operations.
