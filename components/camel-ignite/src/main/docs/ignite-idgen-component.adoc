= Ignite ID Generator Component

*Since Camel 2.17*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Ignite ID Generator endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to interact with https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/id-generator[Ignite Atomic Sequences and ID Generators].

This endpoint only supports producers.

== Options

// component options: START
The Ignite ID Generator component supports 6 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *ignite* (producer) | Sets the Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *configurationResource* (producer) | Sets the resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URI, String (URI) or an InputStream. |  | Object
| *igniteConfiguration* (producer) | Allows the user to set a programmatic IgniteConfiguration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *batchSize* (producer) | The batch size. |  | Integer
| *initialValue* (producer) | The initial value. | 0 | Long
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to invoke on the Ignite ID Generator. Superseded by the IgniteConstants.IGNITE_IDGEN_OPERATION header in the IN message. Possible values: ADD_AND_GET, GET, GET_AND_ADD, GET_AND_INCREMENT, INCREMENT_AND_GET. |  | IgniteIdGenOperation
| *propagateIncomingBodyIfNo ReturnValue* (producer) | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | boolean
| *treatCollectionsAsCache Objects* (producer) | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute, etc. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===

// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-ignite-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

The component supports 7 options, which are listed below.
