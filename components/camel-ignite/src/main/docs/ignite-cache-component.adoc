The Ignite Cache endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to interact with an https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/data-grid[Ignite Cache].
This offers both a Producer (to invoke cache operations on an Ignite cache) and a Consumer (to consume changes from a continuous query).

The cache value is always the body of the message, whereas the cache key is always stored in the `IgniteConstants.IGNITE_CACHE_KEY` message header.

Even if you configure a fixed operation in the endpoint URI, you can vary it per-exchange by setting the `IgniteConstants.IGNITE_CACHE_OPERATION` message header.
