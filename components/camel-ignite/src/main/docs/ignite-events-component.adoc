*{component-header}*

The Ignite Events endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/events[receive events] from the Ignite cluster by creating a local event listener.

This endpoint only supports consumers.
The Exchanges created by this consumer put the received Event object into the body of the IN message.

== Options

// component options: START
The Ignite Events component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *configurationResource* (consumer) | Resource from where to load configuration. |  | Object
| *ignite* (consumer) | Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *igniteConfiguration* (consumer) | Ignite configuration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
