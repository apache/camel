The Splunk HEC component allows to send data to Splunk using the
https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/dataapps/httpeventcollector/[HTTP Event Collector].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------
 <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-splunk-hec</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------
  splunk-hec:[endpoint]/[token]?[options]
-------------------------------


// component options: START
The Splunk HEC component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Splunk HEC endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
splunk-hec:endpoint/token
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *endpointUri* | Splunk host URI |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (12 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *index* (producer) | Splunk index to write to |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *source* (producer) | Splunk source argument |  | String
| *sourceType* (producer) | Splunk sourcetype argument |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *host* (host) | Splunk host. |  | String
| *https* (https) | Contact HEC over https. | false | boolean
| *skiptlsverify* (skiptlsverify) | Splunk HEC TLS verification. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: END

== Message body
The body must be serializable to JSON so it may be sent to Splunk.

A `String` or a `java.util.Map` object can be serialized easily.

== Use Cases
The Splunk HEC endpoint may be used to stream data to Splunk for ingestion.

It is meant for high volume ingestion of machine data.
