## Hipchat Component

*Available as of Camel 2.15.0*

The Hipchat component supports producing and consuming messages from/to
https://www.hipchat.com[Hipchat] service.

*Prerequisites*

You must have a valid Hipchat user account and get a
https://www.hipchat.com/account/api[personal access token] that you can
use to produce/consume messages.


### URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------------
hipchat://[host][:port]?options
-------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

### URI Options


// component options: START
The Hipchat component has no options.
// component options: END






// endpoint options: START
The Hipchat component supports 24 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| protocol | common |  | String | *Required* The protocol for the hipchat server such as http.
| host | common |  | String | *Required* The host for the hipchat server such as api.hipchat.com
| port | common | 80 | Integer | The port for the hipchat server. Is by default 80.
| authToken | common |  | String | OAuth 2 auth token
| consumeUsers | common |  | String | Username(s) when consuming messages from the hiptchat server. Multiple user names can be separated by comma.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle | consumer | false | boolean | If the polling consumer did not poll any files you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead.
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.
| pollStrategy | consumer (advanced) |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
| backoffErrorThreshold | scheduler |  | int | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
| backoffIdleThreshold | scheduler |  | int | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in.
| backoffMultiplier | scheduler |  | int | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured.
| delay | scheduler | 500 | long | Milliseconds before the next poll. You can also specify time values using units such as 60s (60 seconds) 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds) and 1h (1 hour).
| greedy | scheduler | false | boolean | If greedy is enabled then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again if the previous run polled 1 or more messages.
| initialDelay | scheduler | 1000 | long | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. You can also specify time values using units such as 60s (60 seconds) 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds) and 1h (1 hour).
| runLoggingLevel | scheduler | TRACE | LoggingLevel | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that.
| scheduledExecutorService | scheduler |  | ScheduledExecutorService | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool.
| scheduler | scheduler | none | ScheduledPollConsumerScheduler | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz2 component
| schedulerProperties | scheduler |  | Map | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz2 Spring based scheduler.
| startScheduler | scheduler | true | boolean | Whether the scheduler should be auto started.
| timeUnit | scheduler | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options.
| useFixedDelay | scheduler | true | boolean | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details.

### Scheduled Poll Consumer

This component implements the
link:polling-consumer.html[ScheduledPollConsumer]. Only the last message
from the provided 'consumeUsers' are retrieved and sent as Exchange
body. If you do not want the same message to be retrieved again when
there are no new messages on next poll then you can add the
link:idempotent-consumer.html[idempotent consumer] as shown below. All
the options on the link:polling-consumer.html[ScheduledPollConsumer] can
also be used for more control on the consumer.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Override
public void configure() throws Exception {
 String hipchatEndpointUri = "hipchat://?authToken=XXXX&consumeUsers=@Joe,@John";
 from(hipchatEndpointUri)
  .idempotentConsumer(
    simple("${in.header.HipchatMessageDate} ${in.header.HipchatFromUser}"),
    MemoryIdempotentRepository.memoryIdempotentRepository(200)
  )
  .to("mock:result");
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Producer can send messages to both Room's and User's simultaneously. The
body of the exchange is sent as message. Sample usage is shown below.
Appropriate headers needs to be set.

@Override
 public void configure() throws Exception {
  String hipchatEndpointUri = "hipchat://?authToken=XXXX";
  from("direct:start")
   .to(hipchatEndpointUri)
