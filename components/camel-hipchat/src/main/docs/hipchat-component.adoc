= Hipchat Component

*Since Camel 2.15*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Hipchat component supports producing and consuming messages from/to
https://www.hipchat.com[Hipchat] service.

*Prerequisites*

You must have a valid Hipchat user account and get a
https://www.hipchat.com/account/api[personal access token] that you can
use to produce/consume messages.


== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------------
hipchat://[host][:port]?options
-------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The Hipchat component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END






// endpoint options: START
The Hipchat endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
hipchat:protocol:host:port
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *protocol* | *Required* The protocol for the hipchat server, such as http. |  | String
| *host* | *Required* The host for the hipchat server, such as api.hipchat.com |  | String
| *port* | The port for the hipchat server. Is by default 80. | 80 | Integer
|===


=== Query Parameters (25 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *authToken* (common) | OAuth 2 auth token |  | String
| *consumeUsers* (common) | Username(s) when consuming messages from the hiptchat server. Multiple user names can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *httpClient* (common) | The CloseableHttpClient reference from registry to be used during API HTTP requests. | CloseableHttpClient default from HttpClient library | CloseableHttpClient
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 5000 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long

| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutorService
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. The value can be one of: none, spring, quartz | none | String
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map
| *startScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | boolean
| *timeUnit* (scheduler) | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. The value can be one of: NANOSECONDS, MICROSECONDS, MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit
| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean

== Scheduled Poll Consumer

This component implements the
ScheduledPollConsumer. Only the last message
from the provided 'consumeUsers' are retrieved and sent as Exchange
body. If you do not want the same message to be retrieved again when
there are no new messages on next poll then you can add the
idempotent consumer as shown below. All
the options on the ScheduledPollConsumer can
also be used for more control on the consumer.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Override
public void configure() throws Exception {
 String hipchatEndpointUri = "hipchat://?authToken=XXXX&consumeUsers=@Joe,@John";
 from(hipchatEndpointUri)
  .idempotentConsumer(
    simple("${in.header.HipchatMessageDate} ${in.header.HipchatFromUser}"),
    MemoryIdempotentRepository.memoryIdempotentRepository(200)
  )
  .to("mock:result");
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Configuring Http Client

The HipChat component allow your own `HttpClient` configuration. This can be done by defining a reference for `CloseableHttpClient` in the http://camel.apache.org/registry.html[registry] (e.g. Spring Context) and then, set the parameter during the Endpoint definition, for example: `hipchat:http://api.hipchat.com?httpClient=#myHttpClient`.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------
CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.custom()
    .setConnectionManager(connManager)
    .setDefaultCookieStore(cookieStore)
    .setDefaultCredentialsProvider(credentialsProvider)
    .setProxy(new HttpHost("myproxy", 8080))
    .setDefaultRequestConfig(defaultRequestConfig)
    .build();
------------------------------------------

To see more information about Http Client configuration, please check the https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/examples.html[official documentation].
 

=== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-hipchat</artifactId>
