*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-platform-http-vertx is a Vert.x based implementation of the `PlatformHttp` SPI.

== Vert.x Route

This implementation will by default lookup an instance of `VertxPlatformHttpRouter` on the registry however you can
configure an existing instance using the getter/setter on the `VertxPlatformHttpEngine` class.

== Auto detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-platform-http-vertx` dependency to the classpath,
and the platform http component should auto-detect this.

== Message Headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,20%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description

|`CamelVertxPlatformHttpAuthenticatedUser` |`io.vertx.ext.auth.User` |If an authenticated user is present on the Vert.x Web `RoutingContext`, this header is populated with a `User` object containing the `Principal`.
|`CamelVertxPlatformHttpLocalAddress` |`io.vertx.core.net.SocketAddress` |The local address for the connection if present on the Vert.x Web `RoutingContext`.
|`CamelVertxPlatformHttpRemoteAddress` |`io.vertx.core.net.SocketAddress` |The remote address for the connection if present on the Vert.x Web `RoutingContext`.
|=======================================================================

Camel also populates *all* request.parameter and Camel also populates *all* request.parameter and request.headers. For
example, given a client request with the URL,
`\http://myserver/myserver?orderid=123`, the exchange will contain a
header named `orderid` with the value 123.
request.headers. For example, given a client request with the URL, `\http://myserver/myserver?orderid=123`, the exchange will contain a header named `orderid` with the value 123.

== VertxPlatformHttpServer

In addition to the implementation of the `PlatformHttp` SPI based on Vert.x, this module provides a Vert.x based HTTP
server compatible with the `VertxPlatformHttpEngine`:

[source,java]
----
final int port = AvailablePortFinder.getNextAvailable();
final CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();

VertxPlatformHttpServerConfiguration conf = new VertxPlatformHttpServerConfiguration();
conf.setBindPort(port);

context.addService(new VertxPlatformHttpServer(conf));
context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("platform-http:/test")
            .routeId("get")
            .setBody().constant("Hello from Camel's PlatformHttp service");
    }
});

context.start();
----

== Implementing a reverse proxy

Platform HTTP component can act as a reverse proxy, in that case `Exchange.HTTP_URI`, `Exchange.HTTP_HOST` headers are populated from the absolute URL received on the request line of the HTTP request.

Here's an example of a HTTP proxy that simply redirects the Exchange to the origin server.

[source,java]
----
from("platform-http:proxy")
    .toD("http://"
        + "${headers." + Exchange.HTTP_HOST + "}");
----

== Access to Request and Response

The Vertx HTTP server has its own API abstraction for HTTP request/response objects which you can access via
Camel `HttpMessage` as shown in the custom `Processor` below :

[source,java]
----
.process(exchange -> {
    // grab message as HttpMessage
    HttpMessage message = exchange.getMessage(HttpMessage.class);
    // use getRequest() / getResponse() to access Vertx directly
    // you can add custom headers
    message.getResponse().putHeader("beer", "Heineken");
    // also access request details and use that in the code
    String p = message.getRequest().path();
    message.setBody("request path: " + p);
});
----

== Handling large request / response payloads

When large request / response payloads are expected, there is a `useStreaming` option, which can be enabled to improve performance.
When `useStreaming` is `true`, it will take advantage of xref:manual::stream-caching.adoc[stream caching]. In conjunction with enabling disk spooling, you can avoid having to store the entire request body payload in memory.

[source,java]
----
// Handle a large request body and stream it to a file
from("platform-http:/upload?httpMethodRestrict=POST&useStreaming=true")
    .log("Processing large request body...")
    .to("file:/uploads?fileName=uploaded.txt")
