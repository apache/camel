The camel-micrometer-prometheus is used for running Camel standalone (camel-main) and integrate with Micrometer Prometheus Registry.

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-micrometer-prometheus` dependency to the classpath,
and turn on metrics in `application.properties` such as:

[source,properties]
----
# enable HTTP server with metrics
camel.server.enabled=true
camel.server.metricsEnabled=true

# turn on micrometer metrics
camel.metrics.enabled=true
# include more camel details
camel.metrics.enableMessageHistory=true
# include additional out-of-the-box micrometer metrics for cpu, jvm and used file descriptors
camel.metrics.binders=processor,jvm-info,file-descriptor
----
