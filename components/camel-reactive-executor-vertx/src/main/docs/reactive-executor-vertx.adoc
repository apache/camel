*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-reactive-executor-vertx is a VertX based implementation of the `ReactiveExecutor` SPI.

By default Camel uses its own reactive engine for routing messages, but you can plugin
different engines via a SPI interface. This is a VertX based plugin that uses the VertX event loop
for processing message during routing.

[NOTE]

At this time this component is an experiment so use it with care.

== VertX instance

This implementation will first lookup in the registry for an existing `io.vertx.core.Vertx` to be used.
However you can configure an existing instance using the getter/setter on the `VertXReactiveExecutor` class.

== Auto detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-reactive-executor-vertx` dependency to the classpath,
and Camel should auto-detect this on startup and log as follows:
