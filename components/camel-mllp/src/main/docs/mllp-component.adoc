*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The MLLP component is specifically designed to handle the nuances of the
MLLP protocol and provide the functionality required by Healthcare
providers to communicate with other systems using the MLLP protocol.

The MLLP component provides a simple configuration URI, automated HL7
acknowledgment generation, and automatic acknowledgment interrogation.

The MLLP protocol does not typically use a large number of concurrent
TCP connections - a single active TCP connection is the normal case.
Therefore, the MLLP component uses a simple thread-per-connection model
based on standard Java Sockets. This keeps the implementation simple
and eliminates the dependencies on only Camel itself.

The component supports the following:

* A Camel consumer using a TCP Server
* A Camel producer using a TCP Client

The MLLP component use `byte[]` payloads, and relies on Camel type
conversion to convert `byte[]` to other types.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-mllp</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== MLLP Consumer

The MLLP Consumer supports receiving MLLP-framed messages and sending
HL7 Acknowledgements.  The MLLP Consumer can automatically generate the
HL7 Acknowledgement (HL7 Application Acknowledgements only - AA, AE and
AR), or the acknowledgement can be specified using
the `CamelMllpAcknowledgement` exchange property.  Additionally, the type
of acknowledgement that will be generated can be controlled by setting
the `CamelMllpAcknowledgementType` exchange property. The MLLP Consumer
can read messages without sending any HL7 Acknowledgement if the
automatic acknowledgement is disabled and the exchange pattern is `InOnly`.

=== Exchange Properties

The type of acknowledgment the MLLP Consumer generates and state of the TCP Socket can be controlled
by these properties on the Camel exchange:

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",]
|====================================
|*Key* |*Type* |*Description*
|`CamelMllpAcknowledgement` | byte[] | If present, this property will be sent to the client as the MLLP Acknowledgement
|`CamelMllpAcknowledgementString` | String | If present and `CamelMllpAcknowledgement` is not present, this property will we sent to the client as the MLLP Acknowledgement
|`CamelMllpAcknowledgementMsaText` | String | If neither `CamelMllpAcknowledgement` or `CamelMllpAcknowledgementString` are present and autoAck is true, this property can be used to specify the contents of MSA-3 in the generated HL7 acknowledgement
|`CamelMllpAcknowledgementType` | String  | If neither `CamelMllpAcknowledgement` or `CamelMllpAcknowledgementString` are present and autoAck is true, this property can be used to specify the HL7 acknowledgement type (i.e. AA, AE, AR)
|`CamelMllpAutoAcknowledge` | Boolean | Overrides the autoAck query parameter

|`CamelMllpCloseConnectionBeforeSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed before sending data
|`CamelMllpResetConnectionBeforeSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset before sending data
|`CamelMllpCloseConnectionAfterSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed immediately after sending data
|`CamelMllpResetConnectionAfterSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset immediately after sending any data
|====================================

== MLLP Producer

The MLLP Producer supports sending MLLP-framed messages and receiving
HL7 Acknowledgements.  The MLLP Producer interrogates the HL7
Acknowledgements and raises exceptions if a negative acknowledgement is
received.  The received acknowledgement is interrogated and an exception
is raised in the event of a negative acknowledgement. The MLLP Producer
can ignore acknowledgements when configured with InOnly exchange pattern.

=== Exchange Properties

The state of the TCP Socket can be controlled by these properties on the Camel exchange:

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",]
|====================================
|*Key* |*Type* |*Description*
|`CamelMllpCloseConnectionBeforeSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed before sending data
|`CamelMllpResetConnectionBeforeSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset before sending data
|`CamelMllpCloseConnectionAfterSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed immediately after sending data
|`CamelMllpResetConnectionAfterSend` | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset immediately after sending any data
