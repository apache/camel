    CacheManager Configuration
    ==========================
    An ehcache.xml corresponds to a single CacheManager.
    
    See instructions below or the ehcache schema (ehcache.xsd) on how to configure.

    System property tokens can be specified in this file which are replaced when the configuration
    is loaded. For example multicastGroupPort=${multicastGroupPort} can be replaced with the
    System property either from an environment variable or a system property specified with a
    command line switch such as -DmulticastGroupPort=4446.

    DiskStore configuration
    =======================

    The diskStore element is optional. To turn off disk store path creation, comment out the diskStore
    element below.

    Configure it if you have overflowToDisk or diskPersistent enabled for any cache.

    If it is not configured, and a cache is created which requires a disk store, a warning will be
     issued and java.io.tmpdir will automatically be used.

    diskStore has only one attribute - "path". It is the path to the directory where
    .data and .index files will be created.

    If the path is one of the following Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the
    running VM. For backward compatibility these are not specified without being enclosed in the ${token}
    replacement syntax.

    The following properties are translated:
    * user.home - User's home directory
    * user.dir - User's current working directory
    * java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path
    * ehcache.disk.store.dir - A system property you would normally specify on the command line
      e.g. java -Dehcache.disk.store.dir=/u01/myapp/diskdir ...

    Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one

    -->
    <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/>

    <!--
    CacheManagerEventListener
    =========================
    Specifies a CacheManagerEventListenerFactory which is notified when Caches are added
    or removed from the CacheManager.

    The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
    * class - a fully qualified factory class name
    * properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.

    The events include:
    * adding a Cache
    * removing a Cache

    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility
    of the implementer to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues
    depending on what their listener is doing.

    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.
    -->
    <cacheManagerEventListenerFactory class="" properties=""/>


    <!--
    CacheManagerPeerProvider
    ========================
    (For distributed operation)

    Specifies a CacheManagerPeerProviderFactory which will be used to create a
    CacheManagerPeerProvider, which discovers other CacheManagers in the cluster.

    One or more providers can be configured. The first one in the ehcache.xml is the default, which is used
    for replication and bootstrapping.

    The attributes of cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory are:
    * class - a fully qualified factory class name
    * properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Providers are available for RMI, JGroups and JMS as shown following.

    RMICacheManagerPeerProvider
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system with two means of discovery of
    CacheManager peers participating in the cluster:
    * automatic, using a multicast group. This one automatically discovers peers and detects
      changes such as peers entering and leaving the group
    * manual, using manual rmiURL configuration. A hardcoded list of peers is provided at
      configuration time.

    Configuring Automatic Discovery:
    Automatic discovery is configured as per the following example:
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
                        class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                        properties="peerDiscovery=automatic, multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1,
                                    multicastGroupPort=4446, timeToLive=32"/>

    Valid properties are:
    * peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "automatic"
    * multicastGroupAddress (mandatory) - specify a valid multicast group address
    * multicastGroupPort (mandatory) - specify a dedicated port for the multicast heartbeat
      traffic
    * timeToLive - specify a value between 0 and 255 which determines how far the packets will
      propagate.

      By convention, the restrictions are:
      0   - the same host
      1   - the same subnet
      32  - the same site
      64  - the same region
      128 - the same continent
      255 - unrestricted

    Configuring Manual Discovery:
    Manual discovery is configured as per the following example:
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class=
                          "net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                          properties="peerDiscovery=manual,
                          rmiUrls=//server1:40000/sampleCache1|//server2:40000/sampleCache1
                          | //server1:40000/sampleCache2|//server2:40000/sampleCache2"
                          propertySeparator="," />

    Valid properties are:
    * peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "manual"
    * rmiUrls (mandatory) - specify a pipe separated list of rmiUrls, in the form
                            //hostname:port

    The hostname is the hostname of the remote CacheManager peer. The port is the listening
    port of the RMICacheManagerPeerListener of the remote CacheManager peer.
    
    JGroupsCacheManagerPeerProvider
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jgroups.JGroupsCacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                                     properties="connect=UDP(mcast_addr=231.12.21.132;mcast_port=45566;ip_ttl=32;
                                     mcast_send_buf_size=150000;mcast_recv_buf_size=80000):
                                     PING(timeout=2000;num_initial_members=6):
                                     MERGE2(min_interval=5000;max_interval=10000):
                                     FD_SOCK:VERIFY_SUSPECT(timeout=1500):

                                     UNICAST(timeout=5000):
                                     pbcast.STABLE(desired_avg_gossip=20000):
                                     FRAG:
                                     pbcast.GMS(join_timeout=5000;join_retry_timeout=2000;shun=false;print_local_addr=false)"
                                     propertySeparator="::"
            />
     The only property necessary is the connect String used by jgroups to configure itself. Refer to the Jgroups documentation for explanation
     of all the protocols. The example above uses UDP multicast. If the connect property is not specified the default JGroups connection will be
     used.       


    JMSCacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
            class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jms.JMSCacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
            properties="..."
            propertySeparator=","
            />

    The JMS PeerProviderFactory uses JNDI to maintain message queue independence. Refer to the manual for full configuration
    examples using ActiveMQ and Open Message Queue.

    Valid properties are:
    * initialContextFactoryName (mandatory) - the name of the factory used to create the message queue initial context.
    * providerURL (mandatory) - the JNDI configuration information for the service provider to use.
    * replicationTopicConnectionFactoryBindingName (mandatory) - the JNDI binding name for the TopicConnectionFactory
    * replicationTopicBindingName (mandatory) - the JNDI binding name for the topic name
    * getQueueConnectionFactoryBindingName (mandatory only if using jmsCacheLoader) - the JNDI binding name for the getQueueConnectionFactory
    * getQueueBindingName (mandatory only if using jmsCacheLoader) - the JNDI binding name for the queue name
    * securityPrincipalName - the JNDI java.naming.security.principal
    * securityCredentials - the JNDI java.naming.security.credentials
    * urlPkgPrefixes - the JNDI java.naming.factory.url.pkgs
    * userName - the user name to use when creating the TopicConnection to the Message Queue
    * password - the password to use when creating the TopicConnection to the Message Queue
    * acknowledgementMode - the JMS Acknowledgement mode for both publisher and subscriber. The available choices are
                            AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE, DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE and SESSION_TRANSACTED. The default is AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE.

    <!--
    CacheManagerPeerListener
    ========================
    (Enable for distributed operation)

    Specifies a CacheManagerPeerListenerFactory which will be used to create a
    CacheManagerPeerListener, which
    listens for messages from cache replicators participating in the cluster.

    The attributes of cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory are:
    class - a fully qualified factory class name
    properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system. The listener component is
    RMICacheManagerPeerListener which is configured using
    RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory. It is configured as per the following example:

    <cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory
        class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"
        properties="hostName=fully_qualified_hostname_or_ip,
                    port=40001,
                    remoteObjectPort=40002,
                    socketTimeoutMillis=120000"
                    propertySeparator="," />

    All properties are optional. They are:
    * hostName - the hostName of the host the listener is running on. Specify
      where the host is multihomed and you want to control the interface over which cluster
      messages are received. Defaults to the host name of the default interface if not
      specified.
    * port - the port the RMI Registry listener listens on. This defaults to a free port if not specified.
    * remoteObjectPort - the port number on which the remote objects bound in the registry receive calls.
                         This defaults to a free port if not specified.
    * socketTimeoutMillis - the number of ms client sockets will stay open when sending
      messages to the listener. This should be long enough for the slowest message.
      If not specified it defaults to 120000ms.

            class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"/>


    <!--
    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

	maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
	The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    clearOnFlush:
    whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.
    By default, this is true i.e. the MemoryStore is cleared.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

    Cache elements can also contain sub elements which take the same format of a factory class
    and properties. Defined sub-elements are:

    * cacheEventListenerFactory - Enables registration of listeners for cache events, such as
      put, remove, update, and expire.

    * bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a BootstrapCacheLoader, which is called by a
      cache on initialisation to prepopulate itself.

    * cacheExtensionFactory - Specifies a CacheExtension, a generic mechansim to tie a class
      which holds a reference to a cache to the cache lifecycle.

    * cacheExceptionHandlerFactory - Specifies a CacheExceptionHandler, which is called when
      cache exceptions occur.

    * cacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a CacheLoader, which can be used both asynchronously and
      synchronously to load objects into a cache. More than one cacheLoaderFactory element
      can be added, in which case the loaders form a chain which are executed in order. If a
      loader returns null, the next in chain is called.

    RMI Cache Replication
    +++++++++++++++++++++

    Each cache that will be distributed needs to set a cache event listener which replicates
    messages to the other CacheManager peers. For the built-in RMI implementation this is done
    by adding a cacheEventListenerFactory element of type RMICacheReplicatorFactory to each
    distributed cache's configuration as per the following example:

    <cacheEventListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheReplicatorFactory"
         properties="replicateAsynchronously=true,
         replicatePuts=true,
         replicatePutsViaCopy=false,
         replicateUpdates=true,
         replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true,
         replicateRemovals=true
         asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=<number of milliseconds"
         propertySeparator="," />

    The RMICacheReplicatorFactory recognises the following properties:

    * replicatePuts=true|false - whether new elements placed in a cache are
      replicated to others. Defaults to true.

    * replicatePutsViaCopy=true|false - whether the new elements are
      copied to other caches (true), or whether a remove message is sent. Defaults to true.  

    * replicateUpdates=true|false - whether new elements which override an
      element already existing with the same key are replicated. Defaults to true.

    * replicateRemovals=true - whether element removals are replicated. Defaults to true.

    * replicateAsynchronously=true | false - whether replications are
      asynchronous (true) or synchronous (false). Defaults to true.

    * replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true | false - whether the new elements are
      copied to other caches (true), or whether a remove message is sent. Defaults to true.

    * asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=<number of milliseconds> - The asynchronous
      replicator runs at a set interval of milliseconds. The default is 1000. The minimum
      is 10. This property is only applicable if replicateAsynchronously=true


    JGroups Replication
    +++++++++++++++++++

	For the Jgroups replication this is done with:
	<cacheEventListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jgroups.JGroupsCacheReplicatorFactory"
                            properties="replicateAsynchronously=true, replicatePuts=true,
 							replicateUpdates=true, replicateUpdatesViaCopy=false,
 							replicateRemovals=true,asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=1000"/>
    This listener supports the same properties as the RMICacheReplicationFactory.


    JMS Replication
    +++++++++++++++

	For JMS-based replication this is done with:
	<cacheEventListenerFactory
          class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jms.JMSCacheReplicatorFactory"
          properties="replicateAsynchronously=true,
                       replicatePuts=true,
                       replicateUpdates=true,
                       replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true,
                       replicateRemovals=true,
                       asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=1000"
           propertySeparator=","/>

    This listener supports the same properties as the RMICacheReplicationFactory.
    
    Cluster Bootstrapping
    +++++++++++++++++++++

    Bootstrapping a cluster may use a different mechanism to replication. e.g you can mix
    JMS replication with bootstrap via RMI - just make sure you have the cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
    and cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory configured.

    There are two bootstrapping mechanisms: RMI and JGroups.

    RMI Bootstrap

    The RMIBootstrapCacheLoader bootstraps caches in clusters where RMICacheReplicators are
    used. It is configured as per the following example:

    <bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory
        class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory"
        properties="bootstrapAsynchronously=true, maximumChunkSizeBytes=5000000"
        propertySeparator="," />

    The RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory recognises the following optional properties:

    * bootstrapAsynchronously=true|false - whether the bootstrap happens in the background
      after the cache has started. If false, bootstrapping must complete before the cache is
      made available. The default value is true.

    * maximumChunkSizeBytes=<integer> - Caches can potentially be very large, larger than the
      memory limits of the VM. This property allows the bootstraper to fetched elements in
      chunks. The default chunk size is 5000000 (5MB).

    JGroups Bootstrap

    Here is an example of bootstrap configuration using JGroups boostrap:

    <bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jgroups.JGroupsBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory"
                                    properties="bootstrapAsynchronously=true"/>

    The configuration properties are the same as for RMI above. Note that JGroups bootstrap only supports
    asynchronous bootstrap mode.                                


    Cache Exception Handling

    By default, most cache operations will propagate a runtime CacheException on failure. An
    interceptor, using a dynamic proxy, may be configured so that a CacheExceptionHandler can
    be configured to intercept Exceptions. Errors are not intercepted.

    It is configured as per the following example:

      <cacheExceptionHandlerFactory class="com.example.ExampleExceptionHandlerFactory"
                                      properties="logLevel=FINE"/>

    Caches with ExceptionHandling configured are not of type Cache, but are of type Ehcache only,
    and are not available using CacheManager.getCache(), but using CacheManager.getEhcache().


    Cache Loader

    A default CacheLoader may be set which loads objects into the cache through asynchronous and
    synchronous methods on Cache. This is different to the bootstrap cache loader, which is used
    only in distributed caching.

    It is configured as per the following example:

        <cacheLoaderFactory class="com.example.ExampleCacheLoaderFactory"
                                      properties="type=int,startCounter=10"/>

    Cache Extension

    CacheExtensions are a general purpose mechanism to allow generic extensions to a Cache.
    CacheExtensions are tied into the Cache lifecycle.

    CacheExtensions are created using the CacheExtensionFactory which has a
    <code>createCacheCacheExtension()</code> method which takes as a parameter a
    Cache and properties. It can thus call back into any public method on Cache, including, of
    course, the load methods.

    Extensions are added as per the following example:

         <cacheExtensionFactory class="com.example.FileWatchingCacheRefresherExtensionFactory"
                             properties="refreshIntervalMillis=18000, loaderTimeout=3000,
                                         flushPeriod=whatever, someOtherProperty=someValue ..."/>

    <defaultCache
            maxElementsInMemory="10000"
            eternal="false"

            memoryStoreEvictionPolicy="LRU"
            />

</ehcache>
