Apache Camel has extensive support for JMX to allow you to monitor and
control the Camel managed objects with a JMX client.

Camel also provides a xref:jmx-component.adoc[JMX] component that allows you to
subscribe to MBean notifications. This page is about how to manage and
monitor Camel using JMX.

[NOTE]
====
If you run Camel standalone with just `camel-core` as a dependency, and you want JMX to enable out of the box, then you need to add `camel-management` as a dependency.
