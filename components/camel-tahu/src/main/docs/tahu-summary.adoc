:description: Sparkplug B Edge Node and Host Application support over MQTT using Eclipse Tahu
:since: 4.8
:supportlevel: Preview
:tabs-sync-option:
:component-header: Both producer and consumer are supported

*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Tahu components adapt the 
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.tahu[Eclipse Tahu] library for Camel.
These components support creating Sparkplug Edge Nodes, Devices, and Host
Applications as described by https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.sparkplug[Eclipse Sparkplug]
using Sparkplug B payload encoding.

For more information regarding Sparkplug concepts and required behavior, consult the
https://www.eclipse.org/tahu/spec/sparkplug_spec.pdf[Sparkplug 3.0.0 Specification]

NOTE: Neither the use of the Eclipse Tahu library nor the Camel Tahu Components
implies Sparkplug 3.0.0 specification compliance. While it *should* be possible
to create Sparkplug 3.0.0-compliant applications using the Camel Tahu Components,
no claims or guarantees are expressed or implied.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifactid}</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->

== URI format

=== Edge Nodes and Devices (Producers)

.Edge Node and Device endpoints, where `groupId`, `edgeNodeId`, and `deviceId` are the Sparkplug Group, Edge Node, and Device IDs describing the Edge Node or Device.
-----
tahu-edge://groupId/edgeNodeId[/deviceId]?options
-----

.Edge Node Producer for Group 'Basic' and Edge Node 'EdgeNode' using MQTT Client ID 'EdgeClient1' connecting to Host Application 'BasicHostApp'
[caption="Example: "]
------
tahu-edge://Basic/EdgeNode?clientId=EdgeClient1&primaryHostId=BasicHostApp&deviceIds=D2,D3,D4
------

.Device Producers for Devices 'D2', 'D3', and 'D4' connected to Edge Node 'EdgeNode' in Group 'Basic', i.e. the Devices of the Edge Node in the example above
[caption="Example: "]
------
tahu-device://Basic/EdgeNode/D2
tahu-device://Basic/EdgeNode/D3
tahu-device://Basic/EdgeNode/D4
------

=== Host Applications (Consumers)

.Host Application endpoints, where `hostId` is the Sparkplug Host Application ID
-----
tahu-host://hostId?options
-----

.Host Application Consumer for Host App 'BasicHostApp' using MQTT Client ID 'HostClient1'
[caption="Example: "]
------
tahu-host:BasicHostApp?clientId=HostClient1
------

== Endpoints

Tahu component endpoints describe a Sparkplug Edge Node, Device, or Host
Application. All Sparkplug specification requirements must be observed
when defining the endpoint URIs, including allowed characters in names,
uniqueness in IDs, etc. Device IDs can include additional hierarchy with
'/' characters as allowed by the specification.

Tahu Edge Node and Device endpoints only allow Producers to be created.
Tahu Host Application endpoints only allow Consumers to be created.

== Usage

The Sparkplug 3.0.0 specification requires Sparkplug B MQTT message payloads to follow 
a Google Protobuf format with an specific structure and message order.
Many of these requirements necessitate careful Tahu Component and Endpoint
configurations.

=== Component Configuration

Tahu Component configuration is primarily composed of MQTT Server connection
information. These properties may be configured on Endpoint URIs or the Tahu
Component to cover all Endpoints created using that Component instance.

The `servers` property is a comma-separated list with the following syntax:

----
MqttServerName:[MqttClientId:](tcp|ssl)://hostname[:port],...
----

This gives a unique server name to each MQTT Server as well as its connection
scheme (`tcp` or `ssl`), hostname, and optionally the port number. A 
connection-specific MQTT Client ID may also be assigned when connecting to
this particular server. MQTT Client ID uniqueness requirements apply.

A common MQTT Client ID may also be configured through the `clientId` property
and will apply to all MQTT Server connections NOT specifying a connection-specific
`MqttClientId` in the `servers` list. Should neither the `clientId` nor the
`MqttClientId` be set, a random MQTT Client ID will be generated prefaced by
"Camel".

MQTT Client IDs are limited to 23 characters in MQTT v3.1. However, MQTT v3.1.1 increased that
limit to 256 characters. When connecting to MQTT Servers only supporting v3.1,
setting the `checkClientIdLength` flag to `true` will add a 23-character length
check to ensure proper Client ID lengths. This is a configuration-time check and
is not required to connect to MQTT v3.1 Servers.

MQTT Server authentication can be configured using the `username` and `password`
properties. TLS configuration can also be configured by providing an
`SSLContextParameters` instance or through the `useGlobalSslContextParameters`
flag.

An MQTT connection keep alive timeout can be configured using `keepAliveTimeout`.

A delay can be added between Edge Node Rebirth publishing through the
`rebirthDebounceDelay` property.
