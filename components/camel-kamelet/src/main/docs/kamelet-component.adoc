The Kamelet Component provides support for interacting with the xref:manual::route-template.adoc[Camel Route Template] engine using Endpoint semantic.

[NOTE]
====
The *kamelet* endpoint is *lenient*, which means that the endpoint accepts additional parameters that are passed to the xref:manual::route-template.adoc[Route Template] engine and consumed upon route materialization.
====

== Usage

=== Discovery

If a xref:manual::route-template.adoc[Route Template] is not found, the *kamelet* endpoint tries to load the related *kamelet* definition from the file system (by default `classpath:kamelets`). The default resolution mechanism expects _Kamelets_ files to have the extension `.kamelet.yaml`.

=== Error Handling

The error handling when using kamelets are using the same error handling
that are from the route where the kamelets are being used.

Suppose you have kamelets that would cause an exception during processing, such
as the source below. Now because the route has been configured with a _dead letter channel_
as the error handler, then the exception from the kamelet will be handled by the route error handler.
Which means you will se a WARN being logged.

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    errorHandler:
      deadLetterChannel:
        deadLetterUri: log:dead?level=WARN
    id: myRoute
    from:
      uri: "kamelet:my-error-source/source"
      steps:
        - log: "${body}"
----

For sink kamelets then error handling also allows to perform retries.

So suppose you have the following route:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    errorHandler:
      deadLetterChannel:
        deadLetterUri: log:dead?level=WARN
        redeliveryPolicy:
          maximumRedeliveries: 5
          redeliveryDelay: "5000"
    id: myRoute
    from:
      uri: "direct:start"
      steps:
        - to:
            uri: "kamelet:my-error-sink/sink"
        - log: "${body}"
----

Then notice the error handler has been configured to do redeliveries up till 5 times with 5 sec delay between.
Suppose the sink kamelet is throwing an exception, then Camel will now perform the redelivery attempt
at the point of origin, which means inside the Kamelet.

=== Calling a Kamelet from another Kamelet

NOTE: this feature is available since version 4.10.0 onward

As a Kamelet behave as any other regular component, you will be able to use it in a nested way. The definition of a Kamelet can contains the reference to another Kamelet which will give you a high level of flexibility when constructing your abstraction.

In the following example, we are creating a Kamelet which is calling a bundled catalog Kamelet `log-sink`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Kamelet
metadata:
  name: nested-sink
spec:
  definition:
    title: "Kamelet in a Kamelet"
    description: A Kamelet calling another Kamelet
    required:
      - log-level
    properties:
      log-level:
        title: The Kamelet log-sink log level
        description: The Kamelet log-sink log level
        type: string
        example: DEBUG
  dependencies:
  - "camel:core"
  - "camel:kamelet"
  template:
    from:
      uri: "kamelet:source"
      steps:
      - to: "kamelet:log-sink?level={{log-level}}"
----

According to the specification, this Kamelet expects a parameter, _log-level_ which we will use as a further parameter for the downstream call to the `log-sink` Kamelet.

The usage of this Kamelet into a Camel route is going to be the same as any other Kamelet:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "timer:yaml"
    parameters:
      period: "5000"
    steps:
      - setBody:
          simple: "Hello Camel from ${routeId}"
      - to: "kamelet:nested-sink?log-level=INFO"
----

WARNING: beware of any potential circular reference you may introduce when using chain of Kamelets, in which case, the runtime will likely be idle consuming a high amount of resources.

== Examples

_Kamelets_ can be used as if they were standard Camel components.
For example, suppose that we have created a Route Template as follows:

[source,java]
----
routeTemplate("setMyBody")
    .templateParameter("bodyValue")
    .from("kamelet:source")
        .setBody().constant("{{bodyValue}}");
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
To let the *Kamelet* component wiring the materialized route to the caller processor, we need to be able to identify the input and output endpoint of the route and this is done by using `kamelet:source` to mark the input endpoint and `kamelet:sink` for the output endpoint.
====

Then the template can be instantiated and invoked as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:setMyBody")
    .to("kamelet:setMyBody?bodyValue=myKamelet");
----


Behind the scenes, the *Kamelet* component does the following things:

1. it instantiates a route out of the Route Template identified by the given `templateId` path parameter (in this case `setMyBody`)
2. it will act like the `direct` component and connect the current route to the materialized one.

If you had to do it programmatically, it would have been something like:

[source,java]
----
routeTemplate("setMyBody")
    .templateParameter("bodyValue")
    .from("direct:{{foo}}")
        .setBody().constant("{{bodyValue}}");

TemplatedRouteBuilder.builder(context, "setMyBody")
    .parameter("foo", "bar")
    .parameter("bodyValue", "myKamelet")
    .add();

from("direct:template")
    .to("direct:bar");
