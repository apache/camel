= Slack Component

*Since Camel 2.16*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Slack component allows you to connect to an instance
of http://www.slack.com/[Slack] and delivers a message contained in the
message body via a pre
established https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks[Slack incoming
webhook].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-slack</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

To send a message to a channel.

[source,java]
------------------------
slack:#channel[?options]
------------------------

To send a direct message to a slackuser.

[source,java]
-------------------------
slack:@username[?options]
-------------------------

== Options



// component options: START
The Slack component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *webhookUrl* (common) | The incoming webhook URL |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The Slack endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
slack:channel
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *channel* | *Required* The channel name (syntax #name) or slackuser (syntax userName) to send a message directly to an user. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (29 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *maxResults* (consumer) | The Max Result for the poll | 10 | String
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *serverUrl* (consumer) | The Server URL of the Slack instance | https://slack.com | String
| *token* (consumer) | The token to use |  | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *iconEmoji* (producer) | Use a Slack emoji as an avatar |  | String
| *iconUrl* (producer) | The avatar that the component will use when sending message to a channel or user. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *username* (producer) | This is the username that the bot will have when sending messages to a channel or user. |  | String
| *webhookUrl* (producer) | The incoming webhook URL |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel
| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutorService
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. The value can be one of: none, spring, quartz | none | String
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map
| *startScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | boolean
| *timeUnit* (scheduler) | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. The value can be one of: NANOSECONDS, MICROSECONDS, MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit
| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean

== SlackComponent

The SlackComponent with XML must be configured as a Spring or Blueprint
bean that contains the incoming webhook url for the integration as a
parameter.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="slack" class="org.apache.camel.component.slack.SlackComponent">
    <property name="webhookUrl" value="https://hooks.slack.com/services/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"/>
</bean>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Java you can configure this using Java code.

== Example

A CamelContext with Blueprint could be as:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0" default-activation="lazy">

    <bean id="slack" class="org.apache.camel.component.slack.SlackComponent">
        <property name="webhookUrl" value="https://hooks.slack.com/services/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"/>
    </bean>

    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint">
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:test"/>
            <to uri="slack:#channel?iconEmoji=:camel:&amp;username=CamelTest"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>

</blueprint>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Consumer

You can use also a consumer for messages in channel

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("slack://general?token=RAW(<YOUR_TOKEN>)&maxResults=1")
    .to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll get the last message from general channel. The consumer will take track of the timestamp of the last message consumed and in the next poll it will check from that timestamp.
