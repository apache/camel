Using collections and scopes is supported only for Couchbase Server 7.0 and later.

This component is currently using Java SDK 3.x so it might be not compatible with older Couchbase servers anymore. See the compatibility https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/project-docs/compatibility.html[page].
