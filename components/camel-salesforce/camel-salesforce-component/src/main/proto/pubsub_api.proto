 * The Pub/Sub API provides a single interface for publishing and subscribing to platform events, including real-time

 * A session token is needed to authenticate. Any of the Salesforce supported
 * OAuth flows can be used to obtain a session token:
 * https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_flows.htm&type=5
 *
 * For each RPC, a client needs to pass authentication information
 * as metadata headers (https://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts/#metadata) with their method call.
 *
 * For Salesforce session token authentication, use:
 *   accesstoken : access token
 *   instanceurl : Salesforce instance URL
 *   tenantid : tenant/org id of the client
 *
 * StatusException is thrown in case of response failure for any request.

  /*
   * Bidirectional streaming RPC to subscribe to a Topic. The subscription is pull-based. A client can request
   * for more events as it consumes events. This enables a client to handle flow control based on the client's processing speed.
   *
   * Typical flow:
   * 1. Client requests for X number of events via FetchRequest.
   * 2. Server receives request and delivers events until X events are delivered to the client via one or more FetchResponse messages.
   * 3. Client consumes the FetchResponse messages as they come.
   * 4. Client issues new FetchRequest for Y more number of events. This request can
   *    come before the server has delivered the earlier requested X number of events
   *    so the client gets a continuous stream of events if any.
   *
   * If a client requests more events before the server finishes the last
   * requested amount, the server appends the new amount to the current amount of
   * events it still needs to fetch and deliver.
   *
   * A client can subscribe at any point in the stream by providing a replay option in the first FetchRequest.
   * The replay option is honored for the first FetchRequest received from a client. Any subsequent FetchRequests with a
   * new replay option are ignored. A client needs to call the Subscribe RPC again to restart the subscription
   * at a new point in the stream.
   *
   * The first FetchRequest of the stream identifies the topic to subscribe to.
   * If any subsequent FetchRequest provides topic_name, it must match what
   * was provided in the first FetchRequest; otherwise, the RPC returns an error
   * with INVALID_ARGUMENT status.

   * The server returns a PublishResponse for each PublishRequest when publish is
   * complete for the batch. A client does not have to wait for a PublishResponse
   * before sending a new PublishRequest, i.e. multiple publish batches can be queued
   * up, which allows for higher publish rate as a client can asynchronously
   * publish more events while publishes are still in flight on the server side.
   *
   * PublishResponse holds a PublishResult for each event published that indicates success
   * or failure of the publish. A client can then retry the publish as needed before sending
   * more PublishRequests for new events to publish.

   * it must make a new PublishStream call to resume publishing.
