## Undertow Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.16*

The *undertow* component provides HTTP-based
link:endpoint.html[endpoints] for consuming and producing HTTP requests.
That is, the Undertow component behaves as a simple Web server. +
 Undertow can also be used as a http client which mean you can also use
it with Camel as a producer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-undertow</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
undertow:http://hostname[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
-------------------------------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options





// component options: START
The Undertow component supports 8 options which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| **undertowHttpBinding** (advanced) | To use a custom HttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and HttpClient. |  | UndertowHttpBinding
| **sslContextParameters** (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters |  | SSLContextParameters
| **hostOptions** (advanced) | To configure common options such as thread pools |  | UndertowHostOptions
| **httpBinding** (advanced) | To use a custom HttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and HttpClient. |  | HttpBinding
| **httpConfiguration** (advanced) | To use the shared HttpConfiguration as base configuration. |  | HttpConfiguration
| **allowJavaSerialized Object** (advanced) | Whether to allow java serialization when a request uses context-type=application/x-java-serialized-object. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | boolean
| **headerFilterStrategy** (filter) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| **resolveProperty Placeholders** (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean
|=======================================================================

// endpoint options: START
The Undertow endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

    undertow:httpURI

with the following path and query parameters:

#### Path Parameters (1 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| **httpUri** | *Required* The url of the HTTP endpoint to call. |  | URI
|=======================================================================

#### Query Parameters (50 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| **chunked** (common) | If this option is false the Servlet will disable the HTTP streaming and set the content-length header on the response | true | boolean
| **disableStreamCache** (common) | Determines whether or not the raw input stream from Servlet is cached or not (Camel will read the stream into a in memory/overflow to file Stream caching) cache. By default Camel will cache the Servlet input stream to support reading it multiple times to ensure it Camel can retrieve all data from the stream. However you can set this option to true when you for example need to access the raw stream such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. DefaultHttpBinding will copy the request input stream into a stream cache and put it into message body if this option is false to support reading the stream multiple times. If you use Servlet to bridge/proxy an endpoint then consider enabling this option to improve performance in case you do not need to read the message payload multiple times. The http/http4 producer will by default cache the response body stream. If setting this option to true then the producers will not cache the response body stream but use the response stream as-is as the message body. | false | boolean
| **headerFilterStrategy** (common) | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| **transferException** (common) | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side and if the caused Exception was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | boolean
| **httpBinding** (common) | To use a custom HttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and HttpClient. |  | HttpBinding
| **async** (consumer) | Configure the consumer to work in async mode | false | boolean
| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| **httpMethodRestrict** (consumer) | Used to only allow consuming if the HttpMethod matches such as GET/POST/PUT etc. Multiple methods can be specified separated by comma. |  | String
| **matchOnUriPrefix** (consumer) | Whether or not the consumer should try to find a target consumer by matching the URI prefix if no exact match is found. | false | boolean
| **responseBufferSize** (consumer) | To use a custom buffer size on the javax.servlet.ServletResponse. |  | Integer
| **eagerCheckContentAvailable** (consumer) | Whether to eager check whether the HTTP requests has content if the content-length header is 0 or not present. This can be turned on in case HTTP clients do not send streamed data. | false | boolean
| **exceptionHandler** (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| **exchangePattern** (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| **optionsEnabled** (consumer) | Specifies whether to enable HTTP OPTIONS for this Servlet consumer. By default OPTIONS is turned off. | false | boolean
| **traceEnabled** (consumer) | Specifies whether to enable HTTP TRACE for this Servlet consumer. By default TRACE is turned off. | false | boolean
| **bridgeEndpoint** (producer) | If the option is true HttpProducer will ignore the Exchange.HTTP_URI header and use the endpoint's URI for request. You may also set the option throwExceptionOnFailure to be false to let the HttpProducer send all the fault response back. | false | boolean
| **connectionClose** (producer) | Specifies whether a Connection Close header must be added to HTTP Request. By default connectionClose is false. | false | boolean
| **copyHeaders** (producer) | If this option is true then IN exchange headers will be copied to OUT exchange headers according to copy strategy. Setting this to false allows to only include the headers from the HTTP response (not propagating IN headers). | true | boolean
| **httpMethod** (producer) | Configure the HTTP method to use. The HttpMethod header cannot override this option if set. |  | HttpMethods
| **ignoreResponseBody** (producer) | If this option is true The http producer won't read response body and cache the input stream | false | boolean
| **keepAlive** (producer) | Setting to ensure socket is not closed due to inactivity | true | Boolean
| **options** (producer) | Sets additional channel options. The options that can be used are defined in org.xnio.Options. To configure from endpoint uri then prefix each option with option. such as option.close-abort=true&option.send-buffer=8192 |  | Map
| **preserveHostHeader** (producer) | If the option is true HttpProducer will set the Host header to the value contained in the current exchange Host header useful in reverse proxy applications where you want the Host header received by the downstream server to reflect the URL called by the upstream client this allows applications which use the Host header to generate accurate URL's for a proxied service | false | boolean
| **reuseAddresses** (producer) | Setting to facilitate socket multiplexing | true | Boolean
| **tcpNoDelay** (producer) | Setting to improve TCP protocol performance | true | Boolean
| **throwExceptionOnFailure** (producer) | Option to disable throwing the HttpOperationFailedException in case of failed responses from the remote server. This allows you to get all responses regardless of the HTTP status code. | true | boolean
| **cookieHandler** (producer) | Configure a cookie handler to maintain a HTTP session |  | CookieHandler
| **okStatusCodeRange** (producer) | The status codes which is considered a success response. The values are inclusive. The range must be defined as from-to with the dash included. | 200-299 | String
| **urlRewrite** (producer) | Refers to a custom org.apache.camel.component.http.UrlRewrite which allows you to rewrite urls when you bridge/proxy endpoints. See more details at http://camel.apache.org/urlrewrite.html |  | UrlRewrite
| **mapHttpMessageBody** (advanced) | If this option is true then IN exchange Body of the exchange will be mapped to HTTP body. Setting this to false will avoid the HTTP mapping. | true | boolean
| **mapHttpMessageFormUrl EncodedBody** (advanced) | If this option is true then IN exchange Form Encoded body of the exchange will be mapped to HTTP. Setting this to false will avoid the HTTP Form Encoded body mapping. | true | boolean
| **mapHttpMessageHeaders** (advanced) | If this option is true then IN exchange Headers of the exchange will be mapped to HTTP headers. Setting this to false will avoid the HTTP Headers mapping. | true | boolean
| **synchronous** (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| **undertowHttpBinding** (advanced) | To use a custom UndertowHttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and undertow. |  | UndertowHttpBinding

### Message Headers

Camel uses the same message headers as the link:http.html[HTTP]
component. 
 From Camel 2.2, it also uses
`Exchange.HTTP_CHUNKED,CamelHttpChunked` header to turn on or turn off
the chuched encoding on the camel-undertow consumer.

Camel also populates *all* request.parameter and request.headers. For
example, given a client request with the URL,
`http://myserver/myserver?orderid=123`, the exchange will contain a
header named `orderid` with the value 123.

### Producer Example

The following is a basic example of how to send an HTTP request to an
existing HTTP endpoint.

in Java DSL

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start").to("undertow:http://www.google.com");
----------------------------------------------------------

or in Spring XML

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="undertow:http://www.google.com"/>
<route>
----------------------------------------------

### Consumer Example

In this sample we define a route that exposes a HTTP service at
`http://localhost:8080/myapp/myservice`:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="undertow:http://localhost:8080/myapp/myservice"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean"/>
</route>
--------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:*Usage of localhost*
When you specify `localhost` in a URL, Camel exposes the endpoint only
on the local TCP/IP network interface, so it cannot be accessed from
outside the machine it operates on.

If you need to expose a Jetty endpoint on a specific network interface,
the numerical IP address of this interface should be used as the host.
If you need to expose a Jetty endpoint on all network interfaces, the
`0.0.0.0` address should be used.

TIP:To listen across an entire URI prefix, see
link:how-do-i-let-jetty-match-wildcards.html[How do I let Jetty match
wildcards].


TIP:If you actually want to expose routes by HTTP and already have a
Servlet, you should instead refer to the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=46339[Servlet
Transport].
