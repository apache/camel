*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Undertow component provides HTTP and WebSocket based endpoints for consuming
and producing HTTP/WebSocket requests.

That is, the Undertow component behaves as a simple Web server.
Undertow can also be used as a http client which mean you can also use
it with Camel as a producer.

Since the component also supports WebSocket
connections, it can serve as a drop-in replacement for Camel websocket
component or atmosphere-websocket component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-undertow</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== URI format

----
undertow:http://hostname[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
undertow:https://hostname[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
undertow:ws://hostname[:port][/resourceUri][?options]
undertow:wss://hostname[:port][/resourceUri][?options]

// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
include::partial$component-configure-options.adoc[]
include::partial$component-endpoint-options.adoc[]
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START

// endpoint options: END
// component headers: START
include::partial$component-endpoint-headers.adoc[]
// component headers: END

== Message Headers

Camel uses the same message headers as the xref:http-component.adoc[HTTP]
component. It also uses `Exchange.HTTP_CHUNKED,CamelHttpChunked` header to turn on or turn off
the chunked encoding on the camel-undertow consumer.

Camel also populates *all* request.parameter and request.headers. For
example, given a client request with the URL,
`\http://myserver/myserver?orderid=123`, the exchange will contain a
header named `orderid` with the value 123.

== HTTP Producer Example

The following is a basic example of how to send an HTTP request to an
existing HTTP endpoint.

in Java DSL

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("undertow:http://www.google.com");
----

or in XML

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="undertow:http://www.google.com"/>
</route>
----

== HTTP Consumer Example

In this sample we define a route that exposes a HTTP service at
`\http://localhost:8080/myapp/myservice`:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="undertow:http://localhost:8080/myapp/myservice"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean"/>
</route>
----

== WebSocket Example

In this sample we define a route that exposes a WebSocket service at
`\http://localhost:8080/myapp/mysocket` and returns back a response to the same channel:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="undertow:ws://localhost:8080/myapp/mysocket"/>
  <transform><simple>Echo ${body}</simple></transform>
  <to uri="undertow:ws://localhost:8080/myapp/mysocket"/>
</route>
----

== Using localhost as host

When you specify `localhost` in a URL, Camel exposes the endpoint only
on the local TCP/IP network interface, so it cannot be accessed from
outside the machine it operates on.

If you need to expose an Undertow endpoint on a specific network interface,
the numerical IP address of this interface should be used as the host.
If you need to expose an Undertow endpoint on all network interfaces, the
`0.0.0.0` address should be used.

To listen across an entire URI prefix, see
xref:manual:faq:how-do-i-let-jetty-match-wildcards.adoc[How do I let Jetty match wildcards].

If you actually want to expose routes by HTTP and already have a
Servlet, you should instead refer to the
xref:servlet-component.adoc[Servlet Transport].

== Security provider

To plugin security provider for endpoint authentication, implement SPI interface
`org.apache.camel.component.undertow.spi.UndertowSecurityProvider`.

Undertow components locates all implementations of `UndertowSecurityProvider` using
Java SPI (Service Provider Interfaces). If there is an object passed to component
as parameter `securityConfiguration` and provider accepts it. Provider will be used
for authentication of all requests.

Property `requireServletContext` of security providers forces udertow server to start
with servlet context. There will be no servlet actually handled. This feature is meant only
for use with servlet filters, which needs servlet context for their functionality.
