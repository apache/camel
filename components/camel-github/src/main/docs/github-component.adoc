## GitHub Component

*Available as of Camel 2.15*

The GitHub component interacts with the GitHub API by
encapsulating http://org.eclipse.egit.github.core[egit-github]. It
currently provides polling for new pull requests, pull request comments,
tags, and commits.  It is also able to produce comments on pull
requests, as well as close the pull request entirely.

Rather than webhooks, this endpoint relies on simple polling. Reasons
include:

* Concern for reliability/stability
* The types of payloads we're polling aren't typically large (plus,
paging is available in the API)
* The need to support apps running somewhere not publicly accessible
where a webhook would fail

Note that the GitHub API is fairly expansive.  Therefore, this component
could be easily expanded to provide additional interactions.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-github</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
-----------------------------------------

Note that these can be configured directly through the endpoint.

|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| type | common |  | GitHubType | *Required* What git operation to execute
