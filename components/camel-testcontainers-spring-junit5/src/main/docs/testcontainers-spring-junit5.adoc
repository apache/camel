= Testcontainers Spring

*Available since 3.0.0*

Testing camel components is sometime complex because the 3th party system a component interacts with does not provide testing facilities and/or is only available as a native application. To reduce this complexity, *Camel Testcontainers Spring JUnit 5* extends camel spring test support providing a way to create and interact with containerized applications.

This module is an extension to the camel-testcontainers-junit5 component to add support for Spring.
Therefore see the documentation for testcontainers for more details.

== Migrating Camel Testcontainers Spring Tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5
Find below some hints to help in migrating camel testcontainers spring tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.

=== Referencing the Camel Testcontainers Spring JUnit5 library in your project
Projects using `camel-testcontainers-spring` would need to use `camel-testcontainers-spring-junit5`. For instance, maven users would update their pom.xml file as below:
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-testcontainers-spring-junit5</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Tips: It's possible to run JUnit4 & JUnit5 based camel tests side by side including the following dependencies `camel-testcontainers-spring`,
`camel-testcontainers-spring-junit5` and `junit-vintage-engine`. This configuration allows to migrate a camel test at once.

=== Typical migration steps linked to JUnit 5 support in Camel Testcontainers Spring
* Migration steps linked to xref:components::testcontainers-junit5.adoc[JUnit 5 support in Camel Testcontainers itself] should have been applied first
* Imports of `org.apache.camel.test.testcontainers.spring.\*` should be replaced with `org.apache.camel.test.testcontainers.spring.junit5.*`
