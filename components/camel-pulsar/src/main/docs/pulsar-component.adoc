== Options


// component options: START
The Pulsar component supports 7 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoConfiguration* (advanced) | The pulsar auto configuration |  | AutoConfiguration
| *pulsarClient* (advanced) | The pulsar client |  | PulsarClient
| *allowManual Acknowledgement* (consumer) | Whether to allow manual message acknowledgements. If this option is enabled, then messages are not immediately acknowledged after being consumed. Instead, an instance of PulsarMessageReceipt is stored as a header on the org.apache.camel.Exchange. Messages can then be acknowledged using PulsarMessageReceipt at any time before the ackTimeout occurs. | false | boolean
| *pulsarMessageReceipt Factory* (consumer) | Provide a factory to create an alternate implementation of PulsarMessageReceipt. |  | PulsarMessageReceiptFactory
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Pulsar endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
pulsar:persistence://tenant/namespace/topic
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (4 parameters):

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *persistence* | *Required* Whether the topic is persistent or non-persistent |  | String

| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

| *blockIfQueueFull* (producer) | Set whether the send and asyncSend operations should block when the outgoing message queue is full.

| *compressionType* (producer) | Set the compression type for the producer. | NONE | CompressionType
| *initialSequenceId* (producer) | Set the baseline for the sequence ids for messages published by the producer. First message will be using (initialSequenceId 1) as its sequence id and subsequent messages will be assigned incremental sequence ids, if not otherwise specified. | -1 | long
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *maxPendingMessages* (producer) | Set the max size of the queue holding the messages pending to receive an acknowledgment from the broker. Default is 1000. | 1000 | int
| *maxPendingMessagesAcross Partitions* (producer) | Set the number of max pending messages across all the partitions. Default is 50000. | 50000 | int
| *messageRouter* (producer) | Set a custom Message Router. |  | MessageRouter
| *messageRoutingMode* (producer) | Set the message routing mode for the producer. | RoundRobinPartition | MessageRoutingMode
| *producerName* (producer) | Name of the producer. If unset, lets Pulsar select a unique identifier. |  | String
| *sendTimeoutMs* (producer) | Send timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 30,000ms (30 seconds) | 30000 | int
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-pulsar-starter</artifactId>
