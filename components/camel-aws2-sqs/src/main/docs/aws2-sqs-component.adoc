// component options: START
The AWS 2 Simple Queue Service component supports 38 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonAWSHost* (common) | The hostname of the Amazon AWS cloud. | amazonaws.com | String
| *amazonSQSClient* (common) | To use the AmazonSQS as client |  | SqsClient
| *autoCreateQueue* (common) | Setting the autocreation of the queue | true | boolean
| *configuration* (common) | The AWS SQS default configuration |  | Sqs2Configuration
| *protocol* (common) | The underlying protocol used to communicate with SQS | https | String
| *proxyProtocol* (common) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the SQS client. The value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *queueOwnerAWSAccountId* (common) | Specify the queue owner aws account id when you need to connect the queue with different account owner. |  | String
| *region* (common) | The region in which ECS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *attributeNames* (consumer) | A list of attribute names to receive when consuming. Multiple names can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *concurrentConsumers* (consumer) | Allows you to use multiple threads to poll the sqs queue to increase throughput | 1 | int
| *defaultVisibilityTimeout* (consumer) | The default visibility timeout (in seconds) |  | Integer
| *deleteAfterRead* (consumer) | Delete message from SQS after it has been read | true | boolean
| *deleteIfFiltered* (consumer) | Whether or not to send the DeleteMessage to the SQS queue if an exchange fails to get through a filter. If 'false' and exchange does not make it through a Camel filter upstream in the route, then don't send DeleteMessage. | true | boolean
| *extendMessageVisibility* (consumer) | If enabled then a scheduled background task will keep extending the message visibility on SQS. This is needed if it takes a long time to process the message. If set to true defaultVisibilityTimeout must be set. See details at Amazon docs. | false | boolean
| *kmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds* (consumer) | The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). |  | Integer
| *kmsMasterKeyId* (consumer) | The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. |  | String
| *messageAttributeNames* (consumer) | A list of message attribute names to receive when consuming. Multiple names can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *serverSideEncryptionEnabled* (consumer) | Define if Server Side Encryption is enabled or not on the queue | false | boolean
| *visibilityTimeout* (consumer) | The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a ReceiveMessage request to set in the com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.SetQueueAttributesRequest. This only make sense if its different from defaultVisibilityTimeout. It changes the queue visibility timeout attribute permanently. |  | Integer
| *waitTimeSeconds* (consumer) | Duration in seconds (0 to 20) that the ReceiveMessage action call will wait until a message is in the queue to include in the response. |  | Integer
| *delaySeconds* (producer) | Delay sending messages for a number of seconds. |  | Integer
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *messageDeduplicationIdStrategy* (producer) | Only for FIFO queues. Strategy for setting the messageDeduplicationId on the message. Can be one of the following options: useExchangeId, useContentBasedDeduplication. For the useContentBasedDeduplication option, no messageDeduplicationId will be set on the message.

Required SQS component options

You have to provide the amazonSQSClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon's SQS].

== Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

== Usage

=== Message headers set by the SQS producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSqsMD5OfBody` |`String` |The MD5 checksum of the Amazon SQS message.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageId` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message ID.

|`CamelAwsSqsDelaySeconds` |`Integer` |The delay seconds that the Amazon SQS message can be
see by others.
|=======================================================================

=== Message headers set by the SQS consumer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSqsMD5OfBody` |`String` |The MD5 checksum of the Amazon SQS message.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageId` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message ID. 

|`CamelAwsSqsReceiptHandle` |`String` |The Amazon SQS message receipt handle.

|`CamelAwsSqsMessageAttributes` |`Map<String, String>` |The Amazon SQS message attributes.
|=======================================================================

=== Advanced AmazonSQS configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the SqsClient instance configuration, you can
create your own instance:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Creating or updating an SQS Queue

In the SQS Component, when an endpoint is started, a check is executed to obtain information 
about the existence of the queue or not. You're able to customize the creation through the QueueAttributeName 
mapping with the SQSConfiguration option.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example if the MyQueue queue is not already created on AWS (and the autoCreateQueue option is set to true), it will be created with default parameters from the 
SQS configuration. If it's already up on AWS, the SQS configuration options will be used to override the existent AWS configuration.

=== DelayQueue VS Delay for Single message

When the option delayQueue is set to true, the SQS Queue will be a DelayQueue with the
DelaySeconds option as delay. For more information about DelayQueue you can read the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html[AWS SQS documentation].
One important information to take into account is the following:

- For standard queues, the per-queue delay setting is not retroactive—changing the setting doesn't affect the delay of messages already in the queue.
- For FIFO queues, the per-queue delay setting is retroactive—changing the setting affects the delay of messages already in the queue.

as stated in the official documentation. If you want to specify a delay on single messages, you can ignore the delayQueue option, while you can set this option 
to true, if you need to add a fixed delay to all messages enqueued.

=== Server Side Encryption

There is a set of Server Side Encryption attributes for a queue. The related option are serverSideEncryptionEnabled, keyMasterKeyId and kmsDataKeyReusePeriod.
The SSE is disabled by default. You need to explicitly set the option to true and set the related parameters as queue attributes.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-sqs</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version\}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.

== JMS-style Selectors

SQS does not allow selectors, but you can effectively achieve this by
using the Camel Filter EIP and setting an
appropriate `visibilityTimeout`. When SQS dispatches a message, it will
wait up to the visibility timeout before it will try to dispatch the
message to a different consumer unless a DeleteMessage is received. By
default, Camel will always send the DeleteMessage at the end of the
route, unless the route ended in failure. To achieve appropriate
filtering and not send the DeleteMessage even on successful completion
of the route, use a Filter:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-sqs://MyQueue?amazonSQSClient=#client&defaultVisibilityTimeout=5000&deleteIfFiltered=false&deleteAfterRead=false")
.filter("${header.login} == true")
.to("mock:result");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above code, if an exchange doesn't have an appropriate header, it
will not make it through the filter AND also not be deleted from the SQS
queue. After 5000 milliseconds, the message will become visible to other
consumers.

== Available Producer Operations
- single message (default)
- sendBatchMessage
- deleteMessage
- listQueues

== Send Batch Message

You can set a `SendMessageBatchRequest` or an `Iterable`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.SQS_OPERATION, constant("sendBatchMessage")).to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=EU_WEST_1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing a `SendMessageBatchResult` instance, that you can examinate to check what messages were successfull and what not.
The id set on each message of the batch will be a Random UUID.

== Delete single Message

Use deleteMessage operation to delete a single message. You'll need to set a receipt handle header for the message you want to delete.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.SQS_OPERATION, constant("deleteMessage"))
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.RECEIPT_HANDLE, constant("123456"))
  .to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=EU_WEST_1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing a `DeleteMessageResult` instance, that you can use to check if the message was deleted or not.

== List Queues

Use listQueues operation to list queues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(SqsConstants.SQS_OPERATION, constant("listQueues")).to("aws2-sqs://camel-1?accessKey=RAW(xxx)&secretKey=RAW(xxx)&region=EU_WEST_1");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing a `ListQueuesResult` instance, that you can examinate to check the actual queues.

== Queue Autocreation

With the option `autoCreateQueue` users are able to avoid the autocreation of an SQS Queue in case it doesn't exist. The default for this option is `true`.
If set to false any operation on a not-existent queue in AWS won't be successful and an error will be returned.

== Automatic detection of SqsClient client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an SqsClient bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Send Batch Message and Message Deduplication Strategy

In case you're using a SendBatchMessage Operation, you can set two different kind of Message Deduplication Strategy:
- useExchangeId
- useContentBasedDeduplication

The first one will use a ExchangeIdMessageDeduplicationIdStrategy, that will use the Exchange ID as parameter
The other one will use a NullMessageDeduplicationIdStrategy, that will use the body as deduplication element.

In case of send batch message operation, you'll need to use the `useContentBasedDeduplication` and on the Queue you're pointing you'll need to enable the `content based deduplication` option.
