== SSH Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.10*

The SSH component enables access to SSH servers such that you can send
an SSH command, and process the response.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-ssh</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

### URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
ssh:[username[:password]@]host[:port][?options]
-----------------------------------------------

### Options



// component options: START
The SSH component supports 12 options which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (advanced) | To use the shared SSH configuration |  | SshConfiguration
| *host* (common) | Sets the hostname of the remote SSH server. |  | String

| *username* (security) | Sets the username to use in logging into the remote SSH server. |  | String
| *password* (security) | Sets the password to use in connecting to remote SSH server. Requires keyPairProvider to be set to null. |  | String
| *pollCommand* (common) | Sets the command string to send to the remote SSH server during every poll cycle. Only works with camel-ssh component being used as a consumer i.e. from(ssh://...). You may need to end your command with a newline and that must be URL encoded 0A |  | String
| *keyPairProvider* (security) | Sets the KeyPairProvider reference to use when connecting using Certificates to the remote SSH Server. |  | KeyPairProvider
| *keyType* (security) | Sets the key type to pass to the KeyPairProvider as part of authentication. KeyPairProvider.loadKey(...) will be passed this value. Defaults to ssh-rsa. |  | String
| *timeout* (common) | Sets the timeout in milliseconds to wait in establishing the remote SSH server connection. Defaults to 30000 milliseconds. |  | long
| *certFilename* (security) | *Deprecated* Sets the resource path of the certificate to use for Authentication. |  | String

// endpoint options: START
The SSH endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
ssh:host:port
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (2 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* | *Required* Sets the hostname of the remote SSH server. |  | String
| *port* | Sets the port number for the remote SSH server. | 22 | int
|===

==== Query Parameters (28 parameters):

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *failOnUnknownHost* (common) | Specifies whether a connection to an unknown host should fail or not. This value is only checked when the property knownHosts is set. | false | boolean

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. You can also specify time values using units such as 60s (60 seconds) 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds) and 1h (1 hour). | 500 | long

### Usage as a Producer endpoint

When the SSH Component is used as a Producer (`.to("ssh://...")`), it
will send the message body as the command to execute on the remote SSH
server.

Here is an example of this within the XML DSL. Note that the command has
an XML encoded newline (`&#10;`).

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------
<route id="camel-example-ssh-producer">
  <from uri="direct:exampleSshProducer"/>
  <setBody>
    <constant>features:list&#10;</constant>
  </setBody>
  <to uri="ssh://karaf:karaf@localhost:8101"/>
  <log message="${body}"/>
</route>
----------------------------------------------

### Authentication

The SSH Component can authenticate against the remote SSH server using
one of two mechanisms: Public Key certificate or username/password.
Configuring how the SSH Component does authentication is based on how
and which options are set.

1.  First, it will look to see if the `certResource` option has been
set, and if so, use it to locate the referenced Public Key certificate
and use that for authentication.
2.  If `certResource` is not set, it will look to see if a
`keyPairProvider` has been set, and if so, it will use that to for
certificate based authentication.
3.  If neither `certResource` nor `keyPairProvider` are set, it will use
the `username` and `password` options for authentication. Even though the `username` 
and `password` are provided in the endpoint configuration and headers set with 
`SshConstants.USERNAME_HEADER` (`CamelSshUsername`) and 
`SshConstants.PASSWORD_HEADER` (`CamelSshPassword`), the endpoint 
configuration is surpassed and credentials set in the headers are used.

The following route fragment shows an SSH polling consumer using a
certificate from the classpath.

In the XML DSL,

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="ssh://scott@localhost:8101?certResource=classpath:test_rsa&amp;useFixedDelay=true&amp;delay=5000&amp;pollCommand=features:list%0A"/>
  <log message="${body}"/>
</route>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Java DSL,

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("ssh://scott@localhost:8101?certResource=classpath:test_rsa&useFixedDelay=true&delay=5000&pollCommand=features:list%0A")
    .log("${body}");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of using Public Key authentication is provided in
`examples/camel-example-ssh-security`.

Certificate Dependencies

You will need to add some additional runtime dependencies if you use
certificate based authentication. The dependency versions shown are as
of Camel 2.11, you may need to use later versions depending what version
of Camel you are using.
