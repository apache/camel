Documentation Example
=====================

This example creates a bunch of routes to show how the Maven reporting
tools can visualise routes
  http://activemq.apache.org/camel/docs-example.html

This example also acts as an integration test case for the GraphViz
visualisation feature 
  http://activemq.apache.org/camel/visualisation.html

To run the example using Maven and generate the documentation type
  mvn camel:dot

To run the example using Ant and generate the documentation type
  ant

The reports should be generated in

You can see the routing rules by looking at the java code in the
src/main/java directory and the Spring XML configuration file in
src/main/resources/META-INF/spring
