Documentation Example
=====================

This example creates a bunch of routes to show how
the Maven reporting tools can visualise routes
  http://activemq.apache.org/camel/docs-example.html

This example also acts as an integration test case for the Visualisation
  http://activemq.apache.org/camel/visualisation.html

To generate the documentation type
  mvn camel:dot

The reports should be generated in
  target/site/cameldoc/index.html

You can see the routing rules by looking at the java code in the src/main/java directory
and the Spring XML configuration lives in src/main/resources/META-INF/spring

If you hit any problems please talk to us on the Camel Forums
  http://activemq.apache.org/camel/discussion-forums.html

Please help us make Apache Camel better - we appreciate any feedback you may have.
Enjoy!
