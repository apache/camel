== Embedded ActiveMQ Broker with Camel running in Apache Tomcat

=== Introduction

This example shows how you can embed Apache ActiveMQ Broker and Camel in
a web application, which can run on Apache Tomcat or other web
containers.

This example embeds ActiveMQ Broker and a Camel application which will
continuously send a message per second to an inbox queue. Then another
Camel route will route messages from the inbox to the outbox queue.

==== Camel component used in this example

* camel-core
* camel-jms
* camel-spring

=== Build

You will need to build this example first:

....
mvn install
....

=== Run

Which will create a `+.war+` file in the target directly.

You can then deploy this `+.war+` file in any web container such as
Apache Tomcat, by copying the `+.war+` file to its `+/webapp+`
directory.

This example embeds ActiveMQ Broker and a Camel application which will
continuously send a message per second to an inbox queue. Then another
Camel route will route messages from the inbox to the outbox queue.

=== Configuration

The ActiveMQ broker is configured in the
`+src/main/resources/broker.xml+` file. And the Camel application in the
`+src/main/resources/camel-context.xml+` file.
