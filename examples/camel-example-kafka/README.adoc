= Camel Kafka example

=== Introduction

An example which shows how to integrate Camel with Kakfa.

This project consists of the following examples:

  1. Send messages continuously by typing on the command line.
  2. Example of partitioner for a given producer.
  3. Topic is sent in the header as well as in the URL.


=== Preparing Kafka

This example requires that Kafka Server is up and running.

    $ ${KAFKA}/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh ${KAFKA}/config/zookeeper.properties

    $ ${KAFKA}/bin/kafka-server-start.sh ${KAFKA}/config/server.properties

You will need to create following topics before you run the examples.

On windows run

    $ ${KAFKA}/bin/kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper <zookeeper host ip>:<port> --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic TestLog
    
    $ ${KAFKA}/bin/kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper <zookeeper host ip>:<port> --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic AccessLog

On linux run
    
    $ ${KAFKA}/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper <zookeeper host ip>:<port> --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic TestLog
    
    $ ${KAFKA}/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper <zookeeper host ip>:<port> --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic AccessLog


=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

    $ mvn compile

=== Run

Run the consumer first in separate shell 

    $ mvn compile exec:java -Pkafka-consumer

Run the message producer in the seperate shell

    $ mvn compile exec:java -Pkafka-producer

Initially, some messages are sent programmatically. 
On the command prompt, type the messages. Each line is sent as one message to kafka
Press `Ctrl-C` to exit.

=== Configuration

You can configure the details in the file:
  `src/main/resources/application.properties`

You can enable verbose logging by adjusting the `src/main/resources/log4j2.properties`
  file as documented in the file.
