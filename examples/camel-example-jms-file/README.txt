JMS & File Example
==================

This example shows how to work with files and JMS. 

The example consumes messages from a queue and writes them to the file
system.
  
You will need to compile this example first:
  mvn compile
  
The example should run if you type
  mvn exec:java -PExample

After the example is complete, then there should be 10 files written
in the test directory.
