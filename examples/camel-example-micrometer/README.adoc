== Spring Java Config Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to work with Micrometer metrics, using Spring
Java Config to boot up Camel, configure the routes and meters.

The example triggers an exchange every 10s that runs through a route
using a variable delay. The exchange is measured in various ways:

* using Micrometer producers (timer and distribution summary)
* using a Route Policy Factory
* using Event Notifiers

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

....
mvn compile
....

=== Setup of Monitoring backend

This example uses https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] as monitoring
backend.

* Download the package for your platform and unpack it on your local
host
* Edit the `+prometheus.yml+` file and append another `+scrape_config+`:

....
...
  - job_name: 'camel'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8088']
....

* Start up Prometheus

Optionally, you can install a metrics visualizer,
e.g.Â https://grafana.com/[Grafana]:

* Download the package for your platform and unpack it on your local
host
* Add your Prometheus server as a data source
* Import a https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701[suitable dashboard]
* Add some graphs to display Camel metrics (this is out of scope for
this example).

=== Run

To run the example type

....
mvn exec:java
....

* You can access http://localhost:8088/metrics in order to manually
obtain the Micrometer output for Prometheus.
* In Prometheus, you can
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/examples/[query]
for one of the metrics related to Camel or the JVM.

To stop the example hit Ctrl+c

=== Configuration

You can see the routing rules by looking at the java code in the
`+src/main/java directory+`
