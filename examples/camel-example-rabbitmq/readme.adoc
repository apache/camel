= Camel Example RabbitMQ

This example shows how to work with a simple Apache Camel application that routes message to RabbitMQ.

The example generates messages using timer trigger, routes them via RabbitMQ and logs to message.

=== Configuring RabbitMQ

The sample application uses `localhost:5672` to connect to the RabbitMQ broker.
This can be configured in the `application.properties` file.

The login information is the default `guest/guest` account, which can be configured
in the `application.properties` file as well.

== How to run

The sample requires a RabbitMQ broker to be running.

You can for example easily start RabbitMQ via Docker

    docker run -it -p 5672:5672 --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit rabbitmq:3

Then you can run this example using

    mvn spring-boot:run
