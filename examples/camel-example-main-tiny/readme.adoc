= Camel Example Main Tiny

The example uses the `camel-core-engine` as dependency to use as few JARs
on the classpath as possible. For more details see the `pom.xml` file.

This example shows how to run Camel standalone via the built-in Main class.

The example also demonstrates how you can configure the Camel application
via Camel built-in dependency-injection that supports binding via the
`@BindToRegistry`, `@BeanInject` and `@PropertyInject` annotations.

Also notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.
