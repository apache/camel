== Camel Example Main XML

This example shows how to run Camel standalone (XML routes) via the built-in Main class.
The example also demonstrates how you can configure the Camel application
via Camel built-in dependency-injection that supports binding via the
`@BindToRegistry`, `@BeanInject` and `@PropertyInject` annotations.

Also notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.
