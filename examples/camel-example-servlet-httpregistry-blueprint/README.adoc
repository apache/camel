== Camel Servlet HttpRegistry Blueprint example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to use `+camel-servlet+`
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-servlet/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/servlet/HttpRegistry.java[HttpRegistry]
so that a `+CamelServlet+` can serve multiple OSGi bundles.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

....
mvn install
....

=== Run

To install Apache Camel in Karaf you type in the shell (we use version `${project.version}`):

....
feature:repo-add camel ${project.version}
feature:install camel
....

First you need to install the following features in Karaf/ServiceMix
with:

....
feature:install camel-servlet
feature:install war
....

Then you can install the example:

....
install -s mvn:org.apache.camel.example/camel-example-servlet-httpregistry-blueprint/${project.version}
....

And you can see the application running by tailing the logs

....
log:tail
....

And you can use ctrl+c to stop tailing the log.

There is a servlet that supports the following operation:

* POST /camel/services/hello - to echo the request body

From the command shell you can use `+curl+` to post a request to the
servlet as shown below:

....
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "Hello World" http://localhost:8181/camel/services/hello
....

=== Configuration

This example is implemented in XML DSL in the
`src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/camel-context.xml` file.
