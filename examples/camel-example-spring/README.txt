Spring Example
==============

This example shows how to work with files and JMS, using Spring to boot up Camel
and configure the routes.

The example consumes messages from a queue and writes them to the file system.

To run the example type
  mvn camel:run

You can see the routing rules by looking at the java code in the src/main/java directory
and the Spring XML configuration lives in src/main/resources/META-INF/spring
