Spring XQuery Example
=====================

This example shows how to

 * work with files and JMS
 * transform messages using XQuery
 * use Spring XML to configure all routing rules and components

The example consumes messages from a directory, transforms them, then sends them to a queue.

To run the example type
  mvn camel:run

You can see the routing rules by looking at the the Spring XML configuration
at src/main/resources/META-INF/spring
