# Camel Hazelcast route on Kubernetes cluster

This quickstart run in a Java standalone container, using Spring with Apache Camel (Hazelcast component).

This quickstart is based on the Kubernetes example here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/storage/hazelcast

This example is based on:

- Minikube (Kubernetes version >= 1.5)
- Fabric8 Maven Plugin (version >= 3.2)

First thing you'll need to do is preparing the environment.

Once your Minikube node is up and running you'll need to run the following command.
In your src/main/resources/fabric8/ folder you'll find two yaml file. Run the following command using them:

```
$ kubectl create -f src/main/resources/fabric8/hazelcast-service.yaml
$ kubectl create -f src/main/resources/fabric8/hazelcast-deployment.yaml
```

To check the correct startup of the Hazelcast instance run the following command:

```
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hazelcast   1         1         1            1           1m
```

and check the status of the pod

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-1638707704-n64tk   1/1       Running   0          1m
```

Now you can decide to scale-up your Hazelcast cluster

```
$ kubectl scale deployment hazelcast --replicas 4
```

and again check the status of your pods

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-1638707704-g8qwh   1/1       Running   0          1m
hazelcast-1638707704-n64tk   1/1       Running   0          3m
hazelcast-1638707704-wwwff   1/1       Running   0          1m
hazelcast-1638707704-z1g6r   1/1       Running   0          1m

```

You can also take a look at the logs from the pods:

```

### Building and running

Navigate to the project folder and the example can be built with

    $ mvn clean -Pkubernetes-install fabric8:deploy

When the example runs in fabric8, you can use the Kubectl command tool to inspect the status

To list all the running pods:

    $ kubectl get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    $ kubectl logs <name of pod>

and you should see something like this:

```

### Cleanup

Run following to undeploy

```
$ mvn -Pkubernetes-install fabric8:undeploy
$ kubectl delete -f src/main/resources/fabric8/hazelcast-deployment.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f src/main/resources/fabric8/hazelcast-service.yaml
```

Make sure no pod is running
```
