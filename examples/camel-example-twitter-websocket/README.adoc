== Twitter and Websocket Example

=== Introduction

The example is demonstrating how to poll a constant feed of twitter
searches and publish results in real time using web socket to a web
page.

This example is already configured using a testing purpose twitter
account named `cameltweet'. And therefore the example is ready to run
out of the box.

This account is only for testing purpose, and should not be used in your
custom applications. For that you need to setup and use your own twitter
account.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

....
mvn compile
....

=== Run

To run the example type

....
mvn camel:run
....

Then open a browser to see live twitter updates in the web page

http://localhost:9090

To stop the example hit ctrl+c
