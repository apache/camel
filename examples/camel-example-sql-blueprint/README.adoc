== Camel SQL Blueprint Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to exchange data using a shared database table.

The example has two Camel routes. The first route insert new data into
the table, triggered by a timer to run every 5th second.

The second route pickup the newly inserted rows from the table, process
the row(s), and mark the row(s) as processed when done; to avoid picking
up the same rows again.

This example uses Blueprint to setup and configure the database, as well
the CamelContext. You can see this in the following file: In the
