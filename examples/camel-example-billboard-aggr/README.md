# Billboard TOP100 aggregation example

### Introduction
The `billboard_lyrics_1964-2015` CSV dataset contains the TOP100 songs with lyrics for each year.  
We can compute the TOP20 artists with most songs on Billboard using Split and Aggregate EIPs.  
Build statistics is not the Camel core business but, as shown, you can easily do it!

This is the final result:
