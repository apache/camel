== Camel Servlet REST and OSGi Blueprint example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to use Servlet REST to define REST endpoints in
Camel routes using the Rest DSL

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

....
mvn install
....

=== Run

To install Apache Camel in Karaf you type in the shell (we use version
$\{project.version}):

....
feature:repo-add camel ${project.version}
feature:install camel
....

First you need to install the following features in Karaf/ServiceMix
with:

....
feature:install camel-servlet
feature:install camel-jackson
feature:install war
....

Then you can install the Camel example:

....
install -s mvn:org.apache.camel.example/camel-example-servlet-rest-blueprint/${project.version}
....

And you can see the application running by tailing the logs

....
log:tail
....

And you can use ctrl+c to stop tailing the log.

There is a user REST service that supports the following operations

* GET /user/\{id} - to view a user with the given id
* GET /user/final - to view all users
* PUT /user - to update/create an user

The view operations are HTTP GET, and update is using HTTP PUT.

From a web browser you can access the first two services using the
following links

....
  http://localhost:8181/camel-example-servlet-rest-blueprint/rest/user/123    - to view the user with id 123
  http://localhost:8181/camel-example-servlet-rest-blueprint/rest/user/findAll   - to list all users
....

From the command shell you can use curl to access the service as shown
below:

....
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8181/camel-example-servlet-rest-blueprint/rest/user/123
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8181/camel-example-servlet-rest-blueprint/rest/user/findAll
curl -X PUT -d "{ \"id\": 666, \"name\": \"The devil\"}" -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8181/camel-example-servlet-rest-blueprint/rest/user
....

=== Configuration

This example is implemented in XML DSL in the
`+src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/camel.xml+` file.
