<h2>Servlet REST and Apache Tomcat example</h2>

This example shows how to use Servlet REST to define REST endpoints in Camel routes using the Rest DSL

<br/>

This example is implemented in both the Java and XML DSLs. By default the Java DSL is in use.
You can change this in the src/main/webapps/WEB-INF/web.xml file

<br/>
For Java DSL the routes are defined in Java code, in the <tt>org.apache.camel.example.rest.UserRouteBuilder</tt> class.
And for XML DSL the routes are define in XML code, in the <tt>src/main/resources/camel-config-xml.xml</tt> file.

<p/>
There is a <i>user</i> REST service that supports the following operations
 <ul>
   <li>GET /user/{id} - to view a user with the given id </li>
   <li>GET /user/final - to view all users</li>
   <li>PUT /user - to update/create an user</li>
 </ul>

The view operations are HTTP GET, and update is using HTTP PUT.

From a web browser you can access the first two services using the following links

<ul>
  <li><a href="rest/user/123">user/123</a> - to view the user with id 123</li>
  <li><a href="rest/user/findAll">user/findAll</a> - to list all users</li>
</ul>

From the command shell you can use curl to access the service as shown below:
<pre>
    curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat/rest/user/123
    curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat/rest/user/findAll
    curl -X PUT -d "{ \"id\": 666, \"name\": \"The devil\"}" -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat/rest/user
</pre>

Notice when trying to get user with id 789 then there is a built-in delay of 0.5-2 seconds, to simulate some slowness in the service.

<p/>
This example offers an API browser using Swagger which is accessible from the following link
<ul>
  <li><a href="api-docs">api-docs</a> - overview of the apis from the REST services</li>
  <li><a href="api-docs/user">api-docs/user</a> - api of the user REST service</li>
</ul>
