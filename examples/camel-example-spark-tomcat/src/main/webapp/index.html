<h2>Spark and Apache Tomcat example</h2>

This example shows how to use Spark Java to define REST endpoints in Camel routes using the CamelSparkRouteBuilder DSL

<br/>
The routes are defined in Java code, in the <tt>org.apache.camel.example.spark.MySparkRouteBuilder</tt> class.

<p/>
There is a <i>hello</i> REST service that supports different content-type
 <ul>
   <li>text/plain</li>
   <li>text/xml</li>
   <li>application/xml</li>
 </ul>

The REST service is defined using Spark syntax as <tt>hello/:me</tt> which means that it starts with a fixed <tt>hello/</tt>
path, and then accepts a parameter which is named <b>:me</b> which will be mapped to a Camel header with key <b>me</b>.

<br/>
This allows you to access the REST service and include a parameter, for example
<p/>
    <tt>hello/world</tt>
<p/>
This means that world is the parameter.

<p/>
You can access the <i>text/plain</i> service from the web browser by clicking <a href="hello/yourname">this link</a>.
<p/>
You can try the <i>text/xml</i> or <i>application/json</i> from the command line using <b>curl</b> or similar tool.

<pre>
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/camel-example-spark-tomcat/hello/you
    curl -H "Accept: text/xml" http://localhost:8080/camel-example-spark-tomcat/hello/you
</pre>

This assume you installed the example by copying the .war as <tt>camel-example-spark-tomcat.war</tt>
into the <b>webapps</b> directory of Apache Tomcat.
