== JMX Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to work with the Camel-JMX component.

The example creates a simple MBean, registers a route to listen for
notification events on that bean and creates another route that calls
the MBean.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

....
mvn compile
....

=== Compile

To run the example type

....
mvn camel:run
....

You can see the routing rules by looking at the java code in the
`+src/main/java+` directory and the Spring XML configuration lives in
`+src/main/resources/META-INF/spring+`
