# OSGi Example - CDI

### Introduction

This example illustrates a CDI application that can be executed inside an OSGi container
using PAX CDI. This application can run unchanged as well in Java SE inside a standalone
CDI container.

The example starts an ActiveMQ in-memory broker and publishes a message when the Camel
context has started.

The example is implemented in Java with CDI dependency injection. It uses JBoss Weld
as the minimal CDI container to run the application, though you can run the application
in any CDI compliant container. In OSGi, PAX CDI is used to managed the lifecycle of
the CDI container.

The `camel-core` and `camel-sjms` components are used in this example.

### Build

You will need to build this example first:

    $ mvn install

### Run

#### Java SE

You can run this example using:

    $ mvn camel:run

When the Camel application starts, you should see the following message being logged to the console, e.g.:
```
2016-02-01 20:13:46,922 [cdi.Main.main()] INFO  DefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel 2.17-SNAPSHOT (CamelContext: osgi-example) started in 0.769 seconds
2016-02-01 20:13:47,008 [ Session Task-1] INFO  consumer-route      - Received message [Sample Message] from [Producer]
```

The Camel application can be stopped pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> in the shell.

#### OSGi / Karaf

This example can be executed within Karaf 2.x, 3.x and 4.x. From the command line:

1. In the Karaf install root directory, start Karaf:

    ```sh
    $ bin/karaf
    ```

2. For Karaf 2.x, install the following pre-requisites:

    ```
    features:addUrl mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/apache-camel/${version}/xml/features
    features:addUrl mvn:org.apache.activemq/activemq-karaf/5.12.1/xml/features
    features:install activemq-broker-noweb
    features:install pax-cdi-weld
    features:install camel-cdi
    features:install camel-sjms
    ```

3. Then install and start the example:

    ```
    osgi:install -s mvn:org.apache.camel/camel-example-cdi-osgi/${version}
    ```

Alternatively, with the new commands introduced since Karaf 3.x:

2. Install the pre-requisites:

    ```
    feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/apache-camel/${version}/xml/features
    feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.activemq/activemq-karaf/5.12.1/xml/features
    feature:install activemq-broker-noweb
    feature:install pax-cdi-weld
    feature:install camel-cdi
    feature:install camel-sjms
    ```

3. Then install and start the example:

    ```
    bundle:install -s mvn:org.apache.camel/camel-example-cdi-osgi/${version}
    ```

The following messages should be logged:

```
