Camel Groovy Router Project
===========================

To build this project use

    mvn install

To run this project from within Maven use

    mvn exec:java

The groovy source code is located in `src/main/java` which makes it
easier to integrate with Maven as the compiler will compile from this directory.

This also allows you to mix both Java and Groovy source code in this folder.

In this example we have the Camel route in the groovy source code in `MyRouteBuilder.groovy` file.
