== Camel Spring Web Services Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to expose a SOAP-based web service using Camel
and Spring Web Services.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

....
mvn clean install
....

=== Run

To run the example, you need to start up the server by typing

....
  mvn jetty:run
....

To stop the server hit ctrl+c

The web service endpoint address is: http://localhost:8080/increment

The WSDL is available at: http://localhost:8080/increment/increment.wsdl

You can test the web service using for example SOAP-UI. This excellent
tool is freely available from http://www.soapui.org. Thereâ€™s a ready to
use SOAP-UI project available in the `+client+` directory.
