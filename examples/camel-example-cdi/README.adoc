== CDI Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to work with Camel using CDI to configure
components, endpoints and beans.

A timer triggers a Camel route to run every 5th second which creates a
message that is logged to the console.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== Run

To run the example, type:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel:run
----

You can see the routing rules by looking at the java code in the
`+src/main/java+` directory.

To stop the example hit ctrl+c.

When we launch the example using the Camel Maven plugin, a standalone
CDI container is created and started.
