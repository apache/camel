== Camel Example Netty Custom Correlation

This example shows how to use TCP communication with Netty using a custom codec
to encode and decode the data over the wire.

The example also uses a single shared connection between the client and the server
to multiplex concurrent messages over the same connection. A custom correlation manager
is implemented to be able to correlate the request and response message pairs so you
do not mix-data to wrong replies.

=== How to run

You can run this example using two JVMs.

To start the server run:

    mvn compile exec:java -P server

To start the client run:

    mvn compile exec:java -P client

In the client output you should see it logs request/response pairs.
For requests that contains the word `beer` is delayed on the server side, and you
should notice that its corresponding reply is correlated correclty to its beloing request thread.
Also the messages can be inter-leaved when some messages are faster than others.
