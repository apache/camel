Camel Main
==========

This example shows how to run Camel standalone via the built-in Main class.

The example also demonstrates how you can configure the Camel application
via Camel built-in dependency-injection that supports binding via the
`@BindToRegistry`, `@BeanInject` and `@PropertyInject` annotations.

Also notice how you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

=== How to run
