== Tokenize Language

*Available as of Camel version 2.0*

The tokenizer language is a built-in language in camel-core, which is
most often used only with the link:splitter.html[Splitter] EIP to split
a message using a token-based strategy. +
The tokenizer language is intended to tokenize text documents using a
specified delimiter pattern. It can also be used to tokenize XML
documents with some limited capability. For a truly XML-aware
tokenization, the use of the link:xmltokenizer.html[XMLTokenizer]
language is recommended as it offers a faster, more efficient
tokenization specifically for XML documents. For more details
see link:splitter.html[Splitter].
