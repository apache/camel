[[Rest-RestComponent]]
Rest Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.14*

The rest component allows to define REST endpoints using the
link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] and plugin to other Camel components as the
REST transport.

[[Rest-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
  rest://method:path[:uriTemplate]?[options]
--------------------------------------------

[[Rest-URIOptions]]
URI Options
^^^^^^^^^^^

// component options: START
The REST component supports 3 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1m,7",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Java Type | Description
| componentName | String | The Camel Rest component to use for the REST transport such as restlet spark-rest. If no component has been explicit configured then Camel will lookup if there is a Camel component that integrates with the Rest DSL or if a org.apache.camel.spi.RestConsumerFactory (consumer) or org.apache.camel.spi.RestProducerFactory (producer) is registered in the registry. If either one is found then that is being used.
| apiDoc | String | The swagger api doc resource to use. The resource is loaded from classpath by default and must be in JSon format.
| host | String | Host and port of HTTP service to use (override host in swagger schema)
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The REST component supports 14 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| method | common |  | String | *Required* HTTP method to use.
| path | common |  | String | *Required* The base path
| uriTemplate | common |  | String | The uri template
| componentName | common |  | String | The Camel Rest component to use for the REST transport such as restlet spark-rest. If no component has been explicit configured then Camel will lookup if there is a Camel component that integrates with the Rest DSL or if a org.apache.camel.spi.RestConsumerFactory is registered in the registry. If either one is found then that is being used.
| consumes | common |  | String | Media type such as: 'text/xml' or 'application/json' this REST service accepts. By default we accept all kinds of types.
| inType | common |  | String | To declare the incoming POJO binding type as a FQN class name
| outType | common |  | String | To declare the outgoing POJO binding type as a FQN class name
| produces | common |  | String | Media type such as: 'text/xml' or 'application/json' this REST service returns.
| bridgeErrorHandler | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored.
| description | consumer |  | String | Human description to document this REST service
| routeId | consumer |  | String | Name of the route this REST services creates
| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored.
| exchangePattern | advanced | InOnly | ExchangePattern | Sets the default exchange pattern when creating an exchange.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
|=======================================================================

[[Rest-PathanduriTemplatesyntax]]
Path and uriTemplate syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The path and uriTemplate option is defined using a REST syntax where you
define the REST context path using support for parameters. 

TIP:If no uriTemplate is configured then path option works the same way. It
does not matter if you configure only path or if you configure both
options. Though configuring both a path and uriTemplate is a more common
practice with REST.

The following is a Camel route using a a path only

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
  from("rest:get:hello")
    .transform().constant("Bye World");
---------------------------------------

And the following route uses a parameter which is mapped to a Camel
header with the key "me".

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------
  from("rest:get:hello/{me}")
    .transform().simple("Bye ${header.me}");
--------------------------------------------

The following examples have configured a base path as "hello" and then
have two REST services configured using uriTemplates.

 

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------
  from("rest:get:hello:/{me}")
    .transform().simple("Hi ${header.me}");
 
  from("rest:get:hello:/french/{me}")
    .transform().simple("Bonjour ${header.me}");
------------------------------------------------

[[Rest-Moreexamples]]
More examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] which offers more examples and how you
can use the Rest DSL to define those in a nicer RESTful way.

There is a *camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat* example in the Apache
Camel distribution, that demonstrates how to use the
link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] with link:servlet.html[SERVLET] as
transport that can be deployed on Apache Tomcat, or similar web
containers.
