## XSLT Component

The *xslt:* component allows you to process a message using an
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt[XSLT] template. This can be ideal when using
link:templating.html[Templating] to generate respopnses for requests.

### URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------
xslt:templateName[?options]
---------------------------

Where *templateName* is the classpath-local URI of the template to
invoke; or the complete URL of the remote template. Refer to the
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/core/io/DefaultResourceLoader.html[Spring
Documentation for more detail of the URI syntax]

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

Here are some example URIs

URI

Description

[source,java]
-----------------------------
xslt:com/acme/mytransform.xsl
-----------------------------

refers to the file com/acme/mytransform.xsl on the classpath

[source,java]
------------------------
xslt:file:///foo/bar.xsl
------------------------

refers to the file /foo/bar.xsl

[source,java]
-----------------------------------
xslt:http://acme.com/cheese/foo.xsl
-----------------------------------

refers to the remote http resource

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component when using *Camel 2.8* or older:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

From Camel 2.9 onwards the link:xslt.html[XSLT] component is provided
directly in the camel-core.

### Options

// component options: START
The XSLT component supports 5 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| xmlConverter | advanced |  | XmlConverter | To use a custom implementation of org.apache.camel.converter.jaxp.XmlConverter
| uriResolverFactory | advanced |  | XsltUriResolverFactory | To use a custom javax.xml.transform.URIResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI or which is a subclass of XsltUriResolver. Do not use in combination with uriResolver. See also link setUriResolver(URIResolver).
| uriResolver | advanced |  | URIResolver | To use a custom javax.xml.transform.URIResolver. Do not use in combination with uriResolverFactory. See also link setUriResolverFactory(XsltUriResolverFactory).
| contentCache | producer | true | boolean | Cache for the resource content (the stylesheet file) when it is loaded. If set to false Camel will reload the stylesheet file on each message processing. This is good for development. A cached stylesheet can be forced to reload at runtime via JMX using the clearCachedStylesheet operation.
| saxon | producer | false | boolean | Whether to use Saxon as the transformerFactoryClass. If enabled then the class net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl. You would need to add Saxon to the classpath.
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The XSLT component supports 17 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| resourceUri | producer |  | String | *Required* The name of the template to load from classpath or file system
| allowStAX | producer | true | boolean | Whether to allow using StAX as the javax.xml.transform.Source.
| contentCache | producer | true | boolean | Cache for the resource content (the stylesheet file) when it is loaded. If set to false Camel will reload the stylesheet file on each message processing. This is good for development. A cached stylesheet can be forced to reload at runtime via JMX using the clearCachedStylesheet operation.
| deleteOutputFile | producer | false | boolean | If you have output=file then this option dictates whether or not the output file should be deleted when the Exchange is done processing. For example suppose the output file is a temporary file then it can be a good idea to delete it after use.
| failOnNullBody | producer | true | boolean | Whether or not to throw an exception if the input body is null.
| output | producer | string | XsltOutput | Option to specify which output type to use. Possible values are: string bytes DOM file. The first three options are all in memory based where as file is streamed directly to a java.io.File. For file you must specify the filename in the IN header with the key Exchange.XSLT_FILE_NAME which is also CamelXsltFileName. Also any paths leading to the filename must be created beforehand otherwise an exception is thrown at runtime.
| saxon | producer | false | boolean | Whether to use Saxon as the transformerFactoryClass. If enabled then the class net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl. You would need to add Saxon to the classpath.
| transformerCacheSize | producer | 0 | int | The number of javax.xml.transform.Transformer object that are cached for reuse to avoid calls to Template.newTransformer().
| converter | advanced |  | XmlConverter | To use a custom implementation of org.apache.camel.converter.jaxp.XmlConverter
| entityResolver | advanced |  | EntityResolver | To use a custom org.xml.sax.EntityResolver with javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource.
| errorListener | advanced |  | ErrorListener | Allows to configure to use a custom javax.xml.transform.ErrorListener. Beware when doing this then the default error listener which captures any errors or fatal errors and store information on the Exchange as properties is not in use. So only use this option for special use-cases.
| resultHandlerFactory | advanced |  | ResultHandlerFactory | Allows you to use a custom org.apache.camel.builder.xml.ResultHandlerFactory which is capable of using custom org.apache.camel.builder.xml.ResultHandler types.
| saxonExtensionFunctions | advanced |  | String | Allows you to use a custom net.sf.saxon.lib.ExtensionFunctionDefinition. You would need to add camel-saxon to the classpath. The function is looked up in the registry where you can comma to separate multiple values to lookup.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
| transformerFactory | advanced |  | TransformerFactory | To use a custom XSLT transformer factory
| transformerFactoryClass | advanced |  | String | To use a custom XSLT transformer factory specified as a FQN class name
| uriResolver | advanced |  | URIResolver | To use a custom javax.xml.transform.URIResolver
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// endpoint options: END


### Using XSLT endpoints

For example you could use something like

[source,java]
--------------------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("xslt:com/acme/mytransform.xsl");
--------------------------------------

To use an XSLT template to formulate a response for a message for InOut
message exchanges (where there is a `JMSReplyTo` header).

If you want to use InOnly and consume the message and send it to another
destination you could use the following route:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("xslt:com/acme/mytransform.xsl").
  to("activemq:Another.Queue");
--------------------------------------

### Getting Parameters into the XSLT to work with

By default, all headers are added as parameters which are available in
the XSLT. +
 To do this you will need to declare the parameter so it is then
_useable_.

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<setHeader headerName="myParam"><constant>42</constant></setHeader>
<to uri="xslt:MyTransform.xsl"/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

And the XSLT just needs to declare it at the top level for it to be
available:

[source,xml]
------------------------------
<xsl: ...... >

   <xsl:param name="myParam"/>
  
    <xsl:template ...>
------------------------------

### Spring XML versions

To use the above examples in Spring XML you would use something like

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  <camelContext xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    <route>
      <from uri="activemq:My.Queue"/>
      <to uri="xslt:org/apache/camel/spring/processor/example.xsl"/>
      <to uri="activemq:Another.Queue"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/XsltTest.java[test
case] along with
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/XsltTest-context.xml[its
Spring XML] if you want a concrete example.

### Using xsl:include

*Camel 2.2 or older* +
 If you use xsl:include in your XSL files then in Camel 2.2 or older it
uses the default `javax.xml.transform.URIResolver` which means it can
only lookup files from file system, and its does that relative from the
JVM starting folder.

For example this include:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------
<xsl:include href="staff_template.xsl"/>
----------------------------------------

Will lookup the `staff_tempkalte.xsl` file from the starting folder
where the application was started.

*Camel 2.3 or newer*  +
 Now Camel provides its own implementation of `URIResolver` which allows
Camel to load included files from the classpath and more intelligent
than before.

For example this include:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------
<xsl:include href="staff_template.xsl"/>
----------------------------------------

Will now be located relative from the starting endpoint, which for
example could be:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
.to("xslt:org/apache/camel/component/xslt/staff_include_relative.xsl")
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Which means Camel will locate the file in the *classpath* as
`org/apache/camel/component/xslt/staff_template.xsl`. +
 This allows you to use xsl include and have xsl files located in the
same folder such as we do in the example
`org/apache/camel/component/xslt`.

You can use the following two prefixes `classpath:` or `file:` to
instruct Camel to look either in classpath or file system. If you omit
the prefix then Camel uses the prefix from the endpoint configuration.
If that neither has one, then classpath is assumed.

You can also refer back in the paths such as

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------
    <xsl:include href="../staff_other_template.xsl"/>
-----------------------------------------------------

Which then will resolve the xsl file under `org/apache/camel/component`.

#### Using xsl:include and default prefix

When using xsl:include such as:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------
<xsl:include href="staff_template.xsl"/>
----------------------------------------

Then in Camel 2.10.3 and older, then Camel will use "classpath:" as the
default prefix, and load the resource from the classpath. This works for
most cases, but if you configure the starting resource to load from
file,

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------
.to("xslt:file:etc/xslt/staff_include_relative.xsl")
----------------------------------------------------

.. then you would have to prefix all your includes with "file:" as well.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------
<xsl:include href="file:staff_template.xsl"/>
---------------------------------------------

From Camel 2.10.4 onwards we have made this easier as Camel will use the
prefix from the endpoint configuration as the default prefix. So from
Camel 2.10.4 onwards you can do:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------
<xsl:include href="staff_template.xsl"/>
----------------------------------------

Which will load the staff_template.xsl resource from the file system, as
the endpoint was configured with "file:" as prefix. +
 You can still though explicit configure a prefix, and then mix and
match. And have both file and classpath loading. But that would be
unusual, as most people either use file or classpath based resources.

### Using Saxon extension functions

Since Saxon 9.2, writing extension functions has been supplemented by a
new mechanism, referred to
as http://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/extensibility/integratedfunctions[integrated
extension functions] you can now easily use camel:

 

- Java example:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SimpleRegistry registry = new SimpleRegistry();
registry.put("function1", new MyExtensionFunction1());
registry.put("function2", new MyExtensionFunction2());

CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext(registry);
context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("direct:start")
            .to("xslt:org/apache/camel/component/xslt/extensions/extensions.xslt?saxonExtensionFunctions=#function1,#function2");
    }
});
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Spring example:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:extensions"/>
    <to uri="xslt:org/apache/camel/component/xslt/extensions/extensions.xslt?saxonExtensionFunctions=#function1,#function2"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>


<bean id="function1" class="org.apache.camel.component.xslt.extensions.MyExtensionFunction1"/>
<bean id="function2" class="org.apache.camel.component.xslt.extensions.MyExtensionFunction2"/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

 

### Dynamic stylesheets

To provide a dynamic stylesheet at runtime you can define a dynamic URI.
See link:how-to-use-a-dynamic-uri-in-to.html[How to use a dynamic URI in
to()] for more information.

*Available as of Camel 2.9 (removed in 2.11.4, 2.12.3 and 2.13.0)* +
 Camel provides the `CamelXsltResourceUri` header which you can use to
define a stylesheet to use instead of what is configured on the endpoint
URI. This allows you to provide a dynamic stylesheet at runtime.

### Accessing warnings, errors and fatalErrors from XSLT ErrorListener

*Available as of Camel 2.14*

From Camel 2.14 onwards, any warning/error or fatalError is stored on
the current Exchange as a property with the
keys `Exchange.XSLT_ERROR`, `Exchange.XSLT_FATAL_ERROR`,
or `Exchange.XSLT_WARNING` which allows end users to get hold of any
errors happening during transformation.

For example in the stylesheet below, we want to terminate if a staff has
an empty dob field. And to include a custom error message using
xsl:message.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <xsl:template match="/">
    <html>
      <body>
        <xsl:for-each select="staff/programmer">
          <p>Name: <xsl:value-of select="name"/><br />
            <xsl:if test="dob=''">
              <xsl:message terminate="yes">Error: DOB is an empty string!</xsl:message>
            </xsl:if>
          </p>
        </xsl:for-each>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information is not available on the Exchange stored as an Exception
that contains the message in the `getMessage()` method on the exception.
The exception is stored on the Exchange as a warning with the
key `Exchange.XSLT_WARNING.`

### Notes on using XSLT and Java Versions

Here are some observations from Sameer, a Camel user, which he kindly
shared with us:

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In case anybody faces issues with the XSLT endpoint please review these
points.

I was trying to use an xslt endpoint for a simple transformation from
one xml to another using a simple xsl. The output xml kept appearing
(after the xslt processor in the route) with outermost xml tag with no
content within.

No explanations show up in the DEBUG logs. On the TRACE logs however I
did find some error/warning indicating that the XMLConverter bean could
no be initialized.

After a few hours of cranking my mind, I had to do the following to get
it to work (thanks to some posts on the users forum that gave some
clue):

\1. Use the transformerFactory option in the route
`("xslt:my-transformer.xsl?transformerFactory=tFactory")` with the
`tFactory` bean having bean defined in the spring context for
`class="org.apache.xalan.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl"`. +
 2. Added the Xalan jar into my maven pom.

My guess is that the default xml parsing mechanism supplied within the
JDK (I am using 1.6.0_03) does not work right in this context and does
not throw up any error either. When I switched to Xalan this way it
works. This is not a Camel issue, but might need a mention on the xslt
component page.

Another note, jdk 1.6.0_03 ships with JAXB 2.0 while Camel needs 2.1.
One workaround is to add the 2.1 jar to the `jre/lib/endorsed` directory
for the jvm or as specified by the container.

Hope this post saves newbie Camel riders some time.
