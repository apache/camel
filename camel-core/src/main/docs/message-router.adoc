Message Router
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageRouter.html[Message
Router] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns]
allows you to consume from an input destination, evaluate some predicate
then choose the right output destination.

The following example shows how to route a request from an input
*queue:a* endpoint to either *queue:b*, *queue:c* or *queue:d* depending
on the evaluation of various link:predicate.html[Predicate] expressions

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

[[MessageRouter-Choicewithoutotherwise]]
Choice without otherwise
++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you use a `choice` without adding an `otherwise`, any unmatched
exchanges will be dropped by default.

[[MessageRouter-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
