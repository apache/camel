Message Bus
^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PointToPointChannel.html[Message
Bus] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns].
You could view Camel as a Message Bus itself as it allows producers and
consumers to be decoupled.

Folks often assume that a Message Bus is a JMS though so you may wish to
refer to the link:jms.html[JMS] component for traditional MOM support. +
 Also worthy of note is the link:xmpp.html[XMPP] component for
supporting messaging over XMPP (Jabber)

Of course there are also ESB products such as
http://servicemix.apache.org/home.html[Apache ServiceMix] which serve as
full fledged message busses. +
 You can interact with http://servicemix.apache.org/home.html[Apache
ServiceMix] from Camel in many ways, but in particular you can use the
link:nmr.html[NMR] or link:jbi.html[JBI] component to access the
ServiceMix message bus directly.

 

[[MessageBus-Example]]
Example
+++++++

The following demonstrates how the Camel message bus can be used to
communicate with consumers and producers

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
    .pollEnrich("file:inbox?fileName=data.txt")
    .to("jms:queue:foo");
-----------------------------------------------

**Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]**

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <pollEnrich uri="file:inbox?fileName=data.txt"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
</route>
----------------------------------------------------

[[MessageBus-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
