[[CorrelationIdentifier-CorrelationIdentifier]]
== Correlation Identifier

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CorrelationIdentifier.html[Correlation
Identifier] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns] by getting or setting a header on a
link:message.html[Message].

When working with the link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] or link:jms.html[JMS]
components the correlation identifier header is called
*JMSCorrelationID*. You can add your own correlation identifier to any
message exchange to help correlate messages together to a single
conversation (or business process).

The use of a Correlation Identifier is key to working with the
link:bam.html[Camel Business Activity Monitoring Framework] and can also
be highly useful when testing with simulation or canned data such as
with the link:mock.html[Mock testing framework]

Some link:eip.html[EIP] patterns will spin off a sub message, and in
those cases, Camel will add a correlation id on the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] as a property with they key
`Exchange.CORRELATION_ID`, which links back to the source
link:exchange.html[Exchange]. For example the
link:splitter.html[Splitter], link:multicast.html[Multicast],
link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List], and link:wire-tap.html[Wire
Tap] EIP does this.

The following example demonstrates using the Camel JMSMessageID as the
Correlation Identifier within a request/reply pattern in
the link:jms.html[JMS] component

=== Samples

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to(ExchangePattern.InOut, "jms:queue:foo?useMessageIDAsCorrelationID=true")
    .to("mock:result");
----

And with XML:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to pattern="InOut" uri="jms:queue:foo?useMessageIDAsCorrelationID=true"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
