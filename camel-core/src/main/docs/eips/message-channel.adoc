== Message Channel

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageChannel.html[Message
Channel] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns]. The Message Channel is an internal implementation detail of
the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface and all interactions with the Message Channel are via the
Endpoint interfaces.

=== Samples

In JMS, Message Channels are represented by topics and queues such as
the following

[source,text]
-------------
jms:queue:foo
-------------

This message channel can be then used within the
link:jms.html[JMS] component

And the following shows a little Java route snippet:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:foo")
    .to("jms:queue:foo")
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:foo">
  <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
</route>
----
