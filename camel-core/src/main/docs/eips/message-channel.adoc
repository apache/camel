Message Channel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageChannel.html[Message
Channel] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns]. The Message Channel is an internal implementation detail of
the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface and all interactions with the Message Channel are via the
Endpoint interfaces.

*Example*

In JMS, Message Channels are represented by topics and queues such as
the following

[source,text]
-------------
jms:queue:foo
-------------

This message channel can be then used within the
link:jms.html[JMS] component

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

[source,java]
-------------------
to("jms:queue:foo")
-------------------

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

[source,xml]
-------------------------
<to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
-------------------------

For more details see

* link:message.html[Message]
* link:message-endpoint.html[Message Endpoint]

[[MessageChannel-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
