== Pipes and Filters

Camel supports the link:http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PipesAndFilters.html[Pipes and Filters] from the link:https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/docs/user-manual/en/enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns] in various ways.

With Camel you can split your processing across multiple independent
link:https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/docs/user-manual/en/endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] instances which can then be chained
together.

=== Samples

You can create pipelines of logic using multiple
link:https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/docs/user-manual/en/endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] or link:https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/docs/eips/message-translator.adoc[Message
Translator] instances as follows

Though pipeline is the default mode of operation when you specify
multiple outputs in Camel. The opposite to pipeline is multicast; which
fires the same message into each of its outputs. (See the example
below).

In Java you do:
[source,java]
----
from("activemq:SomeQueue")
    .pipeline()
    .bean("foo")
    .bean("bar")
    .to("acitvemq:OutputQueueu");
----

The pipeline is the default mode, which can be omitted, and therefore you almost often write as:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:SomeQueue")
    .bean("foo")
    .bean("bar")
    .to("acitvemq:OutputQueueu");
----

In XML you can use the `<pipeline>` element

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="activemq:SomeQueue"/>
  <pipeline>
    <bean ref="foo"/>
    <bean ref="bar"/>
    <to uri="activemq:OutputQueue"/>
  </pipeline>
</route>
----

In the above the pipeline element is actually unnecessary, you could use this:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="activemq:SomeQueue"/>
  <bean ref="foo"/>
  <bean ref="bar"/>
  <to uri="activemq:OutputQueue"/>
</route>
----

Its just a bit more explicit. However if you wish to use `<multicast/>` to
avoid a pipeline - to send the same message into multiple pipelines -
then the `<pipeline>` element comes into its own.

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="activemq:SomeQueue"/>
  <multicast>
    <pipeline>
      <bean ref="something"/>
      <to uri="log:Something"/>
    </pipeline>
    <pipeline>
      <bean ref="foo"/>
      <bean ref="bar"/>
      <to uri="activemq:OutputQueue"/>
    </pipeline>
  </multicast>
</route>
----
