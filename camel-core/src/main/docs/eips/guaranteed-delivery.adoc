== Guaranteed Delivery

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/GuaranteedMessaging.html[Guaranteed
Delivery] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns] using among others the following components:

* link:file2.html[File] for using file systems as a persistent store of
messages
* link:jms.html[JMS] when using persistent delivery (the default) for
working with JMS Queues and Topics for high performance, clustering and
load balancing
* link:jpa.html[JPA] for using a database as a persistence layer, or use
any of the many other database component such as link:sql.html[SQL],
link:jdbc.html[JDBC],
link:mybatis.html[MyBatis],
link:hibernate.html[Hibernate]
* link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] for a lightweight key-value persistent store

[[GuaranteedDelivery-Example]]
=== Example

The following example demonstrates illustrates the use
of http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/GuaranteedMessaging.html[Guaranteed
Delivery] within the link:jms.html[JMS] component. By default, a message
is not considered successfully delivered until the recipient has
persisted the message locally guaranteeing its receipt in the event the
destination becomes unavailable.
