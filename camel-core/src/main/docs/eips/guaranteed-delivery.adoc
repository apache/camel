Guaranteed Delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/GuaranteedMessaging.html[Guaranteed
Delivery] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns] using among others the following components:

* link:file2.html[File] for using file systems as a persistent store of
messages
* link:jms.html[JMS] when using persistent delivery (the default) for
working with JMS Queues and Topics for high performance, clustering and
load balancing
* link:jpa.html[JPA] for using a database as a persistence layer, or use
any of the many other database component such as link:sql.html[SQL],
link:jdbc.html[JDBC],
link:ibatis.html[iBATIS]/link:mybatis.html[MyBatis],
link:hibernate.html[Hibernate]
* link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] for a lightweight key-value persistent store

[[GuaranteedDelivery-Example]]
Example
+++++++

The following example demonstrates illustrates the use
of http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/GuaranteedMessaging.html[Guaranteed
Delivery] within the link:jms.html[JMS] component. By default, a message
is not considered successfully delivered until the recipient has
persisted the message locally guaranteeing its receipt in the event the
destination becomes unavailable.

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

[source,java]
-------------------------
from("direct:start")
    .to("jms:queue:foo");
-------------------------

 

**Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]**

[source,xml]
------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
</route>
------------------------------

[[GuaranteedDelivery-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
