== Simple Language

*Available as of Camel version 1.1*

The Simple Expression Language was a really simple language when it was
created, but has since grown more powerful. It is primarily intended for
being a really small and simple language for evaluating
Expressions and Predicates
without requiring any new dependencies or knowledge of
<<xpath-language,XPath>>; so it is ideal for testing in camel-core. The
idea was to cover 95% of the common use cases when you need a little bit
of expression based script in your Camel routes.

However for much more complex use cases you are generally recommended to
choose a more expressive and powerful language such as:

* <<spel-language,SpEL>>
* <<mvel-component,Mvel>>
* <<groovy-language,Groovy>>
* JavaScript
* <<el-language,EL>>
* <<ognl-language,OGNL>>
* one of the supported link:scripting-languages.html[Scripting
Languages]

The simple language uses `${body`} placeholders for complex expressions
where the expression contains constant literals. The $\{ } placeholders
can be omitted if the expression is only the token itself.

TIP: *Alternative syntax* From Camel 2.5 onwards you can also use the alternative syntax which
uses `$simple{ }` as placeholders. This can be used in situations to avoid clashes when using for example
Spring property placeholder together with Camel.


=== Simple Language Changes in Camel 2.9 onwards

The <<simple-language,Simple>> language have been improved from Camel 2.9
onwards to use a better syntax parser, which can do index precise error
messages, so you know exactly what is wrong and where the problem is.
For example if you have made a typo in one of the operators, then
previously the parser would not be able to detect this, and cause the
evaluation to be true. There are a few changes in the syntax which are
no longer backwards compatible. When using <<simple-language,Simple>>
language as a Predicate then the literal text
*must* be enclosed in either single or double quotes. For example:
`"${body} == 'Camel'"`. Notice how we have single quotes around the
literal. The old style of using `"body"` and `"header.foo"` to refer to
the message body and header is @deprecated, and it is encouraged to
always use $\{ } tokens for the built-in functions.
The range operator now requires the range to be in single quote as well
as shown: `"${header.zip} between '30000..39999'"`.

To get the body of the in message: `"body"`, or `"in.body"` or
`"${body}"`.

A complex expression must use $\{ } placeholders, such as:
`"Hello ${in.header.name} how are you?"`.

You can have multiple functions in the same expression:
`"Hello ${in.header.name} this is ${in.header.me} speaking"`. +
 However you can *not* nest functions in Camel 2.8.x or older (i.e.
having another $\{ } placeholder in an existing, is not allowed). +
 From *Camel 2.9* onwards you can nest functions.

includes the route strack-trace). This can be used if you do not want to
log sensitive data from the message itself.
|=======================================================================

=== OGNL expression support

*Available as of Camel 2.3*

INFO:Camel's OGNL support is for invoking methods only. You cannot access
fields. From *Camel 2.11.1* onwards we added special support for accessing the
length field of Java arrays.


The <<simple-language,Simple>> and <<simple-language,Bean>> language now
supports a Camel OGNL notation for invoking beans in a chain like
fashion. Suppose the Message IN body contains a POJO which has a `getAddress()`
method.

Then you can use Camel OGNL notation to access the address object:

[source,java]
--------------------------------
simple("${body.address}")
simple("${body.address.street}")
simple("${body.address.zip}")
--------------------------------

Camel understands the shorthand names for getters, but you can invoke
any method or use the real name such as:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------
simple("${body.address}")
simple("${body.getAddress.getStreet}")
simple("${body.address.getZip}")
simple("${body.doSomething}")
--------------------------------------

You can also use the null safe operator (`?.`) to avoid NPE if for
example the body does NOT have an address

[source,java]
----------------------------------
simple("${body?.address?.street}")
----------------------------------

It is also possible to index in `Map` or `List` types, so you can do:

[source,java]
---------------------------
simple("${body[foo].name}")
---------------------------

To assume the body is `Map` based and lookup the value with `foo` as
key, and invoke the `getName` method on that value.

If the key has space, then you *must* enclose the key with quotes, for
example 'foo bar':

[source,java]
---------------------------------
simple("${body['foo bar'].name}")
---------------------------------

You can access the `Map` or `List` objects directly using their key name
(with or without dots) :

[source,java]
------------------------------
simple("${body[foo]}")
simple("${body[this.is.foo]}")
------------------------------

Suppose there was no value with the key `foo` then you can use the null
safe operator to avoid the NPE as shown:

[source,java]
----------------------------
simple("${body[foo]?.name}")
----------------------------

You can also access `List` types, for example to get lines from the
address you can do:

[source,java]
----------------------------------
simple("${body.address.lines[0]}")
simple("${body.address.lines[1]}")
simple("${body.address.lines[2]}")
----------------------------------

There is a special `last` keyword which can be used to get the last
value from a list.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------
simple("${body.address.lines[last]}")
-------------------------------------

And to get the 2nd last you can subtract a number, so we can use
`last-1` to indicate this:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
simple("${body.address.lines[last-1]}")
---------------------------------------

And the 3rd last is of course:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
simple("${body.address.lines[last-2]}")
---------------------------------------

And you can call the size method on the list with

[source,java]
------------------------------------
simple("${body.address.lines.size}")
------------------------------------

From *Camel 2.11.1* onwards we added support for the length field for
Java arrays as well, eg:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------
String[] lines = new String[]{"foo", "bar", "cat"};
exchange.getIn().setBody(lines);

simple("There are ${body.length} lines")
---------------------------------------------------

And yes you can combine this with the operator support as shown below:

[source,java]
------------------------------------
simple("${body.address.zip} > 1000")
------------------------------------

=== Operator support

The parser is limited to only support a single operator.

To enable it the left value must be enclosed in $\{ }. The syntax is:

[source]
--------------------------
${leftValue} OP rightValue
--------------------------

Where the `rightValue` can be a String literal enclosed in `' '`,
`null`, a constant value or another expression enclosed in $\{ }.

IMPORTANT: There *must* be spaces around the operator.

Camel will automatically type convert the rightValue type to the
leftValue type, so it is able to eg. convert a string into a numeric so
you can use > comparison for numeric values.

The following operators are supported:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Operator |Description

|== |equals

|=~ |*Camel 2.16:* equals ignore case (will ignore case when comparing String
values)

|> |greater than

|>= |greater than or equals

|< |less than

|<= |less than or equals

|!= |not equals

|contains |For testing if contains in a string based value

|not contains |For testing if not contains in a string based value

|~~ |For testing if contains by ignoring case sensitivity in a string based value

|regex |For matching against a given regular expression pattern defined as a
String value

|not regex |For not matching against a given regular expression pattern defined as a
String value

|in |For matching if in a set of values, each element must be separated by
comma. If you want to include an empty value, then it must be defined using double comma, eg ',,bronze,silver,gold', which
is a set of four values with an empty value and then the three medals.

|not in |For matching if not in a set of values, each element must be separated
by comma. If you want to include an empty value, then it must be defined using double comma, eg ',,bronze,silver,gold', which
is a set of four values with an empty value and then the three medals.

|is |For matching if the left hand side type is an instanceof the value.

|not is |For matching if the left hand side type is not an instanceof the value.

|range |For matching if the left hand side is within a range of values defined
as numbers: `from..to`. From *Camel 2.9* onwards the range values must
be enclosed in single quotes.

|not range |For matching if the left hand side is not within a range of values
defined as numbers: `from..to`. From *Camel 2.9* onwards the range
values must be enclosed in single quotes.

|starts with |*Camel 2.17.1, 2.18*: For testing if the left hand side string starts
with the right hand string.

|ends with |*Camel 2.17.1, 2.18*: For testing if the left hand side string ends with
the right hand string.
|===

And the following unary operators can be used:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Operator |Description

|++ |*Camel 2.9:* To increment a number by one. The left hand side must be a
function, otherwise parsed as literal.

|-- |*Camel 2.9:* To decrement a number by one. The left hand side must be a
function, otherwise parsed as literal.

|\ |*Camel 2.9.3 to 2.10.x* To escape a value, eg \$, to indicate a $ sign.
Special: Use \n for new line, \t for tab, and \r for carriage return.
*Notice:* Escaping is *not* supported using the
<<file-language,File Language>>. *Notice:* From Camel 2.11
onwards the escape character is no longer support, but replaced with the
following three special escaping.

|\n |*Camel 2.11:* To use newline character.

|\t |*Camel 2.11:* To use tab character.

|\r |*Camel 2.11:* To use carriage return character.

|\} |*Camel 2.18:* To use the } character as text
|===

And the following logical operators can be used to group expressions:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Operator |Description

|and |*deprecated* use && instead. The logical and operator is used to group
two expressions.

|or |*deprecated* use \|\| instead. The logical or operator is used to group
two expressions.

|&& |*Camel 2.9:* The logical and operator is used to group two expressions.

| \|\| |*Camel 2.9:* The logical or operator is used to group two expressions.
|===

IMPORTANT: *Using and,or operators* In *Camel 2.4 or older* the `and` or `or` can only be used *once* in a
simple language expression. From *Camel 2.5* onwards you can use these
operators multiple times.

The syntax for AND is:

[source]
----------------------------------------------------------
${leftValue} OP rightValue and ${leftValue} OP rightValue 
----------------------------------------------------------

And the syntax for OR is:

[source]
---------------------------------------------------------
${leftValue} OP rightValue or ${leftValue} OP rightValue 
---------------------------------------------------------

Some examples:

[source,java]
----
// exact equals match
simple("${in.header.foo} == 'foo'")

// ignore case when comparing, so if the header has value FOO this will match
simple("${in.header.foo} =~ 'foo'")

// here Camel will type convert '100' into the type of in.header.bar and if it is an Integer '100' will also be converter to an Integer
simple("${in.header.bar} == '100'")

simple("${in.header.bar} == 100")

// 100 will be converter to the type of in.header.bar so we can do > comparison
simple("${in.header.bar} > 100")
----

==== Comparing with different types

When you compare with different types such as String and int, then you
have to take a bit care. Camel will use the type from the left hand side
as 1st priority. And fallback to the right hand side type if both values
couldn't be compared based on that type. +
 This means you can flip the values to enforce a specific type. Suppose
the bar value above is a String. Then you can flip the equation:

[source,java]
----
simple("100 < ${in.header.bar}")
----

which then ensures the int type is used as 1st priority.

This may change in the future if the Camel team improves the binary
comparison operations to prefer numeric types over String based. It's
most often the String type which causes problem when comparing with
numbers.

[source,java]
----
// testing for null
simple("${in.header.baz} == null")

// testing for not null
simple("${in.header.baz} != null")
----

And a bit more advanced example where the right value is another
expression

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.date} == ${date:now:yyyyMMdd}")

simple("${in.header.type} == ${bean:orderService?method=getOrderType}")
----

And an example with contains, testing if the title contains the word
Camel

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.title} contains 'Camel'")
----

And an example with regex, testing if the number header is a 4 digit
value:

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.number} regex '\\d{4}'")
----

And finally an example if the header equals any of the values in the
list. Each element must be separated by comma, and no space around. +
 This also works for numbers etc, as Camel will convert each element
into the type of the left hand side.

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.type} in 'gold,silver'")
----

And for all the last 3 we also support the negate test using not:

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.type} not in 'gold,silver'")
----

And you can test if the type is a certain instance, eg for instance a
String

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.type} is 'java.lang.String'")
----

We have added a shorthand for all `java.lang` types so you can write it
as:

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.type} is 'String'")
----

Ranges are also supported. The range interval requires numbers and both
from and end are inclusive. For instance to test whether a value is
between 100 and 199:

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.number} range 100..199")
----

Notice we use `..` in the range without spaces. It is based on the same
syntax as Groovy.

From *Camel 2.9* onwards the range value must be in single quotes

[source,java]
----
simple("${in.header.number} range '100..199'")
----

==== Using Spring XML

As the Spring XML does not have all the power as the Java DSL with all
its various builder methods, you have to resort to use some other
languages for testing with simple operators. Now you can do this with the simple
language. In the sample below we want to test if the header is a widget
order:

[source,xml]
----
<from uri="seda:orders">
   <filter>
       <simple>${in.header.type} == 'widget'</simple>
       <to uri="bean:orderService?method=handleWidget"/>
   </filter>
</from>
----

=== Using and / or

If you have two expressions you can combine them with the `and` or `or`
operator.

TIP: *Camel 2.9 onwards* Use && or || from Camel 2.9 onwards.

For instance:

[source,java]
-----
simple("${in.header.title} contains 'Camel' and ${in.header.type'} == 'gold'")
-----

And of course the `or` is also supported. The sample would be:

[source,java]
-----
simple("${in.header.title} contains 'Camel' or ${in.header.type'} == 'gold'")
-----

*Notice:* Currently `and` or `or` can only be used *once* in a simple
language expression. This might change in the future. +
 So you *cannot* do:

[source,java]
-----
simple("${in.header.title} contains 'Camel' and ${in.header.type'} == 'gold' and ${in.header.number} range 100..200")
-----


=== Samples

In the Spring XML sample below we filter based on a header value:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------
<from uri="seda:orders">
   <filter>
       <simple>${in.header.foo}</simple>
       <to uri="mock:fooOrders"/>
   </filter>
</from>
--------------------------------------------

The Simple language can be used for the predicate test above in the
Message Filter pattern, where we test if the
in message has a `foo` header (a header with the key `foo` exists). If
the expression evaluates to *true* then the message is routed to the
`mock:fooOrders` endpoint, otherwise the message is dropped.

The same example in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:orders")
    .filter().simple("${in.header.foo}")
        .to("seda:fooOrders");
----

You can also use the simple language for simple text concatenations such
as:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:hello")
    .transform().simple("Hello ${in.header.user} how are you?")
    .to("mock:reply");
----

Notice that we must use $\{ } placeholders in the expression now to
allow Camel to parse it correctly.

And this sample uses the date command to output current date.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:hello")
    .transform().simple("The today is ${date:now:yyyyMMdd} and it is a great day.")
    .to("mock:reply");
----

And in the sample below we invoke the bean language to invoke a method
on a bean to be included in the returned string:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:order")
    .transform().simple("OrderId: ${bean:orderIdGenerator}")
    .to("mock:reply");
----

Where `orderIdGenerator` is the id of the bean registered in the
Registry. If using Spring then it is the Spring bean
id.

If we want to declare which method to invoke on the order id generator
bean we must prepend `.method name` such as below where we invoke the
`generateId` method.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:order")
    .transform().simple("OrderId: ${bean:orderIdGenerator.generateId}")
    .to("mock:reply");
----

We can use the `?method=methodname` option that we are familiar with the
<<bean-component,Bean>> component itself:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:order")
    .transform().simple("OrderId: ${bean:orderIdGenerator?method=generateId}")
    .to("mock:reply");
----

And from Camel 2.3 onwards you can also convert the body to a given
type, for example to ensure that it is a String you can do:

[source,xml]
----
<transform>
  <simple>Hello ${bodyAs(String)} how are you?</simple>
</transform>
----

There are a few types which have a shorthand notation, so we can use
`String` instead of `java.lang.String`. These are:
`byte[], String, Integer, Long`. All other types must use their FQN
name, e.g. `org.w3c.dom.Document`.

It is also possible to lookup a value from a header `Map` in *Camel 2.3*
onwards:

[source,xml]
----
<transform>
  <simple>The gold value is ${header.type[gold]}</simple>
</transform>
----

In the code above we lookup the header with name `type` and regard it as
a `java.util.Map` and we then lookup with the key `gold` and return the
value. If the header is not convertible to Map an exception is thrown. If the
header with name `type` does not exist `null` is returned.

From Camel 2.9 onwards you can nest functions, such as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<setHeader headerName="myHeader">
  <simple>${properties:${header.someKey}}</simple>
</setHeader>

=== Referring to constants or enums

*Available as of Camel 2.11*

Suppose you have an enum for customers

And in a Content Based Router we can use
the <<simple-language,Simple>> language to refer to this enum, to check
the message which enum it matches.

=== Using new lines or tabs in XML DSLs

*Available as of Camel 2.9.3*

From Camel 2.9.3 onwards it is easier to specify new lines or tabs in
XML DSLs as you can escape the value now

[source,xml]
----
<transform>
  <simple>The following text\nis on a new line</simple>
</transform>
----

=== Leading and trailing whitespace handling

*Available as of Camel 2.10.0*

From Camel 2.10.0 onwards, the trim attribute of the expression can be
used to control whether the leading and trailing whitespace characters
are removed or preserved. The default value is true, which removes the
whitespace characters.

[source,xml]
----
<setBody>
  <simple trim="false">You get some trailing whitespace characters.     </simple>
</setBody>
----

=== Setting result type

*Available as of Camel 2.8*

You can now provide a result type to the <<simple-language,Simple>>
expression, which means the result of the evaluation will be converted
to the desired type. This is most useable to define types such as
booleans, integers, etc.

For example to set a header as a boolean type you can do:

[source,java]
----
.setHeader("cool", simple("true", Boolean.class))
----

And in XML DSL

[source,xml]
----
<setHeader headerName="cool">
  <!-- use resultType to indicate that the type should be a java.lang.Boolean -->
  <simple resultType="java.lang.Boolean">true</simple>
</setHeader>
----

=== Changing function start and end tokens

*Available as of Camel 2.9.1*

You can configure the function start and end tokens - $\{ } using the
setters `changeFunctionStartToken` and `changeFunctionEndToken` on
`SimpleLanguage`, using Java code. From Spring XML you can define a
<bean> tag with the new changed tokens in the properties as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- configure Simple to use custom prefix/suffix tokens -->
<bean id="simple" class="org.apache.camel.language.simple.SimpleLanguage">
  <property name="functionStartToken" value="["/>
  <property name="functionEndToken" value="]"/>
</bean>
----

In the example above we use [ ] as the changed tokens.

Notice by changing the start/end token you change those in all the Camel
applications which share the same *camel-core* on their classpath. +
 For example in an OSGi server this may affect many applications, where
as a Web Application as a WAR file it only affects the Web Application.

=== Loading script from external resource

*Available as of Camel 2.11*

You can externalize the script and have Camel load it from a resource
such as `"classpath:"`, `"file:"`, or `"http:"`. +
 This is done using the following syntax: `"resource:scheme:location"`,
eg to refer to a file on the classpath you can do:

[source,java]
----
.setHeader("myHeader").simple("resource:classpath:mysimple.txt")
----

=== Setting Spring beans to Exchange properties

*Available as of Camel 2.6*

You can set a spring bean into an exchange property as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myBeanId" class="my.package.MyCustomClass" />
...
<route>
  ...
  <setProperty propertyName="monitoring.message">
    <simple>ref:myBeanId</simple>
  </setProperty>
  ...
</route>
----

=== Dependencies

The <<simple-language,Simple>> language is part of *camel-core*.
