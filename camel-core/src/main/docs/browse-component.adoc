== Browse Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.3*

The Browse component provides a simple
BrowsableEndpoint which can be useful for
testing, visualisation tools or debugging. The exchanges sent to the
endpoint are all available to be browsed.

=== URI format

[source]
-------------------------
browse:someName[?options]
-------------------------

Where *someName* can be any string to uniquely identify the endpoint.


=== Options


// component options: START
The Browse component has no options.
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Browse endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
browse:name
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *name* | *Required* A name which can be any string to uniquely identify the endpoint |  | String
|===


==== Query Parameters (4 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the default exchange pattern when creating an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


=== Sample

In the route below, we insert a `browse:` component to be able to browse
the Exchanges that are passing through:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:order.in").to("browse:orderReceived").to("bean:processOrder");
----

We can now inspect the received exchanges from within the Java code:

[source,java]
----
private CamelContext context;

public void inspectRecievedOrders() {
    BrowsableEndpoint browse = context.getEndpoint("browse:orderReceived", BrowsableEndpoint.class);
    List<Exchange> exchanges = browse.getExchanges();

    // then we can inspect the list of received exchanges from Java
    for (Exchange exchange : exchanges) {
        String payload = exchange.getIn().getBody();
        // do something with payload
    }
}
----
