Publish Subscribe Channel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PublishSubscribeChannel.html[Publish
Subscribe Channel] from the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns] using for
example the following components:

* link:jms.html[JMS] for working with JMS Topics for high performance,
clustering and load balancing
* link:xmpp.html[XMPP] when using rooms for group communication
* link:seda.html[SEDA] for working with SEDA in the same
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] which can work in pub-sub, but
allowing multiple consumers.
* link:vm.html[VM] as SEDA but for intra-JVM.

[[PublishSubscribeChannel-UsingRoutingLogic]]
Using Routing Logic
+++++++++++++++++++

Another option is to explicitly list the publish-subscribe relationship
in your routing logic; this keeps the producer and consumer decoupled
but lets you control the fine grained routing configuration using the
link:dsl.html[DSL] or link:xml-configuration.html[Xml Configuration].

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
        errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error"));
 
        from("direct:a")
            .multicast().to("direct:b", "direct:c", "direct:d");
    }
};
---------------------------------------------------

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------
<camelContext errorHandlerRef="errorHandler" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:a"/>
        <multicast>
            <to uri="direct:b"/>
            <to uri="direct:c"/>
            <to uri="direct:d"/>
        </multicast>
    </route>
</camelContext>

[[PublishSubscribeChannel-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
