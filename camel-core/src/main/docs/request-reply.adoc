[[RequestReply-RequestReply]]
== Request Reply

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/RequestReply.html[Request
Reply] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns]
by supporting the link:exchange-pattern.html[Exchange Pattern] on a
link:message.html[Message] which can be set to *InOut* to indicate a
request/reply. Camel link:components.html[Components] then implement
this pattern using the underlying transport or protocols.

For example when using link:jms.html[JMS] with InOut the component will
by default perform these actions

* create by default a temporary inbound queue
* set the JMSReplyTo destination on the request message
* set the JMSCorrelationID on the request message
* send the request message
* consume the response and associate the inbound message to the request
using the JMSCorrelationID (as you may be performing many concurrent
request/responses).

TIP: *Related* See the related link:event-message.html[Event Message] message

[[RequestReply-ExplicitlyspecifyingInOut]]
=== Explicitly specifying InOut

When consuming messages from link:jms.html[JMS] a Request-Reply is
indicated by the presence of the *JMSReplyTo* header.

You can explicitly force an endpoint to be in Request Reply mode by
setting the exchange pattern on the URI. e.g.

[source]
----
jms:MyQueue?exchangePattern=InOut
----

You can specify the exchange pattern in DSL rule or Spring
configuration.
