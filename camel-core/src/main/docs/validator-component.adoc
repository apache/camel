## Validator Component

The Validation component performs XML validation of the message body
using the JAXP Validation API and based on any of the supported XML
schema languages, which defaults to http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema[XML
Schema]

Note that the link:jing.html[Jing] component also supports the following
useful schema languages:

* http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html[RelaxNG Compact
Syntax]
* http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax]

The link:msv.html[MSV] component also supports
http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax].

### URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------------------
validator:someLocalOrRemoteResource
-----------------------------------

Where *someLocalOrRemoteResource* is some URL to a local resource on the
classpath or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file
system which contains the XSD to validate against. For example:

* `msv:org/foo/bar.xsd`
* `msv:file:../foo/bar.xsd`
* `msv:http://acme.com/cheese.xsd`
* `validator:com/mypackage/myschema.xsd`

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component when using *Camel 2.8* or older:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

From Camel 2.9 onwards the link:validation.html[Validation] component is
provided directly in the camel-core.

### Options

// component options: START
The Validator component supports 1 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| resourceResolverFactory | advanced |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Validator component supports 12 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| resourceUri | producer |  | String | *Required* URL to a local resource on the classpathor a reference to lookup a bean in the Registry or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file system which contains the XSD to validate against.
| failOnNullBody | producer | true | boolean | Whether to fail if no body exists.
| failOnNullHeader | producer | true | boolean | Whether to fail if no header exists when validating against a header.
| headerName | producer |  | String | To validate against a header instead of the message body.
| errorHandler | advanced |  | ValidatorErrorHandler | To use a custom org.apache.camel.processor.validation.ValidatorErrorHandler. The default error handler captures the errors and throws an exception.
| resourceResolver | advanced |  | LSResourceResolver | To use a custom LSResourceResolver. See also link setResourceResolverFactory(ValidatorResourceResolverFactory)
| resourceResolverFactory | advanced |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory | For creating a resource resolver which depends on the endpoint resource URI. Must not be used in combination with method link setResourceResolver(LSResourceResolver). If not set then DefaultValidatorResourceResolverFactory is used
| schemaFactory | advanced |  | SchemaFactory | To use a custom javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory
| schemaLanguage | advanced | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema | String | Configures the W3C XML Schema Namespace URI.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
| useDom | advanced | false | boolean | Whether DOMSource/DOMResult or SaxSource/SaxResult should be used by the validator.
| useSharedSchema | advanced | true | boolean | Whether the Schema instance should be shared or not. This option is introduced to work around a JDK 1.6.x bug. Xerces should not have this issue.

### Example

The following
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/validator/camelContext.xml[example]
shows how to configure a route from endpoint *direct:start* which then
goes to one of two endpoints, either *mock:valid* or *mock:invalid*
based on whether or not the XML matches the given schema (which is
supplied on the classpath).

### Advanced: JMX method clearCachedSchema

Since *Camel 2.17*, you can force that the cached schema in the
validator endpoint is cleared and reread with the next process call with
the JMX operationÂ `clearCachedSchema. `You can also use this method to
programmatically clear the cache. This method is available on the
`ValidatorEndpoint `class`.`
