## Validator Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.1*

The Validation component performs XML validation of the message body
using the JAXP Validation API and based on any of the supported XML
schema languages, which defaults to http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema[XML
Schema]

Note that the link:jing.html[Jing] component also supports the following
useful schema languages:

* http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html[RelaxNG Compact
Syntax]
* http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax]

The link:msv.html[MSV] component also supports
http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax].

### URI format

[source,java]
-----------------------------------
validator:someLocalOrRemoteResource
-----------------------------------

Where *someLocalOrRemoteResource* is some URL to a local resource on the
classpath or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file
system which contains the XSD to validate against. For example:

* `msv:org/foo/bar.xsd`
* `msv:file:../foo/bar.xsd`
* `msv:http://acme.com/cheese.xsd`
* `validator:com/mypackage/myschema.xsd`

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component when using *Camel 2.8* or older:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

From Camel 2.9 onwards the link:validation.html[Validation] component is
provided directly in the camel-core.

### Options

// component options: START
The Validator component supports 1 options which are listed below.



{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| resourceResolverFactory | advanced |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Validator component supports 12 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| resourceUri | producer |  | String | *Required* URL to a local resource on the classpathor a reference to lookup a bean in the Registry or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file system which contains the XSD to validate against.
| failOnNullBody | producer | true | boolean | Whether to fail if no body exists.
| failOnNullHeader | producer | true | boolean | Whether to fail if no header exists when validating against a header.
| headerName | producer |  | String | To validate against a header instead of the message body.
| errorHandler | advanced |  | ValidatorErrorHandler | To use a custom org.apache.camel.processor.validation.ValidatorErrorHandler. The default error handler captures the errors and throws an exception.
| resourceResolver | advanced |  | LSResourceResolver | To use a custom LSResourceResolver. See also link setResourceResolverFactory(ValidatorResourceResolverFactory)
| resourceResolverFactory | advanced |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory | For creating a resource resolver which depends on the endpoint resource URI. Must not be used in combination with method link setResourceResolver(LSResourceResolver). If not set then DefaultValidatorResourceResolverFactory is used
| schemaFactory | advanced |  | SchemaFactory | To use a custom javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory
| schemaLanguage | advanced | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema | String | Configures the W3C XML Schema Namespace URI.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
| useDom | advanced | false | boolean | Whether DOMSource/DOMResult or SaxSource/SaxResult should be used by the validator.
| useSharedSchema | advanced | true | boolean | Whether the Schema instance should be shared or not. This option is introduced to work around a JDK 1.6.x bug. Xerces should not have this issue.

### Example

The following
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/validator/camelContext.xml[example]
shows how to configure a route from endpoint *direct:start* which then
goes to one of two endpoints, either *mock:valid* or *mock:invalid*
based on whether or not the XML matches the given schema (which is
supplied on the classpath).

### Advanced: JMX method clearCachedSchema

Since *Camel 2.17*, you can force that the cached schema in the
validator endpoint is cleared and reread with the next process call with
the JMX operation `clearCachedSchema. `You can also use this method to
programmatically clear the cache. This method is available on the
`ValidatorEndpoint `class`.`
