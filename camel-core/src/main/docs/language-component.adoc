## Language Component

*Available as of Camel 2.5*

The language component allows you to send link:exchange.html[Exchange]
to an endpoint which executes a script by any of the supported
link:languages.html[Languages] in Camel. +
 By having a component to execute language scripts, it allows more
dynamic routing capabilities. For example by using the
link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] or link:dynamic-router.html[Dynamic
Router] EIPs you can send messages to `language` endpoints where the
script is dynamic defined as well.

This component is provided out of the box in `camel-core` and hence no
additional JARs is needed. You only have to include additional Camel
components if the language of choice mandates it, such as using
link:groovy.html[Groovy] or link:javascript.html[JavaScript] languages.

### URI format

[source,java]
------------------------------------------
language://languageName[:script][?options]
------------------------------------------

And from Camel 2.11 onwards you can refer to an external resource for
the script using same notation as supported by the other
link:language.html[Language]s in Camel

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
language://languageName:resource:scheme:location][?options]
-----------------------------------------------------------

### URI Options


// component options: START
The Language component has no options.
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Language component supports 8 endpoint options which are listed below:

{% raw %}
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1m,1m,5",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description
| languageName | producer |  | String | *Required* Sets the name of the language to use
| resourceUri | producer |  | String | Path to the resource or a reference to lookup a bean in the Registry to use as the resource
| binary | producer | false | boolean | Whether the script is binary content or text content. By default the script is read as text content (eg java.lang.String)
| cacheScript | producer | false | boolean | Whether to cache the compiled script and reuse Notice reusing the script can cause side effects from processing one Camel org.apache.camel.Exchange to the next org.apache.camel.Exchange.
| contentCache | producer | false | boolean | Sets whether to use resource content cache or not.
| script | producer |  | String | Sets the script to execute
| transform | producer | true | boolean | Whether or not the result of the script should be used as message body. This options is default true.
| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported).
|=======================================================================
{% endraw %}
// endpoint options: END


### Message Headers

The following message headers can be used to affect the behavior of the
component

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Description

|`CamelLanguageScript` |The script to execute provided in the header. Takes precedence over
script configured on the endpoint.
|=======================================================================

### Examples

For example you can use the link:simple.html[Simple] language to
link:message-translator.html[Message Translator] a message:

In case you want to convert the message body type you can do this as
well:

You can also use the link:groovy.html[Groovy] language, such as this
example where the input message will by multiplied with 2:

You can also provide the script as a header as shown below. Here we use
link:xpath.html[XPath] language to extract the text from the `<foo>`
tag.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object out = producer.requestBodyAndHeader("language:xpath", "<foo>Hello World</foo>", Exchange.LANGUAGE_SCRIPT, "/foo/text()");
assertEquals("Hello World", out);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Loading scripts from resources

*Available as of Camel 2.9*

You can specify a resource uri for a script to load in either the
endpoint uri, or in the `Exchange.LANGUAGE_SCRIPT` header. +
 The uri must start with one of the following schemes: file:,
classpath:, or http:

For example to load a script from the classpath:

By default the script is loaded once and cached. However you can disable
the `contentCache` option and have the script loaded on each
evaluation. +
 For example if the file myscript.txt is changed on disk, then the
updated script is used:

From *Camel 2.11* onwards you can refer to the resource similar to the
other link:language.html[Language]s in Camel by prefixing with
`"resource:"` as shown below:
