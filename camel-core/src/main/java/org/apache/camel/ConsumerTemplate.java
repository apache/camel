/**
 * Template for working with Camel and consuming {@link Message} instances in an
 * {@link Exchange} from an {@link Endpoint}.
 * <br/>
 * <p/>This template is an implementation of the
 * <a href="http://camel.apache.org/polling-consumer.html">Polling Consumer EIP</a>.
 * This is <b>not</b> the <a href="http://camel.apache.org/event-driven-consumer.html">Event Driven Consumer EIP</a>.
 * <br/>
 * <p/>The {@link ConsumerTemplate} is <b>thread safe</b>.
 * <br/>
 * <p/><b>All</b> methods throws {@link RuntimeCamelException} if consuming of
 * the {@link Exchange} failed and an Exception occurred. The <tt>getCause</tt>
 * method on {@link RuntimeCamelException} returns the wrapper original caused
 * exception.
 * <br/>
 * <p/>All the receive<b>Body</b> methods will return the content according to this strategy
 * <ul>
 *   <li>throws {@link RuntimeCamelException} as stated above</li>
 *   <li>The <tt>fault.body</tt> if there is a fault message set and its not <tt>null</tt></li>
 *   <li>The <tt>out.body</tt> if there is a out message set and its not <tt>null</tt></li>
 *   <li>The <tt>in.body</tt></li>
 * </ul>
 * <br/>
 * <p/>Before using the template it must be started.
 * And when you are done using the template, make sure to {@link #stop()} the template.
 * <br/>
 * <p/><b>Important note on usage:</b> See this
 * <a href="http://camel.apache.org/why-does-camel-use-too-many-threads-with-producertemplate.html">FAQ entry</a>
 * before using, it applies to this {@link ConsumerTemplate} as well.
