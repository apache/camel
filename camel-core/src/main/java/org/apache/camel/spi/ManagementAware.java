/**
 * An interface to represent an object being managed.
 * <p/>
 * This allows you to gain fine grained control of managing objects with Camel.
 * For example various Camel components will implement this interface to provide
 * management to their endpoints and consumers.
 * <p/>
 * A popular choice is to use Spring JMX annotations to decorate your object to pinpoint
 * the JMX attributes and operations. If you do this then you do <b>not</b> need to use
 * this interface. This interface is only if you need to be in full control of the MBean
 * and therefore can return a {@link javax.management.MBeanInfo} object.
 *
 * @deprecated will be removed in Camel 3.0. Instead use Spring JMX annotations,
 *             see this <a href="http://camel.apache.org/why-is-my-processor-not-showing-up-in-jconsole.html">FAQ entry</a>
