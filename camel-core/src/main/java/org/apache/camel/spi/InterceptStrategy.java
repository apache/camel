/**
 * The purpose of this interface is to allow an implementation to wrap
 * processors in a route with interceptors.  For example, a possible
 * usecase is to gather performance statistics at the processor's level.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Important: </b> This SPI is not intended to be used by Camel end users - do NOT use this.
 * <p/>
 * Its <b>strongly</b> adviced to use an {@link org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor} as the returned wrapped
 * {@link Processor} which ensures the interceptor works well with the asynchronous routing engine.
 * You can use the {@link org.apache.camel.processor.DelegateAsyncProcessor} to easily return an
 * {@link org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor} and override the
 * {@link org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor#process(org.apache.camel.Exchange, org.apache.camel.AsyncCallback)} to
 * implement your interceptor logic. And just invoke the super method to <b>continue</b> routing.
