 * Its <b>strongly</b> advised to use an {@link org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor} as the returned wrapped
 * {@link Processor} which ensures the policy works well with the asynchronous routing engine.
 * You can use the {@link org.apache.camel.processor.DelegateAsyncProcessor} to easily return an
 * {@link org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor} and override the
 * {@link org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor#process(org.apache.camel.Exchange, org.apache.camel.AsyncCallback)} to
 * implement your interceptor logic. And just invoke the super method to <b>continue</b> routing.
 * <p/>
 * Mind that not all frameworks supports asynchronous routing, for example some transaction managers, such as
 * Spring Transaction uses the current thread to store state of the transaction, and thus can't transfer this
 * state to other threads when routing continues asynchronously.
