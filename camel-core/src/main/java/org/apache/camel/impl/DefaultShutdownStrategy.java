/**
 * Default {@link org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy} which uses graceful shutdown.
 * <p/>
 * Graceful shutdown ensures that any inflight and pending messages will be taken into account
 * and it will wait until these exchanges has been completed.
 * <p/>
 * This strategy will perform graceful shutdown in two steps:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Graceful - By suspending/stopping consumers, and let any in-flight exchanges complete</li>
 *     <li>Forced - After a given period of time, a timeout occurred and if there are still pending
 *     exchanges to complete, then a more aggressive forced strategy is performed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The idea by the <tt>graceful</tt> shutdown strategy, is to stop taking in more new messages,
 * and allow any existing inflight messages to complete. Then when there is no more inflight messages
 * then the routes can be fully shutdown. This mean that if there is inflight messages then we will have
 * to wait for these messages to complete. If they do not complete after a period of time, then a
 * timeout triggers. And then a more aggressive strategy takes over.
 * <p/>
 * The idea by the <tt>forced</tt> shutdown strategy, is to stop continue processing messages.
 * And force routes and its services to shutdown now. There is a risk when shutting down now,
 * that some resources is not properly shutdown, which can cause side effects. The timeout value
 * is by default 300 seconds, but can be customized.
 * <p/>
 * As this strategy will politely wait until all exchanges has been completed it can potential wait
 * for a long time, and hence why a timeout value can be set. When the timeout triggers you can also
 * specify whether the remainder consumers should be shutdown now or ignore.
 * <p/>
 * Will by default use a timeout of 300 seconds (5 minutes) by which it will shutdown now the remaining consumers.
 * This ensures that when shutting down Camel it at some point eventually will shutdown.
 * This behavior can of course be configured using the {@link #setTimeout(long)} and
 * {@link #setShutdownNowOnTimeout(boolean)} methods.
 * <p/>
 * Routes will by default be shutdown in the reverse order of which they where started.
 * You can customize this using the {@link #setShutdownRoutesInReverseOrder(boolean)} method.
 * <p/>
 * After route consumers have been shutdown, then any {@link ShutdownPrepared} services on the routes
 * is being prepared for shutdown, by invoking {@link ShutdownPrepared#prepareShutdown(boolean,boolean)} which
 * <tt>force=false</tt>.
 * <p/>
 * Then if a timeout occurred and the strategy has been configured with shutdown-now on timeout, then
 * the strategy performs a more aggressive forced shutdown, by forcing all consumers to shutdown
 * and then invokes {@link ShutdownPrepared#prepareShutdown(boolean,boolean)} with <tt>force=true</tt>
 * on the services. This allows the services to know they should force shutdown now.
 * <p/>
 * When timeout occurred and a forced shutdown is happening, then there may be threads/tasks which are
 * still inflight which may be rejected continued being routed. By default this can cause WARN and ERRORs
 * to be logged. The option {@link #setSuppressLoggingOnTimeout(boolean)} can be used to suppress these
 * logs, so they are logged at TRACE level instead.
 * <p/>
 * Also when a timeout occurred then information about the inflight exchanges is logged, if {@link #isLogInflightExchangesOnTimeout()}
 * is enabled (is by default). This allows end users to known where these inflight exchanges currently are in the route(s),
 * and how long time they have been inflight.
 * <p/>
 * This information can also be obtained from the {@link org.apache.camel.spi.InflightRepository}
 * at all time during runtime.
