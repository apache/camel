 * The <code>BundleTrackerCustomizer</code> interface allows a
 * <code>BundleTracker</code> to customize the <code>Bundle</code>s that are
 * tracked. A <code>BundleTrackerCustomizer</code> is called when a bundle is
 * being added to a <code>BundleTracker</code>. The
 * <code>BundleTrackerCustomizer</code> can then return an object for the
 * tracked bundle. A <code>BundleTrackerCustomizer</code> is also called when a
 * tracked bundle is modified or has been removed from a
 * <code>BundleTracker</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The methods in this interface may be called as the result of a
 * <code>BundleEvent</code> being received by a <code>BundleTracker</code>.
 * Since <code>BundleEvent</code>s are received synchronously by the
 * <code>BundleTracker</code>, it is highly recommended that implementations of
 * these methods do not alter bundle states while being synchronized on any
 * object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>BundleTracker</code> class is thread-safe. It does not call a
 * <code>BundleTrackerCustomizer</code> while holding any locks.
 * <code>BundleTrackerCustomizer</code> implementations must also be
 * thread-safe.
