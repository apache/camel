/**
 * Threads processor that leverage a thread pool for continue processing the {@link Exchange}s
 * using the asynchronous routing engine.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Notice:</b> For transacted routes then this {@link ThreadsProcessor} is not in use, as we want to
 * process messages using the same thread to support all work done in the same transaction. The reason
 * is that the transaction manager that orchestrate the transaction, requires all the work to be done
 * on the same thread.
 * <p/>
 * Pay attention to how this processor handles rejected tasks.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Abort - The current exchange will be set with a {@link RejectedExecutionException} exception,
 * and marked to stop continue routing.
 * The {@link org.apache.camel.spi.UnitOfWork} will be regarded as <b>failed</b>, due the exception.</li>
 * <li>Discard - The current exchange will be marked to stop continue routing (notice no exception is set).
 * The {@link org.apache.camel.spi.UnitOfWork} will be regarded as <b>successful</b>, due no exception being set.</li>
 * <li>DiscardOldest - The oldest exchange will be marked to stop continue routing (notice no exception is set).
 * The {@link org.apache.camel.spi.UnitOfWork} will be regarded as <b>successful</b>, due no exception being set.
 * And the current exchange will be added to the task queue.</li>
 * <li>CallerRuns - The current exchange will be processed by the current thread. Which mean the current thread
 * will not be free to process a new exchange, as its processing the current exchange.</li>
 * </ul>
