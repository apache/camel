/**
 * Resequences elements based on a given {@link SequenceElementComparator}.
 * This resequencer is designed for resequencing element streams. Stream-based
 * resequencing has the advantage that the number of elements to be resequenced
 * need not be known in advance. Resequenced elements are delivered via a
 * {@link SequenceSender}.
 * <p>
 * The resequencer's behaviour for a given comparator is controlled by the
 * <code>timeout</code> property. This is the timeout (in milliseconds) for a
 * given element managed by this resequencer. An out-of-sequence element can
 * only be marked as <i>ready-for-delivery</i> if it either times out or if it
 * has an immediate predecessor (in that case it is in-sequence). If an
 * immediate predecessor of a waiting element arrives the timeout task for the
 * waiting element will be cancelled (which marks it as <i>ready-for-delivery</i>).
 * <p>
 * If the maximum out-of-sequence time difference between elements within a
 * stream is known, the <code>timeout</code> value should be set to this
 * value. In this case it is guaranteed that all elements of a stream will be
 * delivered in sequence via the {@link SequenceSender}. The lower the
 * <code>timeout</code> value is compared to the out-of-sequence time
 * difference between elements within a stream the higher the probability is for
 * out-of-sequence elements delivered by this resequencer. Delivery of elements
 * must be explicitly triggered by applications using the {@link #deliver()} or
 * {@link #deliverNext()} methods. Only elements that are <i>ready-for-delivery</i>
 * are delivered by these methods. The longer an application waits to trigger a
 * delivery the more elements may become <i>ready-for-delivery</i>.
 * <p>
 * The resequencer remembers the last-delivered element. If an element arrives
 * which is the immediate successor of the last-delivered element it is
 * <i>ready-for-delivery</i> immediately. After delivery the last-delivered
 * element is adjusted accordingly. If the last-delivered element is
 * <code>null</code> i.e. the resequencer was newly created the first arriving
 * element needs <code>timeout</code> milliseconds in any case for becoming
 * <i>ready-for-delivery</i>.
 * <p>
