# keep at least one package in camel-core so the annotation type converter
# should at least be able to discover one package to scan notice that there
# are no @Converter classes in org.apache.camel.core. As all camel-core
# type converters have been pre-loaded without package scanning, as that is
# faster. 
# If you adding a new converter class in camel-core, please added the class
# into CorePackageScanClassResolver
