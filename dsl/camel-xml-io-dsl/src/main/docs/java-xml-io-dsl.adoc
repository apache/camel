*Since Camel {since}*

The `xml-io-dsl` is the Camel optimized XML DSL with a very fast and low overhead XML parser.
The classic XML DSL was loaded via JAXB that is heavy and overhead.

The JAXB parser is generic and can be used for parsing any XML.
However, the `xml-io-dsl` is a source code generated parser that is Camel specific and can only parse Camel `.xml`
route files (not classic Spring `<beans>` XML files).

If you are using Camel XML DSL then its recommended using `xml-io-dsl` instead of `xml-jaxb-dsl`.
You can use this in all of Camel's runtime such as Spring Boot, Quarkus, Camel Main, and Camel K etc.

== Example

The following `my-route.xml` source file:

.my-route.xml
[source,xml]
----
<routes xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="timer:tick"/>
        <setBody>
            <constant>Hello Camel K!</constant>
         </setBody>
        <to uri="log:info"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

TIP: You can omit the `xmlns` namespace. And if there is only a single route, you can use `<route>` as the root XML tag.

Can then be loaded and run with Camel CLI or Camel K.

.Running with Camel K

[source,bash]
----
kamel run my-route.xml
----

.Running with Camel CLI

[source,bash]
----
camel run my-route.xml
----

*Since Camel 4.0.0*

It is now possible with `xml-io-dsl` to declare some beans to be bound to xref:manual::registry.adoc[Camel Registry] in similar way as with xref:yaml-dsl.adoc[YAML DSL]. Beans may be declared in XML and have their properties (also nested) defined. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

	<bean name="beanFromProps" type="com.acme.MyBean">
		<properties>
			<property key="field1" value="f1_p" />
			<property key="field2" value="f2_p" />
			<property key="nested.field1" value="nf1_p" />
			<property key="nested.field2" value="nf2_p" />
		</properties>
	</bean>

</camel>
----

While keeping all the benefits of fast XML parser used by `xml-io-dsl`, Camel can also process XML elements declared in other XML namespaces and process them separately. With this mechanism it is possible to include XML elements using Spring's `http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans` namespace.

This brings the flexibility of Spring Beans into xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main] without actually running any Spring Application Context (or Spring Boot). When elements from Spring namespace are found, they are used to populate and configure an instance of `org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory` and leverage Spring dependency injection to wire the beans together. These beans are then exposed through normal xref:manual::registry.adoc[Camel Registry] and may be used by Camel routes.

Here's an example `camel.xml` file, which defines both the routes and beans used (referred to) by the route definition:

.camel.xml
[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
        <bean id="messageString" class="java.lang.String">
            <constructor-arg index="0" value="Hello"/>
        </bean>

        <bean id="greeter" class="org.apache.camel.main.app.Greeter">
            <description>Spring Bean</description>
            <property name="message">
                <bean class="org.apache.camel.main.app.GreeterMessage">
                    <property name="msg" ref="messageString"/>
                </bean>
            </property>
        </bean>
    </beans>

    <route id="my-route">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <bean ref="greeter"/>
        <to uri="mock:finish"/>
    </route>

</camel>
----

A `my-route` route is referring to `greeter` bean which is defined using Spring `<bean>` element.
