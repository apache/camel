*Since Camel {since}*

The camel-cli-debug enables Camel debugger for Camel CLI (camel-jbang).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The camel-cli-debug is only for development purposes, it should **not** be used for production.

Do not use both `camel-debug` and `camel-cli-debug` JARs in the Camel application classpath. Use only `camel-cli-debug` JAR.
====

== Auto-detection from classpath

To use this implementation all you need to do is to add the `camel-cli-debug` dependency to the classpath,
and Camel should auto-detect this on startup and log as follows:

[source,text]
----
Detected: camel-cli-debug JAR (Enabling Camel Debugging)
----

== Debugging

Add `camel-cli-debug` JAR to the classpath of your application, and then run this application. For example with Spring Boot using `mvn spring-boot:run`.

Then the application starts and Camel detects the CLI debugger that then logs a message, waiting for the CLI to remotely attach.

From a CLI terminal then you can execute:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel debug --remote-attach --name=<pid>
----

Where `<pid>` is the process id of the running Camel integration. You can see this from the log such as:

[source,text]
----
2025-12-04T15:48:12.542+01:00  INFO 6667 --- [           main] o.a.c.impl.engine.AbstractCamelContext   : Detected: camel-cli-debug JAR (Enabling Camel Debugging)
2025-12-04T15:48:12.543+01:00  INFO 6667 --- [           main] o.a.c.c.c.debug.CamelCliDebuggerFactory  : ================================================================================
2025-12-04T15:48:12.543+01:00  INFO 6667 --- [           main] o.a.c.c.c.debug.CamelCliDebuggerFactory  : Waiting for CLI to remote attach (camel debug --remote-attach --name=6667)
----

To connect the CLI to the Camel application that will then continue to start and perform debugging from the CLI terminal.
