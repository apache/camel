IMPORTANT: This DSL is experimental support level and is not recommended being used for production

The `js-dsl` is used for runtime compiling JavaScript routes in an existing running Camel integration.
This was invented for Camel K and later ported to Apache Camel.

This means that Camel will load the `.js` source during startup and via the JavaScript compiler transform
this into Camel routes.


== Example

The following `hello.js` source file:

.hello.js
[source,javascript]
----
function proc(e) {
    e.getIn().setBody('Hello Camel K!')
}

from('timer:tick')
    .process(proc)
    .to('log:info')
----

Can then be loaded and run with Camel CLI or Camel K.

.Running with Camel K

[source,bash]
----
kamel run hello.js
----

.Running with Camel CLI

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.js
----
