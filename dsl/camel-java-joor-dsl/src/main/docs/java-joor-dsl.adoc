*Since Camel {since}*

The `java-joor-dsl` is used for runtime compiling Java routes in an existing running Camel integration.
This was invented for Camel K and later ported to Apache Camel.

This means that Camel will load the `.java` source during startup and compile this to Java byte code as `.class`,
which then are loaded via class loader and behaves as regular Java compiled routes.

== Example

The following `MyRoute.java` source file:

.MyRoute.java
[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class MyRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("timer:tick")
            .setBody()
                .constant("Hello Camel K!")
            .to("log:info");
    }
}
----

Can then be loaded and run with Camel CLI or Camel K.

.Running with Camel K

[source,bash]
----
kamel run MyRoute.java
----

.Running with Camel CLI

[source,bash]
----
camel run MyRoute.java
----
