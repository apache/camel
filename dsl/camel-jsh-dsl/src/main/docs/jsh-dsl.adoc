IMPORTANT: This DSL is experimental support level and is not recommended being used for production

The `jsh-dsl` is used for runtime compiling JavaShell routes in an existing running Camel integration.
This was invented for Camel K and later ported to Apache Camel.

This means that Camel will load the `.jsh` source during startup and use the JavaShell compiler to transform
this into Camel routes.

== Example

The following `example.js` source file:

.example.jsh
[source,java]
----
builder.from("timer:tick")
    .setBody()
        .constant("Hello Camel K!")
    .to("log:info");
----

Can then be loaded and run with Camel CLI or Camel K.

.Running with Camel K

[source,bash]
----
kamel run example.jsh
----

.Running with Camel CLI

[source,bash]
----
camel run example.jsh
----
