[Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) is an Open Source integration framework that empowers you to quickly and easily integrate various systems consuming or producing data.

### Introduction

Camel empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of domain-specific languages (DSL, such as Java, XML, Groovy, Kotlin, and YAML). This means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE, whether in a Java or XML editor.

Apache Camel uses URIs to enable easier integration with all kinds of
transport or messaging model including HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA
or CXF together with working with pluggable Data Format options.
Apache Camel is a small library that has minimal dependencies for easy embedding
in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same API regardless of the 
transport type, making it possible to interact with all the components provided out-of-the-box, 
with a good understanding of the API.

Apache Camel has powerful Bean Binding and integrated seamlessly with
popular frameworks such as Spring, Quarkus, and CDI.

Apache Camel has extensive testing support allowing you to easily
unit test your routes.
