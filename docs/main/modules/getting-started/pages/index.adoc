= Getting Started

This document will guide you through the fundamentals of the Apache Camel Core. At the end of it you will have a basic understanding of integrating systems, have learned some of the most important concepts of the project, and will be able to create and run your first project.

[[BookGettingStarted-eip-book]]

[[BookGettingStarted-TheEnterpriseIntegrationPatternsEIPBook]]
== The _Enterprise Integration Patterns_ (E.I.P.) book

Books about design patterns document the existing best practices within a particular field. The authors of these books hope to spread knowledge of best practices and to promote a vocabulary for discussing architectural designs.

A famous book about design patterns is the http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Deploying/dp/0321200683[_Enterprise
Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging
Solutions_] written by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Wolf. The E.I.P. book, as it is known, describes 65 design patterns for asynchronous messaging systems. The book gives each of them a name and an image - intended to be used in architectural diagrams.

[[BookGettingStarted-TheCamelProject]]
== The Apache Camel Core project

The http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel Core] is an open-source, Java-based project that helps users to implement many of the design patterns described in the E.I.P. book. As such, we suggest that our users have a copy of the E.I.P. book as one of their references.

[[BookGettingStarted-OnlineDocumentationForCamel]]
== Online documentation for Camel

The links on the right-side allow easy navigation between different topics within a guide. Our documentation tries to cover the topics for both novice and experienced users. However, experienced users may want to skip the subjects they are familiar with.

[[BookGettingStarted-SupportingDocumentation]]

Over the years, our community has written link:/community/books/[books], link:/community/articles/[articles] and tutorials about Apache Camel. Our community has presented Apache Camel in many videos and talks.

Some notable references from material developed from members, which may provide significant help for new users include:

* The https://www.manning.com/books/camel-in-action-second-edition[Camel in Action 2nd edition] book, presently serving as the Camel bible, has a free chapter one, which is highly recommended to read to get more familiar with Camel.
* The link:/blog/2022/08/pluralsight-training/[Fundamentals of Apache Camel] training by Michael Hoffman.

We strongly recommend that our users explore the pages above for additional material that suits their needs.

[[BookGettingStarted-OnlineJavadocDocumentation]]
== Online Javadoc documentation

Our API documentation in Javadoc format is available on https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/index.html[javadoc.io].

The Javadoc API that are the most relevant for Camel end users are in the following components (JARs):

* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/index.html[camel-core]
* https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-support/latest/index.html[camel-support]

[[BookGettingStarted-CreatingYourFirstProject]]
== Creating your first project

We'll start this guide by creating a simple integration. You need to have https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] and a https://adoptium.net/temurin/[JDK] version 11 or greater installed on your system.

*Note*: we strongly recommend you use an LTS version of Java (i.e., 11 or 17). We regularly test Camel in our continuous integration (CI) environment using Java's LTS versions.

== Generating the project

You will use one of the various https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[Maven archetypes] provided by Camel to create your first project. An archetype is a template for a project. In other words: Camel Core provides templates you can use to create projects.

Run this command to create your first Camel Core project:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-java -DarchetypeVersion=3.18.4 -Dpackage=org.apache.camel.learn -DgroupId=org.apache.camel.learn -DartifactId=first-camel-integration -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----

If you have never used archetypes before, the command looks lengthy. We'll explain the relevant arguments:

* `-DarchetypeArtifactId`: this is the ID of the archetype to use (i.e., which of the templates from Camel Core to use - `camel-archetype-java` in this case)
* `-DarchetypeVersion`: this is the version of the archetype to use. It is also the same version of Camel to use for the example. We are using `3.18.4` in this example.
* `-Dpackage`: the package name for the project you are creating. We'll use `org.apache.camel.learn` in all this guide.
* `-DgroupId`: the group ID for the project you are creating. We'll use `org.apache.camel.learn` in all this guide.
* `-DartifactId`: the artifact name for the project you are creating.
* `-Dversion`: the version for your project.

*Note*: later we will describe other ways to generate a Camel project.

== Building and running the project

You can run the following command to build the project:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

To run the project you can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn camel:run -Dcamel.main.durationMaxMessages=2
----

After you run the command above, you should have the following messages:

[source,bash]
----

If you can see an output like that on your terminal, it means the integration has run well.

The integration you have just run consumed two files and copied them to a directory based on their contents. You can check it out yourself but looking at the `target/messages` directory within the project:

[source,bash]
----
find target/messages
----

You should have the following files:

----
target/messages
target/messages/others
target/messages/others/message2.xml
target/messages/uk
target/messages/uk/message1.xml
----

*Note*: use the Windows Explorer or the Windows equivalent of the `find` command available on Linux, macOS or *BSDs.

== Understanding the project

The integration you created implements a pattern (E.I.P.) called xref:eips:choice-eip.adoc[Content Based Router]. The Camel implementation of this pattern allows you to implement logic that route messages based on their content.

More specifically, this integration looks at the content of the XML files in the `src/data` directory. If the content of the element `city` is London, then it moves the file to the directory `target/messages/uk`. Otherwise, it moves the file to the directory `target/messages/others`.

To create the integration that performs this task, this code declares a _route_ that connects a source _endpoint_ represented by the _address_ `file:src/data?noop=true` to two other _endpoints_ represented by the addresses `file:target/messages/uk` and `file:target/messages/others`.

Do not worry if you feel overwhelmed by the technical jargon. In the next section we will explain what each of these are and why they are important for Camel-based integrations.

[[BookGettingStarted-ConceptsAndTerminologyFundamentalToCamel]]
== Concepts and terminology fundamental to Camel

In this section, we explain some of Camelâ€™s fundamental concepts and features. We also introduce you to basic enterprise integration terminology.

[[BookGettingStarted-Endpoint]]
=== Endpoint
When we talk about inter-process communication, such as client/server or microservices, we often use the term _endpoint_ to refer to a software entity. In this context, a characteristic of an endpoint is that it is contactable at an _address_. The address may itself convey additional characteristics of an endpoint. For instance, the address `host:port` conveys both the port and network name of a TCP-based communication endpoint.

The distinction between the address and the software contactable at that address is often not important.

*Note*: in the past, other technologies (such as CORBA) used the terminology _endpoint_ in ways that could appear ambiguous. To prevent any confusion, we clarify that Camel uses it solely in the way we have described above.

Camel provides out-of-the-box support for endpoints implemented with many communication technologies. Here are some examples of the supported endpoint technologies:

* A JMS queue.
* A web service.
* A file. A file may sound like an unlikely type of endpoint, until you
realize that in some systems one application might write information to
a file and, later, another application might read that file.
* An FTP server.
* An email address. A client can send a message to an email address, and
a server can read an incoming message from a mail server.
* A POJO (plain old Java object).

In a Camel-based application, you create (Camel wrappers around) some
endpoints and connect these endpoints with __routes__, which I will
discuss later in xref:index.adoc[Section ("Routes,
RouteBuilders and Java DSL")]. Camel defines a Java interface called
`Endpoint`. Each Camel-supported endpoint has a class that implements
this `Endpoint` interface. As I discussed in
xref:index.adoc[Section ("Online Javadoc
documentation")], Camel provides a separate Javadoc hierarchy for each
communications technology supported by Camel. Because of this, you will
find documentation on, say, the `JmsEndpoint` class in the
http://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-jms/latest/[JMS Javadoc
hierarchy], while documentation for, say, the `FtpEndpoint` class is in
the http://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-ftp/latest/[FTP Javadoc
hierarchy].

[[BookGettingStarted-CamelContext]]
=== CamelContext

A `CamelContext` object represents the Camel runtime system. You
typically have one `CamelContext` object in an application. A typical
application executes the following steps:

1.  Create a `CamelContext` object.
2.  Add endpoints â€“ and possibly components, which are discussed in
Section ("Components") â€“ to the
`CamelContext` object.
3.  Add routes to the `CamelContext` object to connect the endpoints.
4.  Invoke the `start()` operation on the `CamelContext` object. This
starts Camel-internal threads that are used to process the sending,
receiving and processing of messages in the endpoints.
5.  Eventually invoke the `stop()` operation on the `CamelContext`
object. Doing this gracefully stops all the endpoints and Camel-internal
threads.

Note that the `CamelContext.start()` operation does not block
indefinitely. Rather, it starts threads internal to each `Component` and
`Endpoint` and then `start()` returns. Conversely, `CamelContext.stop()`
waits for all the threads internal to each `Endpoint` and `Component` to
terminate and then `stop()` returns.

If you neglect to call `CamelContext.start()` in your application then
messages will not be processed because internal threads will not have
been created.

If you neglect to call `CamelContext.stop()` before terminating your
application then the application may terminate in an inconsistent state.
If you neglect to call `CamelContext.stop()` in a JUnit test then the
test may fail due to messages not having had a chance to be fully
processed.

[[BookGettingStarted-CamelTemplate]]
=== CamelTemplate

Camel used to have a class called `CamelClient`, but this was renamed to
be `CamelTemplate` to be similar to a naming convention used in some
other open-source projects, such as the `TransactionTemplate` and
`JmsTemplate` classes in http://www.springframework.org/[Spring].

The `CamelTemplate` class is a thin wrapper around the `CamelContext`
class. It has methods that send a `Message` or `Exchange` â€“ both
discussed in xref:index.adoc[Section ("Message and
Exchange")]) â€“ to an `Endpoint` â€“ discussed in
Section ("Endpoint"). This provides
a way to enter messages into source endpoints, so that the messages will
move along routes â€“ discussed in xref:index.adoc[Section
 ("Routes, RouteBuilders and Java DSL")] â€“ to destination endpoints.

[[BookGettingStarted-url-uri-urn-iri]]

[[BookGettingStarted-TheMeaningofURL,URI,URNandIRI]]
=== The Meaning of URL, URI, URN and IRI

Some Camel methods take a parameter that is a _URI_ string. Many people
know that a URI is "something like a URL" but do not properly understand
the relationship between URI and URL, or indeed its relationship with
other acronyms such as IRI and URN.

Most people are familiar with _URLs_ (uniform resource locators), such
as `\http://...`, `\ftp://...`, `\mailto:...:`. Put simply, a URL specifies
the _location_ of a resource.

A _URI_ (uniform resource identifier) is a URL _or_ a URN. So, to fully
understand what URI means, you need to first understand what is a URN. +
_URN_ is an acronym for __uniform resource name__. There are many "unique
identifier" schemes in the world, for example, ISBNs (globally unique
for books), social security numbers (unique within a country), customer
numbers (unique within a company's customers database) and telephone
numbers. Each "unique identifier" scheme has its own notation. A URN is
a wrapper for different "unique identifier" schemes. The syntax of a URN
is `urn:<scheme-name>:<unique-identifier>`. A URN uniquely identifies a
_resource_, such as a book, person or piece of equipment. By itself, a
URN does not specify the _location_ of the resource. Instead, it is
assumed that a _registry_ provides a mapping from a resource's URN to
its location. The URN specification does not state what form a registry
takes, but it might be a database, a server application, a wall chart or
anything else that is convenient. Some hypothetical examples of URNs are
`urn:employee:08765245`, `urn:customer:uk:3458:hul8` and
`urn:foo:0000-0000-9E59-0000-5E-2`. The `<scheme-name>` (`employee`,
`customer` and `foo` in these examples) part of a URN implicitly defines
how to parse and interpret the `<unique-identifier>` that follows it. An
arbitrary URN is meaningless unless: (1) you know the semantics implied
by the `<scheme-name>`, and (2) you have access to the registry
appropriate for the `<scheme-name>`. A registry does not have to be public
or globally accessible. For example, `urn:employee:08765245` might be
meaningful only within a specific company.

To date, URNs are not (yet) as popular as URLs. For this reason, URI is
widely misused as a synonym for URL.

_IRI_ is an acronym for __internationalized resource identifier__. An
IRI is simply an internationalized version of a URI. In particular, a
URI can contain letters and digits in the US-ASCII character set, while
a IRI can contain those same letters and digits, and _also_ European
accented characters, Greek letters, Chinese ideograms and so on.

[[BookGettingStarted-Components]]
=== Components

_Component_ is confusing terminology; _EndpointFactory_ would have been
more appropriate because a `Component` is a factory for creating
`Endpoint` instances. For example, if a Camel-based application uses
several JMS queues then the application will create one instance of the
`JmsComponent` class (which implements the `Component` interface), and
then the application invokes the `createEndpoint()` operation on this
`JmsComponent` object several times. Each invocation of
`JmsComponent.createEndpoint()` creates an instance of the `JmsEndpoint`
class (which implements the `Endpoint` interface). Actually,
application-level code does not invoke `Component.createEndpoint()`
directly. Instead, application-level code normally invokes
`CamelContext.getEndpoint()`; internally, the `CamelContext` object
finds the desired `Component` object (as I will discuss shortly) and
then invokes `createEndpoint()` on it.

Consider the following code:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3://john.smith@mailserv.example.com?password=myPassword");
----

The parameter to `getEndpoint()` is a URI. The URI _prefix_ (that is,
the part before `:`) specifies the name of a component. Internally, the
`CamelContext` object maintains a mapping from names of components to
`Component` objects. For the URI given in the above example, the
`CamelContext` object would probably map the `pop3` prefix to an
instance of the `MailComponent` class. Then the `CamelContext` object
invokes
`createEndpoint("pop3://john.smith@mailserv.example.com?password=myPassword")`
on that `MailComponent` object. The `createEndpoint()` operation splits
the URI into its component parts and uses these parts to create and
configure an `Endpoint` object. +
In the previous paragraph, I mentioned that a `CamelContext` object
maintains a mapping from component names to `Component` objects. This
raises the question of how this map is populated with named `Component`
objects. There are two ways of populating the map. The first way is for
application-level code to invoke
`CamelContext.addComponent(String componentName, Component component)`.
The example below shows a single `MailComponent` object being registered
in the map under 3 different names.

[source,java]
----
Component mailComponent = new org.apache.camel.component.mail.MailComponent();
myCamelContext.addComponent("pop3", mailComponent);
myCamelContext.addComponent("imap", mailComponent);
myCamelContext.addComponent("smtp", mailComponent);
----

The second (and preferred) way to populate the map of named `Component`
objects in the `CamelContext` object is to let the `CamelContext` object
perform lazy initialization. This approach relies on developers
following a convention when they write a class that implements the
`Component` interface. I illustrate the convention by an example. Let's
assume you write a class called `com.example.myproject.FooComponent` and
you want Camel to automatically recognize this by the name `foo`. To do
this, you have to write a properties file called
`META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo` (without a
`.properties` file extension) that has a single entry in it called
`class`, the value of which is the fully-scoped name of your class. This
is shown below:

.META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo
[source]
----
class=com.example.myproject.FooComponent
----

If you want Camel to also recognize the class by the name `bar` then you
write another properties file in the same directory called `bar` that
has the same contents. Once you have written the properties file(s), you
create a JAR file that contains the `com.example.myproject.FooComponent`
class and the properties file(s), and you add this jar file to your
CLASSPATH. Then, when application-level code invokes
`createEndpoint("foo:...")` on a `CamelContext` object, Camel will find
the "foo"" properties file on the CLASSPATH, get the value of the
`class` property from that properties file, and use reflection APIs to
create an instance of the specified class.

As I said in Section ("Endpoint"),
Camel provides out-of-the-box support for numerous communication
technologies. The out-of-the-box support consists of classes that
implement the `Component` interface plus properties files that enable a
`CamelContext` object to populate its map of named `Component`
objects.

Earlier in this section I gave the following example of calling
`CamelContext.getEndpoint()`:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3://john.smith@mailserv.example.com?password=myPassword");
----

When I originally gave that example, I said that the parameter to
`getEndpoint()` was a URI. I said that because the online Camel
documentation and the Camel source code both claim the parameter is a
URI. In reality, the parameter is restricted to being a URL. This is
because when Camel extracts the component name from the parameter, it
looks for the first ":", which is a simplistic algorithm. To understand
why, recall from xref:index.adoc[Section ("The
Meaning of URL, URI, URN and IRI")] that a URI can be a URL _or_ a URN.
Now consider the following calls to `getEndpoint`:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("jms:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("urn:foo:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("urn:bar:...");
----

Camel identifies the components in the above example as `pop3`, `jms`,
`urn` and `urn`. It would be more useful if the latter components were
identified as `urn:foo` and `urn:bar` or, alternatively, as `foo` and
`bar` (that is, by skipping over the `urn:` prefix). So, in practice you
must identify an endpoint with a URL (a string of the form
`<scheme>:...`) rather than with a URN (a string of the form
`urn:<scheme>:...`). This lack of proper support for URNs means the you
should consider the parameter to `getEndpoint()` as being a URL rather
than (as claimed) a URI.

[[BookGettingStarted-message-and-exchange]]

[[BookGettingStarted-MessageandExchange]]
=== Message and Exchange

The `Message` interface provides an abstraction for a single message,
such as a request, reply or exception message.

There are concrete classes that implement the `Message` interface for
each Camel-supported communications technology. For example, the
`JmsMessage` class provides a JMS-specific implementation of the
`Message` interface. The public API of the `Message` interface provides
get- and set-style methods to access the _message id_, _body_ and
individual _header_ fields of a message.

The `Exchange` interface provides an abstraction for an exchange of
messages, that is, a request message and its corresponding reply or
exception message. In Camel terminology, the request, reply and
exception messages are called _in_, _out_ and _fault_ messages.

There are concrete classes that implement the `Exchange` interface for
each Camel-supported communications technology. For example, the
`JmsExchange` class provides a JMS-specific implementation of the
`Exchange` interface. The public API of the `Exchange` interface is
quite limited. This is intentional, and it is expected that each class
that implements this interface will provide its own technology-specific
operations.

Application-level programmers rarely access the `Exchange` interface (or
classes that implement it) directly. However, many classes in Camel are
generic types that are instantiated on (a class that implements)
`Exchange`. Because of this, the `Exchange` interface appears a lot in
the generic signatures of classes and methods.

[[BookGettingStarted-Processor]]
=== Processor

The `Processor` interface represents a class that processes a message.
The signature of this interface is shown below:

.Processor
[source,java]
----
package org.apache.camel;
public interface Processor {
    void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception;
}
----

Notice that the parameter to the `process()` method is an `Exchange`
rather than a `Message`. This provides flexibility. For example, an
implementation of this method initially might call `exchange.getIn()` to
get the input message and process it. If an error occurs during
processing then the method can call `exchange.setException()`.

An application-level developer might implement the `Processor` interface
with a class that executes some business logic. However, there are many
classes in the Camel library that implement the `Processor` interface in
a way that provides support for a design pattern in the
EIP book. For example, `ChoiceProcessor`
implements the message router pattern, that is, it uses a cascading
if-then-else statement to route a message from an input queue to one of
several output queues. Another example is the `FilterProcessor` class
which discards messages that do not satisfy a stated _predicate_ (that
is, condition).

[[BookGettingStarted-routes]]

[[BookGettingStarted-Routes,RouteBuildersandJavaDSL]]
=== Routes, RouteBuilders and Java DSL

A _route_ is the step-by-step movement of a `Message` from an input
queue, through arbitrary types of decision making (such as filters and
routers) to a destination queue (if any). Camel provides three ways for an
application developer to specify routes. First two ways is to specify route
information in an XML or YAML file. A discussion of that approach is outside the
scope of this document. The other way is through what Camel calls a Java
_DSL_ (domain-specific language).

[[BookGettingStarted-IntroductiontoJavaDSL]]
==== Introduction to Java DSL

For many people, the term "domain-specific language" implies a compiler
or interpreter that can process an input file containing keywords and
syntax specific to a particular domain. This is _not_ the approach taken
by Camel. Camel documentation consistently uses the term "Java DSL"
instead of "DSL", but this does not entirely avoid potential confusion.
The Camel "Java DSL" is a class library that can be used in a way that
looks almost like a DSL, except that it has a bit of Java syntactic
baggage. You can see this in the example below. Comments afterwards
explain some of the constructs used in the example.

.*Example of Camel's "Java DSL"*
[source,java]
----
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
        from("queue:a").filter(header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")).to("queue:b");

        from("queue:c").choice()
                .when(header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")).to("queue:d")
                .when(header("foo").isEqualTo("cheese")).to("queue:e")
                .otherwise().to("queue:f");
    }
};
CamelContext myCamelContext = new DefaultCamelContext();
myCamelContext.addRoutes(builder);
----

The first line in the above example creates an object which is an
instance of an anonymous subclass of `RouteBuilder` with the specified
`configure()` method.

The `CamelContext.addRoutes(RouterBuilder builder)` method invokes
`builder.setContext(this)` â€“ so the `RouteBuilder` object knows which
`CamelContext` object it is associated with â€“ and then invokes
`builder.configure()`. The body of `configure()` invokes methods such as
`from()`, `filter()`, `choice()`, `when()`, `isEqualTo()`, `otherwise()`
and `to()`.

The `RouteBuilder.from(String uri)` method invokes `getEndpoint(uri)` on
the `CamelContext` associated with the `RouteBuilder` object to get the
specified `Endpoint` and then puts a `FromBuilder` _wrapper_ around this
`Endpoint`. The `FromBuilder.filter(Predicate predicate)` method creates
a `FilterProcessor` object for the `Predicate` (that is, condition)
object built from the `header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")` expression. In
this way, these operations incrementally build up a `Route` object (with
a `RouteBuilder` wrapper around it) and add it to the `CamelContext`
object associated with the `RouteBuilder`.
