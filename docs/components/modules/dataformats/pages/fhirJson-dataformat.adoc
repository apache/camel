The FHIR-JSON Data Format leverages
https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/blob/master/hapi-fhir-base/src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/parser/JsonParser.java[HAPI-FHIR's]
JSON parser to parse to/from JSON format to/from a HAPI-FHIR's `IBaseResource`.

== FHIR JSON Format Options

// dataformat options: START
The FHIR JSon dataformat supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2s,1m,1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Default | Java Type | Description
| fhirVersion | DSTU3 | String | The version of FHIR to use. Possible values are: DSTU2,DSTU2_HL7ORG,DSTU2_1,DSTU3,R4. There are 5 enums and the value can be one of: DSTU2, DSTU2_1, DSTU2_HL7ORG, DSTU3, R4
| prettyPrint | false | Boolean | Sets the pretty print flag, meaning that the parser will encode resources with human-readable spacing and newlines between elements instead of condensing output as much as possible.
| serverBaseUrl |  | String | Sets the server's base URL used by this parser. If a value is set, resource references will be turned into relative references if they are provided as absolute URLs but have a base matching the given base.
| omitResourceId | false | Boolean | If set to true (default is false) the ID of any resources being encoded will not be included in the output. Note that this does not apply to contained resources, only to root resources. In other words, if this is set to true, contained resources will still have local IDs but the outer/containing ID will not have an ID.
| encodeElementsAppliesToChildResourcesOnly | false | Boolean | If set to true (default is false), the values supplied to setEncodeElements(Set) will not be applied to the root resource (typically a Bundle), but will be applied to any sub-resources contained within it (i.e. search result resources in that bundle)
| encodeElements |  | Set | If provided, specifies the elements which should be encoded, to the exclusion of all others. Valid values for this field would include: Patient - Encode patient and all its children Patient.name - Encode only the patient's name Patient.name.family - Encode only the patient's family name .text - Encode the text element on any resource (only the very first position may contain a wildcard) .(mandatory) - This is a special case which causes any mandatory fields (min 0) to be encoded
| dontEncodeElements |  | Set | If provided, specifies the elements which should NOT be encoded. Valid values for this field would include: Patient - Don't encode patient and all its children Patient.name - Don't encode the patient's name Patient.name.family - Don't encode the patient's family name .text - Don't encode the text element on any resource (only the very first position may contain a wildcard) DSTU2 note: Note that values including meta, such as Patient.meta will work for DSTU2 parsers, but values with subelements on meta such as Patient.meta.lastUpdated will only work in DSTU3 mode.
| stripVersionsFromReferences | false | Boolean | If set to true (which is the default), resource references containing a version will have the version removed when the resource is encoded. This is generally good behaviour because in most situations, references from one resource to another should be to the resource by ID, not by ID and version. In some cases though, it may be desirable to preserve the version in resource links. In that case, this value should be set to false. This method provides the ability to globally disable reference encoding. If finer-grained control is needed, use setDontStripVersionsFromReferencesAtPaths(List)
| overrideResourceIdWithBundleEntryFullUrl | false | Boolean | If set to true (which is the default), the Bundle.entry.fullUrl will override the Bundle.entry.resource's resource id if the fullUrl is defined. This behavior happens when parsing the source data into a Bundle object. Set this to false if this is not the desired behavior (e.g. the client code wishes to perform additional validation checks between the fullUrl and the resource id).
| summaryMode | false | Boolean | If set to true (default is false) only elements marked by the FHIR specification as being summary elements will be included.
| suppressNarratives | false | Boolean | If set to true (default is false), narratives will not be included in the encoded values.
| dontStripVersionsFromReferencesAtPaths |  | List | If supplied value(s), any resource references at the specified paths will have their resource versions encoded instead of being automatically stripped during the encoding process. This setting has no effect on the parsing process. This method provides a finer-grained level of control than setStripVersionsFromReferences(String) and any paths specified by this method will be encoded even if setStripVersionsFromReferences(String) has been set to true (which is the default)
| contentTypeHeader | true | Boolean | Whether the data format should set the Content-Type header with the type from the data format. For example application/xml for data formats marshalling to XML, or application/json for data formats marshalling to JSON
