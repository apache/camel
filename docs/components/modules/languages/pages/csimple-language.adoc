*Since Camel {since}*

The CSimple language is *compiled* xref:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language.

== Different between CSimple and Simple

The simple language is a dynamic expression language which is runtime parsed into a set of Camel Expressions or Predicates.

The csimple language is parsed into regular Java source code and compiled together with all the other source code,
or compiled once during bootstrap via the `camel-csimple-joor` module.

The simple langauge is generally very lightweight and fast, however for some use-cases with dynamic method calls via OGNL paths,
then the simple language does runtime introspection and reflection calls. This has an overhead on performance,
and was one of the reasons why csimple was created.

The csimple language requires to be typesafe and method calls via OGNL paths requires to know the type during parsing.
This means for csimple languages expressions you would need to provide the class type in the script,
where as simple introspects this at runtime.

In other words the simple language is using _duck typing_ (if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck)
and csimple is using Java type (typesafety). If there is a type error then simple will report this at runtime,
and with csimple there will be a Java compilation error.

== Compilation

The csimple language is parsed into regular Java source code and compiled together with all the other source code, or it can be compiled once during bootstrap via the `camel-csimple-joor` module.

There are two ways to compile csimple

- using the `camel-csimple-maven-plugin` generating source code at built time.
- using `camel-csimple-joor` which does runtime in-memory compilation during bootstrap of Camel.

=== Using camel-csimple-maven-plugin

The `camel-csimple-maven-plugin` Maven plugin is used for discoving all the csimple scripts from the source code, and then automatic generate source code in the `src/generated/java` folder, which then gets compiled together with all the other sources.

The maven plugin will do source code scanning of `.java` and `.xml` files (Java and XML DSL).
The scanner limits to detect certain code patterns, and it may miss discovering some csimple scripts if they are being used in unusual/rare ways.

The runtime compilation using `camel-csimple-joor` does not have this limitation.

However the pros is that all of the csimple scripts will be compiled using the regular Java compiler and therefore everything
is included out of the box as `.class` files in the application JAR file, and no additional dependencies is required at runtime.

To use `camel-csimple-maven-plugin` you need to add it to your `pom.xml` file as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
    <!-- generate source code for csimple languages -->
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-csimple-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${camel.version}</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <id>generate</id>
                <goals>
                    <goal>generate</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
    <!-- include source code generated to maven sources paths -->
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.1.0</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <phase>generate-sources</phase>
                <goals>
                    <goal>add-source</goal>
                    <goal>add-resource</goal>
                </goals>
                <configuration>
                    <sources>
                        <source>src/generated/java</source>
                    </sources>
                    <resources>
                        <resource>
                            <directory>src/generated/resources</directory>
                        </resource>
                    </resources>
                </configuration>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
----

And then you must also add the `build-helper-maven-plugin` Maven plugin to include `src/generated` to the list of source folders for the Java compiler,
to ensure the generated source code is compiled and included in the application JAR file.

See the `camel-example-csimple` example at https://github.com/apache/camel-examples[Camel Examples] which uses the maven plugin.

=== Using camel-csimple-joor

The jOOR library integrates with the Java compiler and performs runtime compilation of Java code.

The supported runtime when using `camel-simple-joor` is intended for Java standalone, Spring Boot, Camel Quarkus and other microservices runtimes.
It is not supported in OSGi, Camel Karaf or any kind of Java Application Server runtime.

jOOR does not support runtime compilation with Spring Boot using _fat jar_ packaging (https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOR/issues/69),
it works with exploded classpath.

To use `camel-simple-joor` you simply just add it as dependency to the classpath:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-csimple-joor</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----

There is no need for adding Maven plugins to the `pom.xml` file.

See the `camel-example-csimple-joor` example at https://github.com/apache/camel-examples[Camel Examples] which uses the jOOR compiler.

== CSimple Language options

// language options: START
The CSimple language supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,1m,1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Default | Java Type | Description
| resultType |  | String | Sets the class name of the result type (type from output)
| trim | true | Boolean | Whether to trim the value to remove leading and trailing whitespaces and line breaks
|===
// language options: END

== Limitations

Currently the csimple language does **not** support the _null safe_ operator (`?`).

For example the following script cannot compile:

[source,text]
----
    ${bodyAs(MyUser)?.address?.zip} > 10000
----

== More documentation

See the xref:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language as csimple has the same set of functions as simple language.
