*Since Camel {since}*

The microprofile-health component is used for bridging https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-health[Eclipse MicroProfile Health] checks with Camel's own Health Check API.

This enables you to write checks using the Camel health APIs and have them exposed via MicroProfile Health readiness and liveness checks.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-microprofile-health</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

== Usage

By default, Camel health checks are registered as both MicroProfile Health liveness and readiness checks. To have finer control over whether a Camel health check should
be considered either a readiness or liveness check, you can extend the `AbstractCamelMicroProfileLivenessCheck` and `AbstractCamelMicroProfileReadinessCheck` classes.

For example, to have a check registered exclusively as a liveness check:

[source,java]
----
public class MyHealthCheck extends AbstractCamelMicroProfileLivenessCheck {

    public MyHealthCheck() {
        super("my-liveness-check-id");
        getConfiguration().setEnabled(true);
    }

    @Override
    protected void doCall(HealthCheckResultBuilder builder, Map<String, Object> options) {
        builder.detail("some-detail-key", "some-value");

        if (someSuccessCondition) {
            builder.up();
        } else {
            builder.down();
        }
    }
}
----

== Auto discovery

The expectation is that this component is run within a MicroProfile container, where CDI and a library implementing the MicroProfile health specification is available.
E.g https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-health[SmallRye Health].

In this scenario, the readiness and liveness checks are automatically discovered and registered for you.

However, it's still possible to manually
register Health checks without CDI. Ensure your camel health checks are available in the Camel registry and add an instance of
`CamelMicroProfileReadinessCheck` and `CamelMicroProfileLivenessCheck` to the health check registry of your MicroProfile Health implementation.
