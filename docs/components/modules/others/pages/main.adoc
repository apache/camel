*Since Camel {since}*

This module is used for running Camel standalone via a main class extended from `camel-main`.

== Configuration options

When running Camel via `camel-main` you can configure Camel in the `application.properties` file.

The following table lists all the options:

// main options: START
[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.main.allowUseOriginal{zwsp}Message* | Sets whether to allow access to the original message from Camel's error handler, or from org.apache.camel.spi.UnitOfWork.getOriginalInMessage(). Turning this off can optimize performance, as defensive copy of the original message is not needed. Default is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}Enabled* | Whether auto configuration of components, dataformats, languages is enabled or not. When enabled the configuration parameters are loaded from the properties component and optionally from the classpath file META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/autowire.properties. You can prefix the parameters in the properties file with: - camel.component.name.option1=value1 - camel.component.name.option2=value2 - camel.dataformat.name.option1=value1 - camel.dataformat.name.option2=value2 - camel.language.name.option1=value1 - camel.language.name.option2=value2 Where name is the name of the component, dataformat or language such as seda,direct,jaxb. The auto configuration also works for any options on components that is a complex type (not standard Java type) and there has been an explicit single bean instance registered to the Camel registry via the org.apache.camel.spi.Registry#bind(String,Object) method or by using the org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry annotation style. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}EnvironmentVariablesEnabled* | Whether auto configuration should include OS environment variables as well. When enabled this allows to overrule any configuration using an OS environment variable. For example to set a shutdown timeout of 5 seconds: CAMEL_MAIN_SHUTDOWNTIMEOUT=5. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}FailFast* | Whether auto configuration should fail fast when configuring one ore more properties fails for whatever reason such as a invalid property name, etc. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoConfiguration{zwsp}LogSummary* | Whether auto configuration should log a summary with the configured properties. This option is default enabled. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autoStartup* | Sets whether the object should automatically start when Camel starts. Important: Currently only routes can be disabled, as CamelContext's are always started. Note: When setting auto startup false on CamelContext then that takes precedence and no routes are started. You would need to start CamelContext explicit using the org.apache.camel.CamelContext.start() method, to start the context, and then you would need to start the routes manually using CamelContext.getRouteController().startRoute(String). Default is true to always start up. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.autowiredEnabled* | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. Default is true. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.backlogTracing* | Sets whether backlog tracing is enabled or not. Default is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.beanIntrospection{zwsp}ExtendedStatistics* | Sets whether bean introspection uses extended statistics. The default is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.beanIntrospection{zwsp}LoggingLevel* | Sets the logging level used by bean introspection, logging activity of its usage. The default is TRACE. |  | LoggingLevel
| *camel.main.beanPostProcessor{zwsp}Enabled* | Can be used to turn off bean post processing. Be careful to turn this off, as this means that beans that use Camel annotations such as org.apache.camel.EndpointInject , org.apache.camel.ProducerTemplate , org.apache.camel.Produce , org.apache.camel.Consume etc will not be injected and in use. Turning this off should only be done if you are sure you do not use any of these Camel features. Not all runtimes allow turning this off (such as camel-blueprint or camel-cdi with XML). The default value is true (enabled). | true | boolean
| *camel.main.caseInsensitive{zwsp}Headers* | Whether to use case sensitive or insensitive headers. Important: When using case sensitive (this is set to false). Then the map is case sensitive which means headers such as content-type and Content-Type are two different keys which can be a problem for some protocols such as HTTP based, which rely on case insensitive headers. However case sensitive implementations can yield faster performance. Therefore use case sensitive implementation with care. Default is true. | true | boolean
| *camel.main.configuration{zwsp}Classes* | Sets classes names that will be used to configure the camel context as example by providing custom beans through org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry annotation. |  | String
| *camel.main.configurations* | Sets the configuration objects used to configure the camel context. |  | List

| *camel.main.durationMaxSeconds* | To specify for how long time in seconds to keep running the JVM before automatic terminating the JVM. You can use this to run Camel for a short while. |  | int
| *camel.main.endpointBasic{zwsp}PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities. The default value is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.endpointBridgeError{zwsp}Handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored. The default value is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.endpointLazyStart{zwsp}Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. The default value is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.endpointRuntime{zwsp}StatisticsEnabled* | Sets whether endpoint runtime statistics is enabled (gathers runtime usage of each incoming and outgoing endpoints). The default value is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.fileConfigurations* | Directory to load additional configuration files that contains configuration values that takes precedence over any other configuration. This can be used to refer to files that may have secret configuration that has been mounted on the file system for containers. You can specify a pattern to load from sub directories and a name pattern such as /var/app/secret/.properties, multiple directories can be separated by comma. |  | String
| *camel.main.inflightRepository{zwsp}BrowseEnabled* | Sets whether the inflight repository should allow browsing each inflight exchange. This is by default disabled as there is a very slight performance overhead when enabled. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.javaRoutesExclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for exclusive filtering component scanning of RouteBuilder classes with Component annotation. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma. For example to exclude all classes starting with Bar use: &#42;&#42;/Bar&#42; To exclude all routes form a specific package use: com/mycompany/bar/&#42; To exclude all routes form a specific package and its sub-packages use double wildcards: com/mycompany/bar/&#42;&#42; And to exclude all routes from two specific packages use: com/mycompany/bar/&#42;,com/mycompany/stuff/&#42; |  | String
| *camel.main.javaRoutesInclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for inclusive filtering component scanning of RouteBuilder classes with Component annotation. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern. Multiple patterns can be specified separated by comma.

| *camel.main.loadTypeConverters* | Whether to load custom type converters by scanning classpath. This is used for backwards compatibility with Camel 2.x. Its recommended to migrate to use fast type converter loading by setting Converter(loader = true) on your custom type converter classes. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.logDebugMaxChars* | Is used to limit the maximum length of the logging Camel message bodies. If the message body is longer than the limit, the log message is clipped. Use -1 to have unlimited length. Use for example 1000 to log at most 1000 characters. |  | int
| *camel.main.logExhaustedMessage{zwsp}Body* | Sets whether to log exhausted message body with message history. Default is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.logMask* | Sets whether log mask is enabled or not. Default is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.mdcLoggingKeys{zwsp}Pattern* | Sets the pattern used for determine which custom MDC keys to propagate during message routing when the routing engine continues routing asynchronously for the given message. Setting this pattern to will propagate all custom keys. Or setting the pattern to foo,bar will propagate any keys starting with either foo or bar. Notice that a set of standard Camel MDC keys are always propagated which starts with camel. as key name. The match rules are applied in this order (case insensitive): 1. exact match, returns true 2. wildcard match (pattern ends with a and the name starts with the pattern), returns true 3. regular expression match, returns true 4. otherwise returns false |  | String
| *camel.main.messageHistory* | Sets whether message history is enabled or not. Default is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.name* | Sets the name of the CamelContext. |  | String
| *camel.main.packageScanRoute{zwsp}Builders* | Sets package names for scanning for org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder classes as candidates to be included.

In other words only use this for Camel Main in standalone mode. |  | String
| *camel.main.producerTemplate{zwsp}CacheSize* | Producer template endpoints cache size. | 1000 | int
| *camel.main.routeControllerBack{zwsp}OffDelay* | Backoff delay in millis when restarting a route that failed to startup. |  | long

| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}SuperviseEnabled* | To enable using supervising route controller which allows Camel to startup and then the controller takes care of starting the routes in a safe manner. This can be used when you want to startup Camel despite a route may otherwise fail fast during startup and cause Camel to fail to startup as well. By delegating the route startup to the supervising route controller then its manages the startup using a background thread. The controller allows to be configured with various settings to attempt to restart failing routes. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}ThreadPoolSize* | The number of threads used by the route controller scheduled thread pool that are used for restarting routes. The pool uses 1 thread by default, but you can increase this to allow the controller to concurrently attempt to restart multiple routes in case more than one route has problems starting. |  | int
| *camel.main.routeController{zwsp}UnhealthyOnExhausted* | Whether to mark the route as unhealthy (down) when all restarting attempts (backoff) have failed and the route is not successfully started and the route manager is giving up. Setting this to true allows health checks to know about this and can report the Camel application as DOWN. The default is false. |  | boolean
| *camel.main.routeFilterExclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for filtering routes routes matching the given pattern, which follows the following rules: - Match by route id - Match by route input endpoint uri The matching is using exact match, by wildcard and regular expression as documented by PatternHelper#matchPattern(String,String) . For example to only include routes which starts with foo in their route id's, use: include=foo&#42; And to exclude routes which starts from JMS endpoints, use: exclude=jms:&#42; Multiple patterns can be separated by comma, for example to exclude both foo and bar routes, use: exclude=foo&#42;,bar&#42; Exclude takes precedence over include. |  | String
| *camel.main.routeFilterInclude{zwsp}Pattern* | Used for filtering routes matching the given pattern, which follows the following rules: - Match by route id - Match by route input endpoint uri The matching is using exact match, by wildcard and regular expression as documented by PatternHelper#matchPattern(String,String) .

| *camel.hystrix.maxQueueSize* | Max queue size that gets passed to BlockingQueue in HystrixConcurrencyStrategy.getBlockingQueue(int) This should only affect the instantiation of a threadpool - it is not eliglible to change a queue size on the fly. For that, use queueSizeRejectionThreshold(). |  | Integer
| *camel.hystrix.metricsHealth{zwsp}SnapshotIntervalInMilliseconds* | Time in milliseconds to wait between allowing health snapshots to be taken that calculate success and error percentages and affect HystrixCircuitBreaker.isOpen() status. On high-volume circuits the continual calculation of error percentage can become CPU intensive thus this controls how often it is calculated. |  | Integer

== Specifying custom beans

Custom beans can be configured in `camel-main` via properties (such as in the `application.properties` file).

For example to create a `DataSource` for a Postgress database, you can create a new bean instance via `#class:` with the class name (fully qualified).
Properties on the data source can then additional configured such as the server and database name, etc.

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.myDS = #class:org.postgresql.jdbc3.Jdbc3PoolingDataSource
camel.beans.myDS.dataSourceName = myDS
camel.beans.myDS.serverName = mypostrgress
camel.beans.myDS.databaseName = test
camel.beans.myDS.user = testuser
camel.beans.myDS.password = testpassword
camel.beans.myDS.maxConnections = 10
----

The bean is registered in the Camel Registry with the name `myDS`.

If you use the SQL component then the datasource can be configured on the SQL component:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #myDS
----

To refer to a custom bean you may want to favour using `#bean:` style, as this states the intention more clearly that its referring to a bean,
and not just a text value that happens to start with a `#` sign:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #bean:myDS
----

=== Creating a custom bean with constructor parameters

When creating a bean then parameters to the constructor can be provided.
Suppose we have a class `MyFoo` with a constructor:

[source,java]
----
public class MyFoo {
    private String name;
    private boolean important;
    private int id;

    public MyFoo(String name, boolean important, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.important = important;
        this.id = id;
    }
}
----

Then we can create a bean instance with name `foo` and provide parameters to the constructor as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
----

=== Optional parameters on beans

If a parameter on a bean is not mandatory then the parameter can be marked as optional using `?` syntax, as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
camel.beans.foo.?company = Acme
----

Then the company parameter is only set if `MyBean` has this option (silent ignore if no option present).
Otherwise if a parameter is set and the bean does not have such a parameter, then an exception is thrown by Camel.

=== Nested parameters on beans

You can configure nested parameters separating them via `.` (dot).

For example given this `Country` class:

[source,java]
----
public class Country {
    private String iso;
    private String name;

    public void setIso(String iso) {
        this.iso = iso;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
----

Which is an option on the `MyBean` class.
Then we can then configure its iso and name parameter as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.foo = #class:com.foo.MyBean("Hello World", true, 123)
camel.beans.foo.country.iso = USA
camel.beans.foo.country.name = United States of America
----

Camel will automatic create an instance of `Country` if `MyBean` has a getter/setter for this option, and that the `Country` bean
has a default no-arg constructor.

=== Configuring singleton beans by their type

In the example above the SQL component was configured with the name of the `DataSource`. There can be situations where you know there is only
a single instance of a data source in the Camel registry. In such a situation you can instead refer to the class
or interface type via the `#type:` prefix as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #type:javax.sql.DataSource
----

If there is no bean in the registry with the type `javax.sql.DataSource` then the option isn't configured.

=== Autowiring beans

The example above can be taken one step further by letting `camel-main` try to autowire the beans.

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.sql.dataSource = #autowired
----

In this situation then `#autowrired` will make Camel detect the type of the `dataSource` option on the `SQL` component.
As the type is a `javax.sql.DataSource` instance, then Camel will lookup in the registry if there is a single instance of the same type.
If there is no such bean then the option isn't configured.

== Defining a Map bean

You can specify `java.util.Map` beans in `camel-main` via properties (such as in the `application.properties` file).

Maps have a special syntax with brackets as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.mymap[table] = 12
camel.beans.mymap[food] = Big Burger
camel.beans.mymap[cheese] = yes
camel.beans.mymap[quantity] = 1
----

The Map is registered in the Camel Registry with the name `mymap`.

== Defining a List bean

This is similar to Map bean where the key is the index, eg 0, 1, 2, etc:

[source,properties]
----
camel.beans.myprojects[0] = Camel
camel.beans.myprojects[1] = Kafka
camel.beans.myprojects[2] = Quarkus
----

The List is registered in the Camel Registry with the name `myprojects`.

== Examples

You can find a set of examples using `camel-main` in https://github.com/apache/camel-examples[Camel Examples]
which demonstrate running Camel in standalone with `camel-main`.
