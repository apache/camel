:description: Communicate with OData 2.0 services using Apache Olingo.
:since: 2.14
:supportLevel: Stable
:component-header: Both producer and consumer are supported

*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Olingo2 component utilizes http://olingo.apache.org/[Apache Olingo]
version 2.0 APIs to interact with OData 2.0 compliant services.
A number of popular commercial and enterprise vendors and products
support the OData protocol. A sample list of supporting products can be
found on the OData http://www.odata.org/ecosystem/[website].

The Olingo2 component supports reading feeds, delta feeds, entities,
simple and complex properties, links, counts, using custom and OData
system query parameters. It supports updating entities, properties, and
association links. It also supports submitting queries and change
requests as a single OData batch operation. 

The component supports configuring HTTP connection parameters and
headers for OData service connection. This allows configuring use of
SSL, OAuth2.0, etc. as required by the target OData service. 

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

== Olingo2 Options




// component options: START
The Olingo2 component supports 18 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (common) | To use the shared configuration |  | Olingo2Configuration
| *connectTimeout* (common) | HTTP connection creation timeout in milliseconds, defaults to 30,000 (30 seconds) | 30000 | int
| *contentType* (common) | Content-Type header value can be used to specify JSON or XML message format, defaults to application/json;charset=utf-8 | application/json;charset=utf-8 | String
| *entityProviderReadProperties* (common) | Custom entity provider read properties applied to all read operations. |  | EntityProviderReadProperties
| *entityProviderWriteProperties* (common) | Custom entity provider write properties applied to create, update, patch, batch and merge operations. For instance users can skip the Json object wrapper or enable content only mode when sending request data. A service URI set in the properties will always be overwritten by the serviceUri configuration parameter. Please consider to using the serviceUri configuration parameter instead of setting the respective write property here. |  | EntityProviderWriteProperties
| *filterAlreadySeen* (common) | Set this to true to filter out results that have already been communicated by this component. | false | boolean
| *httpHeaders* (common) | Custom HTTP headers to inject into every request, this could include OAuth tokens, etc. |  | Map
| *proxy* (common) | HTTP proxy server configuration |  | HttpHost
| *serviceUri* (common) | Target OData service base URI, e.g. \http://services.odata.org/OData/OData.svc |  | String
| *socketTimeout* (common) | HTTP request timeout in milliseconds, defaults to 30,000 (30 seconds) | 30000 | int
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *splitResult* (consumer) | For endpoints that return an array or collection, a consumer endpoint will map every element to distinct messages, unless splitResult is set to false. | true | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *httpAsyncClientBuilder* (advanced) | Custom HTTP async client builder for more complex HTTP client configuration, overrides connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy and sslContext. Note that a socketTimeout MUST be specified in the builder, otherwise OData requests could block indefinitely |  | HttpAsyncClientBuilder
| *httpClientBuilder* (advanced) | Custom HTTP client builder for more complex HTTP client configuration, overrides connectionTimeout, socketTimeout, proxy and sslContext. Note that a socketTimeout MUST be specified in the builder, otherwise OData requests could block indefinitely |  | HttpClientBuilder
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters |  | SSLContextParameters
| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: END

== Producer Endpoints

Producer endpoints can use endpoint names and options listed
next. Producer endpoints can also use a special option *`inBody`* that
in turn should contain the name of the endpoint option whose value will
be contained in the Camel Exchange In message. The *inBody* option
defaults to *data* for endpoints that take that option. 

== Endpoint Options

Any of the endpoint options can be provided in either the endpoint URI,
or dynamically in a message header. The message header name must be of
the format *`CamelOlingo2.<option>`*. Note that the *`inBody`* option
overrides message header, i.e. the endpoint
option *`inBody=option`* would override
a *`CamelOlingo2.option`* header. In addition, query parameters can be
specified. 

[width="100%",cols="10%,20%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description
|data |Object |Data with appropriate type used to create or modify the OData resource
|keyPredicate |String |Key predicate to create a parameterized OData resource endpoint. Useful for 
create/update operations where the key predicate value is dynamically provided in a header
|queryParams |java.util.Map<String,String> |OData system options and custom query options. For more 
information see http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/[OData 2.0 URI Conventions]
|resourcePath |String |OData resource path, may or may not contain key predicate
|endpointHttpHeaders |java.util.Map<String, String> |Dynamic HTTP Headers to be sent to the endpoint
|responseHttpHeaders |java.util.Map<String, String> |Dynamic HTTP Response Headers from the endpoint 
|=======================================================================

Note that the resourcePath option can either in specified in the URI as
a part of the URI path, as an endpoint option
?resourcePath=<resource-path> or as a header value
CamelOlingo2.resourcePath. The OData entity key predicate can either be
a part of the resource path, e.g. _Manufacturers('1')_, where _'__1'_ is
the key predicate, or be specified separately with resource path
_Manufacturers_ and keyPredicate option _'1'_. 

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Endpoint |Options |HTTP Method |Result Body Type

|batch |data, endpointHttpHeaders |POST with multipart/mixed batch request |java.util.List<org.apache.camel.component.olingo2.api.batch.Olingo2BatchResponse>

|create |data, resourcePath, endpointHttpHeaders |POST |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.ep.entry.ODataEntry for new entries
org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.commons.HttpStatusCodes for other OData resources

|delete |resourcePath, endpointHttpHeaders |DELETE |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.commons.HttpStatusCodes

|merge |data, resourcePath, endpointHttpHeaders |MERGE |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.commons.HttpStatusCodes

|patch |data, resourcePath, endpointHttpHeaders |PATCH |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.commons.HttpStatusCodes

|read |queryParams, resourcePath, endpointHttpHeaders |GET |Depends on OData resource being queried as described next

|update |data, resourcePath, endpointHttpHeaders |PUT |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.commons.HttpStatusCodes
|=======================================================================

== Endpoint HTTP Headers
The component level configuration property **httpHeaders** supplies static HTTP header information. 
However, some systems requires dynamic header information to be passed to and received from the endpoint.
A sample use case would be systems that require dynamic security tokens.  The **endpointHttpHeaders** 
and **responseHttpHeaders** endpoint properties provides this capability.  Set headers that need to 
be passed to the endpoint in the *`CamelOlingo2.endpointHttpHeaders`* property and the 
response headers will be returned in a *`CamelOlingo2.responseHttpHeaders`* property.  
Both properties are of the type *`java.util.Map<String, String>`*.

== OData Resource Type Mapping

The result of *read* endpoint and data type of *data* option depends on
the OData resource being queried, created or modified. 

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|OData Resource Type |Resource URI from resourcePath and keyPredicate |In or Out Body Type

|Entity data model |$metadata |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.edm.Edm

|Service document |/ |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.servicedocument.ServiceDocument

|OData feed |<entity-set> |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.ep.feed.ODataFeed

|OData entry |<entity-set>(<key-predicate>) |org.apache.olingo.odata2.api.ep.entry.ODataEntry for Out body (response)
java.util.Map<String, Object> for In body (request)

|Simple property |<entity-set>(<key-predicate>)/<simple-property> |Appropriate Java data type as described by Olingo EdmProperty

|Simple property value |<entity-set>(<key-predicate>)/<simple-property>/$value |Appropriate Java data type as described by Olingo EdmProperty

|Complex property |<entity-set>(<key-predicate>)/<complex-property> |java.util.Map<String, Object>

|Zero or one association link |<entity-set>(<key-predicate>/$link/<one-to-one-entity-set-property> |String for response
java.util.Map<String, Object> with key property names and values for request

|Zero or many association links |<entity-set>(<key-predicate>/$link/<one-to-many-entity-set-property> |java.util.List<String> for response
java.util.List<java.util.Map<String, Object>> containing list of key property names and values for request

|Count |<resource-uri>/$count |java.lang.Long
|=======================================================================

== Consumer Endpoints

Only the *read* endpoint can be used as a consumer endpoint. Consumer
endpoints can
use http://camel.apache.org/polling-consumer.html#PollingConsumer-ScheduledPollConsumerOptions[Scheduled
Poll Consumer Options] to schedule endpoint
invocation. By default consumer endpoints that return an array or
collection will generate one exchange per element, and their routes will
be executed once for each exchange. This behavior can be disabled by
setting the endpoint property *splitResult=false*.

== Message Headers

Any URI option can be provided in a message header for producer
endpoints with a *`CamelOlingo2.`* prefix.

== Message Body

All result message bodies utilize objects provided by the underlying
http://olingo.apache.org/javadoc/odata2/index.html[Apache Olingo 2.0
API] used by the Olingo2Component. Producer endpoints can specify the
option name for incoming message body in the *`inBody`* endpoint URI
parameter. For endpoints that return an array or collection, a consumer
endpoint will map every element to distinct messages, unless
*splitResult* is set to *false*.

== Use cases

The following route reads top 5 entries from the Manufacturer feed
ordered by ascending Name property. 

 

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:...")
    .setHeader("CamelOlingo2.$top", "5");
    .to("olingo2://read/Manufacturers?orderBy=Name%20asc");
------------------------------------------------------------

 

The following route reads Manufacturer entry using the key property
value in incoming *id* header. 

 

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:...")
    .setHeader("CamelOlingo2.keyPredicate", header("id"))
    .to("olingo2://read/Manufacturers");
------------------------------------------------------------

 

The following route creates Manufacturer entry using the
*java.util.Map<String, Object>* in body message. 

 

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:...")
    .to("olingo2://create/Manufacturers");
------------------------------------------------------------

 

The following route polls Manufacturer
http://olingo.apache.org/doc/tutorials/deltaClient.html[delta
feed] every 30 seconds. The bean *blah* updates the bean *paramsBean* to
add an updated *!deltatoken* property with the value returned in the
*ODataDeltaFeed* result. Since the initial delta token is not known, the
consumer endpoint will produce an *ODataFeed* value the first time, and
*ODataDeltaFeed* on subsequent polls. 

 

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("olingo2://read/Manufacturers?queryParams=#paramsBean&timeUnit=SECONDS&delay=30")
    .to("bean:blah");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
