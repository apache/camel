== MLLP Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.17*

The MLLP component is specifically designed to handle the nuances of the
MLLP protocol and provide the functionality required by Healthcare
providers to communicate with other systems using the MLLP protocol.
 The MLLP component  provides a simple configuration URI, automated HL7
acknowledgment generation and automatic acknowledgement interrogation.

The MLLP protocol does not typically use a large number of concurrent
TCP connections - a single active TCP connection is the normal case.
 Therefore, the MLLP component uses a simple thread-per-connection model
based an standard Java Sockets. This keeps the implementation simple
and eliminates the dependencies other than Camel itself.

The component supports the following:

* A Camel consumer using a TCP Server
* A Camel producer using a TCP Client

The MLLP component uses byte[] payloads, and relies on Camel Type
Conversion to convert byte[] to other types.  

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]

| *requireEndOfData* (common) | Enable/Disable strict compliance to the MLLP standard. The MLLP standard specifies START_OF_BLOCKhl7 payloadEND_OF_BLOCKEND_OF_DATA, however, some systems do not send the final END_OF_DATA byte. This setting controls whether or not the final END_OF_DATA byte is required or optional. | true | boolean
| *stringPayload* (common) | Enable/Disable converting the payload to a String. If enabled, HL7 Payloads received from external systems will be validated converted to a String. If the charsetName property is set, that character set will be used for the conversion. If the charsetName property is not set, the value of MSH-18 will be used to determine th appropriate character set. If MSH-18 is not set, then the default ISO-8859-1 character set will be use. | true | boolean
| *validatePayload* (common) | Enable/Disable the validation of HL7 Payloads If enabled, HL7 Payloads received from external systems will be validated (see Hl7Util.generateInvalidPayloadExceptionMessage for details on the validation). If and invalid payload is detected, a MllpInvalidMessageException (for consumers) or a MllpInvalidAcknowledgementException will be thrown. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to receive incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. If disabled, the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions by logging them at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | true | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler

=== MLLP Consumer

The MLLP Consumer supports receiving MLLP-framed messages and sending
HL7 Acknowledgements.  The MLLP Consumer can automatically generate the
HL7 Acknowledgement (HL7 Application Acknowledgements only - AA, AE and
AR), or the acknowledgement can be specified using
the CamelMllpAcknowledgement exchange property.  Additionally, the type
of acknowledgement that will be generated can be controlled by setting
the CamelMllpAcknowledgementType exchange property.

=== *Message Headers*

The MLLP Consumer adds these headers on the Camel message:

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",]
|===========================================
|*Key* |*Description* |
|CamelMllpLocalAddress | The local TCP Address of the Socket |
|CamelMllpRemoteAddress | The local TCP Address of the Socket |
|CamelMllpSendingApplication | MSH-3 value |
|CamelMllpSendingFacility | MSH-4 value |
|CamelMllpReceivingApplication | MSH-5 value |
|CamelMllpReceivingFacility | MSH-6 value |
|CamelMllpTimestamp | MSH-7 value |
|CamelMllpSecurity | MSH-8 value |
|CamelMllpMessageType | MSH-9 value |
|CamelMllpEventType | MSH-9-1 value |
|CamelMllpTriggerEvent | MSH-9-2 value |
|CamelMllpMessageControlId | MSH-10 value |
|CamelMllpProcessingId | MSH-11 value |
|CamelMllpVersionId | MSH-12 value |
|CamelMllpCharset | MSH-18 value |
|===========================================

All headers are String types. If a header value is missing, its value
is null.

=== *Exchange Properties*

The type of acknowledgment the MLLP Consumer generates and state of the TCP Socket can be controlled
by these properties on the Camel exchange:

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",]
|====================================
|*Key* |*Type* |*Description*
|CamelMllpAcknowledgement | byte[] | If present, this property will we sent to client as the MLLP Acknowledgement
|CamelMllpAcknowledgementString | String | If present and CamelMllpAcknowledgement is not present, this property will we sent to client as the MLLP Acknowledgement
|CamelMllpAcknowledgementMsaText | String | If neither CamelMllpAcknowledgement or CamelMllpAcknowledgementString are present and autoAck is true, this property can be used to specify the contents of MSA-3 in the generated HL7 acknowledgement
|CamelMllpAcknowledgementType | String  | If neither CamelMllpAcknowledgement or CamelMllpAcknowledgementString are present and autoAck is true, this property can be used to specify the HL7 acknowledgement type (i.e. AA, AE, AR)
|CamelMllpAutoAcknowledge | Boolean | Overrides the autoAck query parameter

|CamelMllpCloseConnectionBeforeSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed before sending data
|CamelMllpResetConnectionBeforeSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset before sending data
|CamelMllpCloseConnectionAfterSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed immediately after sending data
|CamelMllpResetConnectionAfterSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset immediately after sending any data
|====================================

// REVISIT - Empty section is bad for AsciiDoc build
//=== Consumer Configuration

=== MLLP Producer

The MLLP Producer supports sending MLLP-framed messages and receiving
HL7 Acknowledgements.  The MLLP Producer interrogates the HL7
Acknowledgments and raises exceptions if a negative acknowledgement is
received.  The received acknowledgement is interrogated and an exception
is raised in the event of a negative acknowledgement.

=== *Message Headers*

The MLLP Producer adds these headers on the Camel message:

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",]
|===================================
|*Key* |*Description* |
|CamelMllpLocalAddress | The local TCP Address of the Socket | 
|CamelMllpRemoteAddress | The remote TCP Address of the Socket | 
|CamelMllpAcknowledgement | The HL7 Acknowledgment byte[] received | 
|CamelMllpAcknowledgementString | The HL7 Acknowledgment received, converted to a String | 
|CamelMllpAcknowledgementType | The HL7 acknowledgement type (AA, AE, AR, etc)
|===================================

=== *Exchange Properties*

The state of the TCP Socket can be controlled by these properties on the Camel exchange:

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",]
|====================================
|*Key* |*Type* |*Description*
|CamelMllpCloseConnectionBeforeSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed before sending data
|CamelMllpResetConnectionBeforeSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset before sending data
|CamelMllpCloseConnectionAfterSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be closed immediately after sending data
|CamelMllpResetConnectionAfterSend | Boolean | If true, the Socket will be reset immediately after sending any data
|====================================
