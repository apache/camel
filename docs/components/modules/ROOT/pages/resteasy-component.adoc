=== Options

// component options: START
The Resteasy component supports 22 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *httpRegistry* (common) | Sets httpRegistry which can be externalized to be used by camel |  | HttpRegistry
| *proxyConsumersClasses* (common) | Sets the proxy class for consumer enpoints |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *cookieStore* (producer) | To use a custom org.apache.http.client.CookieStore. By default the org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicCookieStore is used which is an in-memory only cookie store. Notice if bridgeEndpoint=true then the cookie store is forced to be a noop cookie store as cookie shouldn't be stored as we are just bridging (eg acting as a proxy). |  | CookieStore
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *allowJavaSerializedObject* (advanced) | Whether to allow java serialization when a request uses context-type=application/x-java-serialized-object. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *clientConnectionManager* (advanced) | To use a custom and shared HttpClientConnectionManager to manage connections. If this has been configured then this is always used for all endpoints created by this component. |  | HttpClientConnectionManager
| *connectionsPerRoute* (advanced) | The maximum number of connections per route. | 20 | int
| *connectionTimeToLive* (advanced) | The time for connection to live, the time unit is millisecond, the default value is always keep alive. |  | long
| *httpBinding* (advanced) | To use a custom HttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and HttpClient. |  | HttpBinding
| *httpClientConfigurer* (advanced) | To use the custom HttpClientConfigurer to perform configuration of the HttpClient that will be used. |  | HttpClientConfigurer
| *httpConfiguration* (advanced) | To use the shared HttpConfiguration as base configuration. |  | HttpConfiguration
| *httpContext* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.http.protocol.HttpContext when executing requests. |  | HttpContext
| *maxTotalConnections* (advanced) | The maximum number of connections. | 200 | int
| *headerFilterStrategy* (filter) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters. Important: Only one instance of org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters is supported per HttpComponent. If you need to use 2 or more different instances, you need to define a new HttpComponent per instance you need. |  | SSLContextParameters
| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean
| *x509HostnameVerifier* (security) | To use a custom X509HostnameVerifier such as DefaultHostnameVerifier or NoopHostnameVerifier. |  | HostnameVerifier
| *connectionRequestTimeout* (timeout) | The timeout in milliseconds used when requesting a connection from the connection manager. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default). | -1 | int
| *connectTimeout* (timeout) | Determines the timeout in milliseconds until a connection is established. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default). | -1 | int
| *socketTimeout* (timeout) | Defines the socket timeout in milliseconds, which is the timeout for waiting for data or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets). A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default). | -1 | int

// endpoint options: START
The Resteasy endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
resteasy:contextPath
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *httpUri* | *Required* The url of the HTTP endpoint to call. |  | URI
|===


=== Query Parameters (73 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basicAuth* (common) | Sets the flag to basicAuth on endpoint |  | Boolean
| *chunked* (common) | If this option is false the Servlet will disable the HTTP streaming and set the content-length header on the response | true | boolean
| *disableStreamCache* (common) | Determines whether or not the raw input stream from Servlet is cached or not (Camel will read the stream into a in memory/overflow to file, Stream caching) cache. By default Camel will cache the Servlet input stream to support reading it multiple times to ensure it Camel can retrieve all data from the stream. However you can set this option to true when you for example need to access the raw stream, such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. DefaultHttpBinding will copy the request input stream into a stream cache and put it into message body if this option is false to support reading the stream multiple times. If you use Servlet to bridge/proxy an endpoint then consider enabling this option to improve performance, in case you do not need to read the message payload multiple times. The http producer will by default cache the response body stream. If setting this option to true, then the producers will not cache the response body stream but use the response stream as-is as the message body. | false | boolean
| *headerFilterStrategy* (common) | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *password* (common) | Sets the password |  | String
| *proxyClientClass* (common) | Sets the resteasy proxyClientClass |  | String
| *proxyMethod* (common) | Sets the proxy method defined in an interface |  | String
| *restEasyHttpBindingRef* (common) | Sets the restEasyHttpBinding if you have a customised one registered in the context |  | ResteasyHttpBinding
| *resteasyMethod* (common) | Sets the resteasy method to process the request |  | String
| *servletName* (common) | Sets the servlet name |  | String
| *setHttpResponseDuring Processing* (common) | Sets the flag to use the endpoint where you can either populate camel exchange from servlet response or use request itself which may be thought as if it is a proxy. |  | Boolean
| *skipServletProcessing* (common) | Sets the flag to use skip servlet processing and let camel take over processing |  | Boolean
| *throwExceptionOnFailure* (common) | ets the flag to propogate the exception | false | boolean
| *transferException* (common) | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side, and if the caused Exception was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is, instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | boolean

| *httpBinding* (common) | To use a custom HttpBinding to control the mapping between Camel message and HttpClient. |  | HttpBinding
| *async* (consumer) | Configure the consumer to work in async mode | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *httpMethodRestrict* (consumer) | Used to only allow consuming if the HttpMethod matches, such as GET/POST/PUT etc. Multiple methods can be specified separated by comma. |  | String

| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *optionsEnabled* (consumer) | Specifies whether to enable HTTP OPTIONS for this Servlet consumer. By default OPTIONS is turned off. | false | boolean

| *httpMethod* (producer) | Configure the HTTP method to use. The HttpMethod header cannot override this option if set. The value can be one of: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH |  | HttpMethods
| *ignoreResponseBody* (producer) | If this option is true, The http producer won't read response body and cache the input stream | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *preserveHostHeader* (producer) | If the option is true, HttpProducer will set the Host header to the value contained in the current exchange Host header, useful in reverse proxy applications where you want the Host header received by the downstream server to reflect the URL called by the upstream client, this allows applications which use the Host header to generate accurate URL's for a proxied service | false | boolean
