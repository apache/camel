//THIS FILE IS COPIED: EDIT THE SOURCE FILE:

:docTitle: Jing
:artifactId: camel-jing
:description: Validate XML against a RelaxNG schema (XML Syntax or Compact Syntax) using Jing library.
:since: 1.1
:supportLevel: Stable
:component-header: Only producer is supported
include::{cq-version}@camel-quarkus:ROOT:partial$reference/components/jing.adoc[opts=optional]

*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Jing component uses the
http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html[Jing Library] to perform
XML validation of the message body using either

* http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax]
* http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html[RelaxNG Compact
Syntax]

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jing</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the xref:msv-component.adoc[MSV] component can also support RelaxNG XML
syntax.

== URI format

[source,text]
------------------------------
jing:someLocalOrRemoteResource
------------------------------

The component uses jing as name, and you can use the
option compactSyntax to turn on either RNG or RNC mode.

== Options


// component options: START
The Jing component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The Jing endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
jing:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* URL to a local resource on the classpath or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file system which contains the schema to validate against. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *compactSyntax* (producer) | Whether to validate using RelaxNG compact syntax or not. By default this is false for using RelaxNG XML Syntax (rng) And true is for using RelaxNG Compact Syntax (rnc) | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END




== Example

The following example shows how to configure a route from the endpoint *direct:start* which
then goes to one of two endpoints, either *mock:valid* or *mock:invalid*
based on whether or not the XML matches the given
http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html[RelaxNG Compact Syntax]
schema (which is supplied on the classpath).
