= JCR Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.3*

The JCR component allows you to add/read nodes to/from a JCR
compliant content repository (for example,
http://jackrabbit.apache.org/[Apache Jackrabbit]) with its producer, or
register an EventListener with the consumer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jcr</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------
jcr://user:password@repository/path/to/node
-------------------------------------------

*Consumer added*

You can use consumer as an EventListener in
JCR or a producer to read a node by identifier.

== Usage

The `repository` element of the URI is used to look up the JCR
`Repository` object in the Camel context registry.

=== JCR Options


// component options: START
The JCR component supports 1 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The JCR endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
jcr:host/base
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* | *Required* Name of the javax.jcr.Repository to lookup from the Camel registry to be used. |  | String
| *base* | Get the base node when accessing the repository |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (16 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *deep* (common) | When isDeep is true, events whose associated parent node is at absPath or within its subgraph are received. | false | boolean
| *eventTypes* (common) | eventTypes (a combination of one or more event types encoded as a bit mask value such as javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_ADDED, javax.jcr.observation.Event.NODE_REMOVED, etc.). |  | int
| *nodeTypeNames* (common) | When a comma separated nodeTypeName list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the node types (or a subtype of one of the node types) in this list will be received. |  | String
| *noLocal* (common) | If noLocal is true, then events generated by the session through which the listener was registered are ignored. Otherwise, they are not ignored. | false | boolean
| *password* (common) | Password for login |  | String
| *sessionLiveCheckInterval* (common) | Interval in milliseconds to wait before each session live checking The default value is 60000 ms. | 60000 | long
| *sessionLiveCheckIntervalOn Start* (common) | Interval in milliseconds to wait before the first session live checking. The default value is 3000 ms. | 3000 | long
| *username* (common) | Username for login |  | String
| *uuids* (common) | When a comma separated uuid list string is set, only events whose associated parent node has one of the identifiers in the comma separated uuid list will be received. |  | String
| *workspaceName* (common) | The workspace to access. If it's not specified then the default one will be used |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-jcr-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.jcr.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.jcr.enabled* | Enable jcr component | true | Boolean
|===
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: END

== Example

The snippet below creates a node named `node` under the `/home/test`
node in the content repository. One additional property is added to the
node as well: `my.contents.property` which will contain the body of the
message being sent.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:a").setHeader(JcrConstants.JCR_NODE_NAME, constant("node"))
    .setHeader("my.contents.property", body())
    .to("jcr://user:pass@repository/home/test");
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

The following code will register an EventListener under the path
import-application/inbox for Event.NODE_ADDED and Event.NODE_REMOVED
events (event types 1 and 2, both masked as 3) and listening deep for
all the children.

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
    <from uri="jcr://user:pass@repository/import-application/inbox?eventTypes=3&deep=true" />
    <to uri="direct:execute-import-application" />
</route>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
