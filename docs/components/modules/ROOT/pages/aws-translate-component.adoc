*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Translate component supports translate a text in multiple languages.
https://aws.amazon.com/translate/[AWS Translate] clusters instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Translate. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/translate/[Amazon Translate].

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws-translate://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Translate component supports 15 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoDiscoverClient* (common) | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *autodetectSourceLanguage* (producer) | Being able to autodetect the source language | false | boolean
| *configuration* (producer) | The component configuration |  | TranslateConfiguration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. There are 1 enums and the value can be one of: translateText | translateText | TranslateOperations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Translate client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Translate client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Translate client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which Translate client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *secretKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *sourceLanguage* (producer) | Source language to use |  | String
| *targetLanguage* (producer) | Target language to use |  | String
| *translateClient* (producer) | To use a existing configured AWS Translate as client |  | AmazonTranslate
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The AWS Translate endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-translate:label
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

// endpoint options: END




Required Translate component options

You have to provide the amazonTranslateClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/translate/[Amazon Translate] service.

== Usage

=== Message headers evaluated by the Translate producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsTranslateSourceLanguage` |`String` |The text source language

|`CamelAwsTranslateTargetLanguage` |`String` |The text target language

|`CamelAwsTranslateTerminologyNames` |`String` |The terminologies to use

|`CamelAwsTranslateOperation` |`String` |The operation to perform
|=======================================================================

=== Translate Producer operations

Camel-AWS Translate component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- translateText

== Automatic detection of AmazonTranslate client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonTranslate bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Translate Text example

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .setHeader(TranslateConstants.SOURCE_LANGUAGE, TranslateLanguageEnum.ITALIAN)
  .setHeader(TranslateConstants.TARGET_LANGUAGE, TranslateLanguageEnum.GERMAN)
  .setBody("Ciao")
  .to("aws-translate://test?translateClient=#amazonTranslateClient&operation=translateText");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As result you'll get an exchange containing the translated text.

Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-translate</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
