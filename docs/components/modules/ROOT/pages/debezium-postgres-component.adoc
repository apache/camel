*Since Camel 3.0*


*Since Camel 3.0*

The Debezium PostgresSQL component is wrapper around https://debezium.io/[Debezium] using https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html[Debezium Embedded], which enables Change Data Capture from PostgresSQL database using Debezium without the need for Kafka or Kafka Connect.

*Note on handling failures:* Per https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html#_handling_failures[Debezium Embedded Engine] documentation, the engines is actively recording source offsets and periodically flushes these offsets to a persistent storage, so when the application is restarted or crashed, the engine will resume from the last recorded offset.
Thus, at normal operation, your downstream routes will receive each event exactly once, however in case of an application crash (not having a graceful shutdown), the application will resume from the last recorded offset,
which may result in receiving duplicate events immediately after the restart. Therefore, your downstream routes should be tolerant enough of such case and deduplicate events if needed.

*Note:* The Debezium PostgresSQL component is currently not supported in OSGi

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component.

| *snapshotSelectStatement Overrides* (postgres) | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String

| *toastedValuePlaceholder* (postgres) | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database.If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | __debezium_unavailable_value | String
| *tombstonesOnDelete* (postgres) | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | boolean
| *xminFetchIntervalMs* (postgres) | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. | 0 | long

| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.snapshot-lock-timeout-ms* | The maximum number of millis to wait for table locks at the beginning of a snapshot. If locks cannot be acquired in this time frame, the snapshot will be aborted. Defaults to 10 seconds | 10000 | Long
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.snapshot-mode* | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'always' to specify that the connector run a snapshot each time it starts up; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally start emitting changes;'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the last position (LSN) recorded by the server; and'exported' to specify the connector should run a snapshot based on the position when the replication slot was created; 'custom' to specify a custom class with 'snapshot.custom_class' which will be loaded and used to determine the snapshot, see docs for more details. | initial | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.snapshot-select-statement-overrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.[DB_NAME].[TABLE_NAME]' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.[SCHEMA_NAME].[TABLE_NAME]', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.source-struct-version* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.status-update-interval-ms* | Frequency in milliseconds for sending replication connection status updates to the server. Defaults to 10 seconds (10000 ms). | 10000 | Integer
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.table-blacklist* | Description is not available here, please check Debezium website for corresponding key 'table.blacklist' description. |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.table-whitelist* | The tables for which changes are to be captured |  | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.time-precision-mode* | Time, date, and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive' (the default) bases the precision of time, date, and timestamp values on the database column's precision; 'adaptive_time_microseconds' like 'adaptive' mode, but TIME fields always use microseconds precision;'connect' always represents time, date, and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision . | adaptive | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.toasted-value-placeholder* | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database.If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | __debezium_unavailable_value | String
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.tombstones-on-delete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.configuration.xmin-fetch-interval-ms* | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. | 0 | Long
| *camel.component.debezium-postgres.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the debezium-postgres component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean

== Message headers

=== Consumer headers

The following headers are available when consuming change events from Debezium.
[width="100%",cols="2m,2m,1m,5",options="header"]
|===
| Header constant                           | Header value                                   | Type        | Description
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_IDENTIFIER       | "CamelDebeziumIdentifier"                      | String      | The identifier of the connector, normally is this format "{server-name}.{database-name}.{table-name}".
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_KEY              | "CamelDebeziumKey"                             | Struct      | The key of the event, normally is the table Primary Key.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_SOURCE_METADATA  | "CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata"                  | Map         | The metadata about the source event, for example `table` name, database `name`, log position, etc, please refer to the Debezium documentation for more info.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_OPERATION        | "CamelDebeziumOperation"                       | String      | If presents, the type of event operation. Values for the connector are `c` for create (or insert), `u` for update, `d` for delete or `r` in case of a snapshot event.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_TIMESTAMP        | "CamelDebeziumTimestamp"                       | Long        | If presents, the time (using the system clock in the JVM) at which the connector processed the event.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_BEFORE           | "CamelDebeziumBefore"                          | Struct     | If presents, contains the state of the row before the event occurred.
|===

== Message body
The message body if is not `null` (in case of tombstones), it contains the state of the row after the event occurred as `Struct` format or `Map` format if you use the included Type Converter from `Struct` to `Map` (please look below for more explanation).

== Samples

=== Consuming events

Here is a very simple route that you can use in order to listen to Debezium events from PostgresSQL connector.
[source,java]
----
from("debezium-postgres:dbz-test-1?offsetStorageFileName=/usr/offset-file-1.dat&databaseHostName=localhost&databaseUser=debezium&databasePassword=dbz&databaseServerName=my-app-connector&databaseHistoryFileName=/usr/history-file-1.dat")
    .log("Event received from Debezium : ${body}")
    .log("    with this identifier ${headers.CamelDebeziumIdentifier}")
    .log("    with these source metadata ${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata}")
    .log("    the event occured upon this operation '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceOperation}'")
    .log("    on this database '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[db]}' and this table '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[table]}'")
    .log("    with the key ${headers.CamelDebeziumKey}")
    .log("    the previous value is ${headers.CamelDebeziumBefore}")
----

By default, the component will emit the events in the body and `CamelDebeziumBefore` header as https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html[`Struct`] data type, the reasoning behind this, is to perceive the schema information in case is needed.
However, the component as well contains a xref:manual::type-converter.adoc[Type Converter] that converts
from default output type of https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html[`Struct`] to `Map` in order to leverage Camel's rich xref:manual::data-format.adoc[Data Format] types which many of them work out of box with `Map` data type.
To use it, you can either add `Map.class` type when you access the message e.g: `exchange.getIn().getBody(Map.class)`, or you can convert the body always to `Map` from the route builder by adding `.convertBodyTo(Map.class)` to your Camel Route DSL after `from` statement.

We mentioned above about the schema, which can be used in case you need to perform advance data transformation and the schema is needed for that. If you choose not to convert your body to `Map`,
you can obtain the schema information as https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Schema.html[`Schema`] type from `Struct` like this:
[source,java]
----
from("debezium-postgres:[name]?[options]])
    .process(exchange -> {
        final Struct bodyValue = exchange.getIn().getBody(Struct.class);
        final Schema schemaValue = bodyValue.schema();

        log.info("Body value is :" + bodyValue);
        log.info("With Schema : " + schemaValue);
        log.info("And fields of :" + schemaValue.fields());
        log.info("Field name has `" + schemaValue.field("name").schema() + "` type");
    });
----

*Important Note:* This component is a thin wrapper around Debezium Engine as mentioned, therefore before using this component in production, you need to understand how Debezium works and how configurations can reflect the expected behavior, especially in regards to https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html#_handling_failures[handling failures].
