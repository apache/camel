*Since Camel 2.21*



The ElasticSearch component allows you to interface with an
https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[ElasticSearch] 6.x API using the REST Client library.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-elasticsearch-rest</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== Endpoint Options

// component options: START
The Elastichsearch Rest component supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *client* (advanced) | To use an existing configured Elasticsearch client, instead of creating a client per endpoint. This allow to customize the client with specific settings. |  | RestClient
| *connectionTimeout* (advanced) | The time in ms to wait before connection will timeout. | 30000 | int
| *enableSniffer* (advanced) | Enable automatically discover nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster | false | Boolean
| *hostAddresses* (advanced) | Comma separated list with ip:port formatted remote transport addresses to use. The ip and port options must be left blank for hostAddresses to be considered instead. |  | String
| *maxRetryTimeout* (advanced) | The time in ms before retry | 30000 | int
| *sniffAfterFailureDelay* (advanced) | The delay of a sniff execution scheduled after a failure (in milliseconds) | 60000 | int
| *snifferInterval* (advanced) | The interval between consecutive ordinary sniff executions in milliseconds. Will be honoured when sniffOnFailure is disabled or when there are no failures between consecutive sniff executions | 300000 | int
| *socketTimeout* (advanced) | The timeout in ms to wait before the socket will timeout. | 30000 | int
| *enableSSL* (security) | Enable SSL | false | Boolean
| *password* (security) | Password for authenticate |  | String
| *user* (security) | Basic authenticate user |  | String

== Message Operations

The following ElasticSearch operations are currently supported. Simply
set an endpoint URI option or exchange header with a key of "operation"
and a value set to one of the following. Some operations also require
other parameters or the message body to be set.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|operation |message body |description

|Index |*Map*, *String*, *byte[]*, *XContentBuilder* or *IndexRequest* content to index |Adds content to an index and returns the content's indexId in the body.
You can set the indexId by setting the message header with
the key "indexId".

|GetById |*String* or *GetRequest* index id of content to retrieve |Retrieves the specified index and returns a GetResult object in the body

|Delete |*String* or *DeleteRequest* index name and type of content to delete |Deletes the specified indexName and indexType and returns a DeleteResponse object in the
body

|DeleteIndex |*String* or *DeleteRequest* index name of the index to delete |Deletes the specified indexName and returns a status code the
body

|BulkIndex | a *List*, *BulkRequest*, or *Collection* of any type that is already accepted
(XContentBuilder, Map, byte[], String) |Adds content to an index and return a List of the id of the
successfully indexed documents in the body

|Bulk |a *List*, *BulkRequest*, or *Collection* of any type that is already accepted
       (XContentBuilder, Map, byte[], String) |Adds content to an index and returns the BulkItemResponse[]
object in the body

|Search |*Map*, *String* or *SearchRequest* |Search the content with the map of query string

|MultiSearch |*MultiSearchRequest* |Multiple search in one

|Exists |Index name(indexName) as header  |Checks the index exists or not and returns a Boolean flag in the body

|Update |*Map*, *UpdateRequest*, *String*, *byte[]* or *XContentBuilder* content to update |Updates content to an index and returns the content's
indexId in the body.

|Ping |None  |Pings the remote Elasticsearch cluster and returns true if the ping succeeded, false otherwise

== Configure the component and enable basic authentication
To use the Elasticsearch component it has to be configured with a minimum configuration.

[source,java]
----
ElasticsearchComponent elasticsearchComponent = new ElasticsearchComponent();
elasticsearchComponent.setHostAddresses("myelkhost:9200");
camelContext.addComponent("elasticsearch-rest", elasticsearchComponent);
----

For basic authentication with elasticsearch or using reverse http proxy in front of the elasticsearch cluster, simply setup
basic authentication and SSL on the component like the example below

[source,java]
----
ElasticsearchComponent elasticsearchComponent = new ElasticsearchComponent();
elasticsearchComponent.setHostAddresses("myelkhost:9200");
elasticsearchComponent.setUser("elkuser");
elasticsearchComponent.setPassword("secure!!");
elasticsearchComponent.setEnableSSL(true);

camelContext.addComponent("elasticsearch-rest", elasticsearchComponent);
----

== Index Example

Below is a simple INDEX example

[source,java]
----
from("direct:index")
  .to("elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=Index&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet");
----

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:index" />
    <to uri="elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=Index&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet"/>
</route>
----

*For this operation you'll need to specify a indexId header.*

A client would simply need to pass a body message containing a Map to
the route. The result body contains the indexId created.

[source,java]
----
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
map.put("content", "test");
String indexId = template.requestBody("direct:index", map, String.class);
----

== Search Example

Searching on specific field(s) and value use the Operation ´Search´.
Pass in the query JSON String or the Map

[source,java]
----
from("direct:search")
  .to("elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=Search&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet");
----

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:search" />
    <to uri="elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=Search&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet"/>
</route>
----

[source,java]
----
String query = "{\"query\":{\"match\":{\"content\":\"new release of ApacheCamel\"}}}";
SearchHits response = template.requestBody("direct:search", query, SearchHits.class);

----

Search on specific field(s) using Map.

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> actualQuery = new HashMap<>();
actualQuery.put("content", "new release of ApacheCamel");

Map<String, Object> match = new HashMap<>();
match.put("match", actualQuery);

Map<String, Object> query = new HashMap<>();
query.put("query", match);
SearchHits response = template.requestBody("direct:search", query, SearchHits.class);

----

Search using Elasticsearch scroll api in order to fetch all results.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:search")
  .to("elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=Search&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet&useScroll=true&scrollKeepAliveMs=30000");
----

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:search" />
    <to uri="elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=Search&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet&useScroll=true&scrollKeepAliveMs=30000"/>
</route>
----

[source,java]
----
String query = "{\"query\":{\"match\":{\"content\":\"new release of ApacheCamel\"}}}";
try (ElasticsearchScrollRequestIterator response = template.requestBody("direct:search", query, ElasticsearchScrollRequestIterator.class)) {
    // do something smart with results
}
----

xref:{eip-vc}:eips:split-eip.adoc[Split EIP] can also be used.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:search")
  .to("elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=Search&indexName=twitter&indexType=tweet&useScroll=true&scrollKeepAliveMs=30000")
  .split()
  .body()
  .streaming()
  .to("mock:output")
  .end();
----

== MultiSearch Example

MultiSearching on specific field(s) and value use the Operation ´MultiSearch´.
Pass in the MultiSearchRequest instance

[source,java]
----
from("direct:multiSearch")
  .to("elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=MultiSearch");
----

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:multiSearch" />
    <to uri="elasticsearch-rest://elasticsearch?operation=MultiSearch"/>
</route>
----

MultiSearch on specific field(s) 

[source,java]
----
SearchRequest req = new SearchRequest();
req.indices("twitter");
req.types("tweet");
SearchRequest req1 = new SearchRequest();
req.indices("twitter");
req.types("tweets");
MultiSearchRequest request = new MultiSearchRequest().add(req1).add(req);
Item[] response = template.requestBody("direct:search", request, Item[].class);
