*Since Camel 2.22*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The AS2 component provides transport of EDI messages using the HTTP transfer protocol
as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4130[RFC4130]. 

[NOTE]
====
This component is currently a work in progress. Expect URI options and path and query parameters to change in future versions of this component.
==== 

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-as2</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== URI format

[source]
----
as2://apiName/methodName
----

apiName can be one of:

* client
* server


== AS2 Options


// component options: START
The AS2 component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (common) | To use the shared configuration |  | AS2Configuration
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

== Client Endpoints:

Client endpoints use the endpoint prefix *`client`* followed by the name of a method
and associated options described next. The endpoint URI MUST contain the prefix *`client`*.

[source]
----
as2://client/method?[options]
----

Endpoint options that are not mandatory are denoted by *[]*. When there
are no mandatory options for an endpoint, one of the set of *[]* options
MUST be provided. Producer endpoints can also use a special
option *`inBody`* that in turn should contain the name of the endpoint
option whose value will be contained in the Camel Exchange In message.

Any of the endpoint options can be provided in either the endpoint URI,
or dynamically in a message header. The message header name must be of
the format *`CamelAS2.<option>`*. Note that the *`inBody`* option
overrides message header, i.e. the endpoint
option *`inBody=option`* would override a *`CamelAS2.option`* header.

If a value is not provided for the option *defaultRequest* either in the
endpoint URI or in a message header, it will be assumed to be `null`.
Note that the `null` value will only be used if other options do not
satisfy matching endpoints.

In case of AS2 API errors the endpoint will throw a
RuntimeCamelException with a
*org.apache.http.HttpException* derived exception
cause.

== Server Endpoints:

Server endpoints use the endpoint prefix *`server`* followed by the name of a method
and associated options described next. The endpoint URI MUST contain the prefix *`server`*.

Endpoint options that are not mandatory are denoted by *[]*. When there

satisfy matching endpoints.

RuntimeCamelException with a
*org.apache.http.HttpException* derived exception
cause.
