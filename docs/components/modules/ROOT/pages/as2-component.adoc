*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AS2 component provides transport of EDI messages using the HTTP transfer protocol
as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4130[RFC4130]. 

[NOTE]
====
This component is currently a work in progress. Expect URI options and path and query parameters to change in future versions of this component.
==== 

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-as2</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== AS2 Options


// component options: START
The AS2 component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Component configuration |  | AS2Configuration
|===

=== API Parameters (2 APIs):

The AS2 endpoint is an API based component and has additional parameters based on which API name and API method is used.
The API name and API method is located in the endpoint URI as the apiName/methodName path parameters:

----
as2:apiName/methodName

In addition to the parameters above, the client API can also use from the 31 endpoint query option
which is listed in the _Query Parameters_ section.

Any of the parameters can be provided in either the endpoint URI, or dynamically in a message header.
The message header name must be of the format `CamelAs2.parameter`.
The `inBody` parameter overrides message header, i.e. the endpoint parameter `inBody=myParameterNameHere`
would override a `CamelAs2.myParameterNameHere` header.

*Only consumer is supported*




The server API has 1 method(s) which is represented by the following method signatures
(an API method may have multiple signatures due to overloading):

[source,java]

----

The server API is defined in the syntax as follows:

----
as2:server/methodName?[parameters]
