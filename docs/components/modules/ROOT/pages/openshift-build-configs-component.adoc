*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The OpenShift Build Config component is one of xref:kubernetes-summary.adoc[Kubernetes Components] which
provides a producer to execute Openshift Build Configs operations. 


== Component Options

// component options: START
The Openshift Build Config component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

== Endpoint Options

// endpoint options: START
The Openshift Build Config endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
openshift-build-configs:masterUrl
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *masterUrl* | *Required* Kubernetes Master url |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (21 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apiVersion* (producer) | The Kubernetes API Version to use |  | String
| *dnsDomain* (producer) | The dns domain, used for ServiceCall EIP |  | String
| *kubernetesClient* (producer) | Default KubernetesClient to use if provided |  | KubernetesClient
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | Producer operation to do on Kubernetes |  | String
| *portName* (producer) | The port name, used for ServiceCall EIP |  | String
| *portProtocol* (producer) | The port protocol, used for ServiceCall EIP | tcp | String
| *connectionTimeout* (advanced) | Connection timeout in milliseconds to use when making requests to the Kubernetes API server. |  | Integer
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *caCertData* (security) | The CA Cert Data |  | String
| *caCertFile* (security) | The CA Cert File |  | String
| *clientCertData* (security) | The Client Cert Data |  | String
| *clientCertFile* (security) | The Client Cert File |  | String
| *clientKeyAlgo* (security) | The Key Algorithm used by the client |  | String
| *clientKeyData* (security) | The Client Key data |  | String
| *clientKeyFile* (security) | The Client Key file |  | String
| *clientKeyPassphrase* (security) | The Client Key Passphrase |  | String
| *oauthToken* (security) | The Auth Token |  | String
| *password* (security) | Password to connect to Kubernetes |  | String
| *trustCerts* (security) | Define if the certs we used are trusted anyway or not |  | Boolean
| *username* (security) | Username to connect to Kubernetes |  | String

== Supported producer operation

- listBuildConfigs
- listBuildConfigsByLabels
- getBuildConfig

== Openshift Build Configs Producer Examples

- listBuilds: this operation list the Build Configs on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:list").
    toF("openshift-build-configs:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuildConfigs").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Builds from your Openshift cluster

- listBuildsByLabels: this operation list the build configs by labels on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listByLabels").process(new Processor() {

            @Override
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                Map<String, String> labels = new HashMap<>();
                labels.put("key1", "value1");
                labels.put("key2", "value2");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_BUILD_CONFIGS_LABELS, labels);
            }
        });
    toF("openshift-build-configs:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuildConfigsByLabels").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Build configs from your cluster, using a label selector (with key1 and key2, with value value1 and value2)
