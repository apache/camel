= Class Component
:page-source: components/camel-bean/src/main/docs/class-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.4*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Class component binds beans to Camel message exchanges. It works
in the same way as the xref:bean-component.adoc[Bean] component but instead of
looking up beans from a Registry it creates the bean
based on the class name.

== URI format

[source]
----
class:className[?options]
----

Where *className* is the fully qualified class name to create and use as
bean.

== Options


// component options: START
The Class component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *cache* (producer) | *Deprecated* Use singleton option instead. | true | Boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *scope* (producer) | Scope of bean. When using singleton scope (default) the bean is created or looked up only once and reused for the lifetime of the endpoint. The bean should be thread-safe in case concurrent threads is calling the bean at the same time. When using request scope the bean is created or looked up once per request (exchange). This can be used if you want to store state on a bean while processing a request and you want to call the same bean instance multiple times while processing the request. The bean does not have to be thread-safe as the instance is only called from the same request. When using delegate scope, then the bean will be looked up or created per call. However in case of lookup then this is delegated to the bean registry such as Spring or CDI (if in use), which depends on their configuration can act as either singleton or prototype scope. so when using prototype then this depends on the delegated registry. The value can be one of: Singleton, Request, Prototype | Singleton | BeanScope
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Class endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
class:beanName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *beanName* | *Required* Sets the name of the bean to invoke |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (7 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *cache* (common) | *Deprecated* Use scope option instead. |  | Boolean
| *method* (common) | Sets the name of the method to invoke on the bean |  | String
| *scope* (common) | Scope of bean. When using singleton scope (default) the bean is created or looked up only once and reused for the lifetime of the endpoint. The bean should be thread-safe in case concurrent threads is calling the bean at the same time. When using request scope the bean is created or looked up once per request (exchange). This can be used if you want to store state on a bean while processing a request and you want to call the same bean instance multiple times while processing the request. The bean does not have to be thread-safe as the instance is only called from the same request. When using prototype scope, then the bean will be looked up or created per call.

The value can be one of: Singleton, Request, Prototype | Singleton | BeanScope
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers.

| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *parameters* (advanced) | Used for configuring additional properties on the bean |  | Map
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Using

You simply use the *class* component just as the xref:bean-component.adoc[Bean]
component but by specifying the fully qualified classname instead. +
 For example to use the `MyFooBean` you have to do as follows:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    from("direct:start").to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyFooBean").to("mock:result");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also specify which method to invoke on the `MyFooBean`, for
example `hello`:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    from("direct:start").to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyFooBean?method=hello").to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Setting properties on the created instance

In the endpoint uri you can specify properties to set on the created
instance, for example if it has a `setPrefix` method:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   from("direct:start")
        .to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyPrefixBean?bean.prefix=Bye")
        .to("mock:result");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And you can also use the `#` syntax to refer to properties to be looked
up in the Registry.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    from("direct:start")
        .to("class:org.apache.camel.component.bean.MyPrefixBean?bean.cool=#foo")
        .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which will lookup a bean from the Registry with the
id `foo` and invoke the `setCool` method on the created instance of the
`MyPrefixBean` class.

[TIP]
====
See more details at the xref:bean-component.adoc[Bean] component as the *class*
component works in much the same way.
