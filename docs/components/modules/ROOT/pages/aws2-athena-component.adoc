*Since Camel 3.4*


*{component-header}*

The S3 component supports storing and retrieving objects from/to
https://aws.amazon.com/athena[Amazon's S3] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon S3. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon S3].

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws2-s3://bucketNameOrArn[?options]
------------------------------

The bucket will be created if it don't already exists. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

For example in order to read file `hello.txt` from bucket `helloBucket`, use the following snippet:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-s3://helloBucket?accessKey=yourAccessKey&secretKey=yourSecretKey&prefix=hello.txt")
  .to("file:/var/downloaded");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS 2 Athena component supports 11 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonAthenaClient* (producer) | To use the AmazonAthena as the client |  | AthenaClient
| *configuration* (producer) | The component configuration |  | Athena2Configuration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to perform. It can be startQueryExecution. The value can be one of: startQueryExecution, listQueryExecutions | startQueryExecution | Athena2Operations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Athena client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Athena client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Athena client. The value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which Athena client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

Required S3 component options

You have to provide the amazonS3Client in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon's S3].

== Batch Consumer

This component implements the Batch Consumer.

This allows you for instance to know how many messages exists in this
batch and for instance let the Aggregator
aggregate this number of messages.

=== S3 Producer operations

Camel-AWS s3 component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- copyObject
- deleteObject
- listBuckets
- deleteBucket
- listObjects
- getObject (this will return an S3Object instance)
- getObjectRange (this will return an S3Object instance)

=== Advanced AmazonS3 configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the `S3Client` instance configuration, you can
create your own instance and refer to it in your Camel aws2-s3 component configuration:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-s3://MyBucket?amazonS3Client=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Use KMS with the S3 component

To use AWS KMS to encrypt/decrypt data by using AWS infrastructure you can use the options introduced in 2.21.x like in the following example

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("file:tmp/test?fileName=test.txt")
     .setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, constant("testFile"))
     .to("aws2-s3://mybucket?amazonS3Client=#client&useAwsKMS=true&awsKMSKeyId=3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll ask to S3, to use the KMS key 3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c, to encrypt the file test.txt. When you'll ask to download this file, the decryption will be done directly before the download.

=== Use "useIAMCredentials" with the s3 component

To use AWS IAM credentials, you must first verify that the EC2 in which you are launching the Camel application on has an IAM role associated with it containing the appropriate policies attached to run effectively.
Keep in mind that this feature should only be set to "true" on remote instances. To clarify even further, you must still use static credentials locally since IAM is an AWS specific component,
but AWS environments should now be easier to manage. After this is implemented and understood, you can set the query parameter "useIAMCredentials" to "true" for AWS environments! To effectively toggle this
on and off based on local and remote environments, you can consider enabling this query parameter with system environment variables. For example, your code could set the "useIAMCredentials" query parameter to "true",
when the system environment variable called "isRemote" is set to true (there are many other ways to do this and this should act as a simple example). Although it doesn't take away the need for static credentials completely,
using IAM credentials on AWS environments takes away the need to refresh on remote environments and adds a major security boost (IAM credentials are refreshed automatically every 6 hours and update when their
policies are updated). This is the AWS recommended way to manage credentials and therefore should be used as often as possible.

=== S3 Producer Operation examples

- CopyObject: this operation copy an object from one bucket to a different one

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {

      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.BUCKET_DESTINATION_NAME, "camelDestinationBucket");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.DESTINATION_KEY, "camelDestinationKey");
      }
  })
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=copyObject")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will copy the object with the name expressed in the header camelDestinationKey to the camelDestinationBucket bucket, from the bucket mycamelbucket.

- DeleteObject: this operation deletes an object from a bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {

      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey");
      }
  })
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=deleteObject")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will delete the object camelKey from the bucket mycamelbucket.

- ListBuckets: this operation list the buckets for this account in this region

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start")
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=listBuckets")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will list the buckets for this account

- DeleteBucket: this operation delete the bucket specified as URI parameter or header

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start")
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=deleteBucket")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will delete the bucket mycamelbucket

- DownloadLink: this operation create a download link for the file specified in the key header

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {

      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey");
      }
  })
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=downloadLink")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will create a downloadLink for the file camelKey in the bucket mycamelbucket

- ListObjects: this operation list object in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start")
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=listObjects")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will list the objects in the mycamelbucket bucket

- GetObject: this operation get a single object in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {

      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey");
      }
  })
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=getObject")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will return an S3Object instance related to the camelKey object in mycamelbucket bucket.

- GetObjectRange: this operation get a single object range in a specific bucket

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {

      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camelKey");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.RANGE_START, "0");
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.RANGE_END, "9");
      }
  })
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=getObjectRange")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation will return an S3Object instance related to the camelKey object in mycamelbucket bucket, containing a the bytes from 0 to 9.

== Bucket Autocreation

With the option `autoCreateBucket` users are able to avoid the autocreation of an S3 Bucket in case it doesn't exist. The default for this option is `true`.
If set to false any operation on a not-existent bucket in AWS won't be successful and an error will be returned.

== Automatic detection of AmazonS3 client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonS3 bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter, like the example above.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Moving stuff between a bucket and another bucket

Some users like to consume stuff from a bucket and move the content in a different one without using the copyObject feature of this component.
If this is case for you, don't forget to remove the bucketName header from the incoming exchange of the consumer, otherwise the file will be always overwritten on the same
original bucket.

== MoveAfterRead consumer option

In addition to deleteAfterRead it has been added another option, moveAfterRead. With this option enabled the consumed object will be moved to a target destinationBucket instead of being only deleted.
This will require specifying the destinationBucket option. As example:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&moveAfterRead=true&destinationBucket=myothercamelbucket")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case the objects consumed will be moved to myothercamelbucket bucket and deleted from the original one (because of deleteAfterRead set to true as default).

== Using customer key as encryption

We introduced also the customer key support (an alternative of using KMS). The following code shows an example.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String key = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
byte[] secretKey = generateSecretKey();
String b64Key = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(secretKey);
String b64KeyMd5 = Md5Utils.md5AsBase64(secretKey);

String awsEndpoint = "aws2-s3://mycamel?autoCreateBucket=false&useCustomerKey=true&customerKeyId=RAW(" + b64Key + ")&customerKeyMD5=RAW(" + b64KeyMd5 + ")&customerAlgorithm=" + AES256.name();

from("direct:putObject")
    .setHeader(AWS2S3Constants.KEY, constant("test.txt"))
    .setBody(constant("Test"))
    .to(awsEndpoint);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Using a POJO as body

Sometimes build an AWS Request can be complex, because of multiple options. We introduce the possibility to use a POJO as body.
In AWS S3 there are multiple operations you can submit, as an example for List brokers request, you can do something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:aws2-s3")
     .setBody(ListObjectsRequest.builder().bucket(bucketName).build())
     .to("aws2-s3://test?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=listObjects&pojoRequest=true")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll pass the request directly without the need of passing headers and options specifically related to this operation.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-s3</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version\}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
