= Netty HTTP Component
:page-source: components/camel-netty-http/src/main/docs/netty-http-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.14*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Netty HTTP component is an extension to xref:netty-component.adoc[Netty]
component to facilitiate HTTP transport with xref:netty-component.adoc[Netty].

This camel component supports both producer and consumer endpoints.


[NOTE]
====
*Stream*

Netty is stream based, which means the input it receives is submitted to
Camel as a stream. That means you will only be able to read the content
of the stream *once*. If you find a situation where the message body appears to be empty or
you need to access the data multiple times (eg: doing multicasting, or
redelivery error handling) you should use Stream caching or convert the
message body to a `String` which is safe to be re-read multiple times. 
Notice Netty HTTP reads the entire stream into memory using
`io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpObjectAggregator` to build the entire
full http message. But the resulting message is still a stream based
message which is readable once.
====

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-netty-http</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

The URI scheme for a netty component is as follows

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------
netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:8080[?options]
-------------------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`


[NOTE]
====
*Query parameters vs endpoint options*

You may be wondering how Camel recognizes URI query parameters and
endpoint options. For example you might create endpoint URI as follows:
`netty-http:http//example.com?myParam=myValue&compression=true` . In
this example `myParam` is the HTTP parameter, while `compression` is the
Camel endpoint option. The strategy used by Camel in such situations is
to resolve available endpoint options and remove them from the URI. It
means that for the discussed example, the HTTP request sent by Netty
HTTP producer to the endpoint will look as follows:
`http//example.com?myParam=myValue`, because `compression` endpoint
option will be resolved and removed from the target URL.
Keep also in mind that you cannot specify endpoint options using dynamic
headers (like `CamelHttpQuery`). Endpoint options can be specified only
at the endpoint URI definition level (like `to` or `from` DSL elements).
====

== HTTP Options

[IMPORTANT]
====
*A lot more options*

This component inherits all the options from
xref:netty-component.adoc[Netty], so make sure to look at
the xref:netty-component.adoc[Netty] documentation as well.
Notice that some options from xref:netty-component.adoc[Netty] is not
applicable when using this Netty HTTP component, such as options
related to UDP transport.

// component options: START
The Netty HTTP component supports 75 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (common) | To use the NettyConfiguration as configuration when creating endpoints. |  | NettyConfiguration
| *disconnect* (common) | Whether or not to disconnect(close) from Netty Channel right after use. Can be used for both consumer and producer. | false | boolean
| *keepAlive* (common) | Setting to ensure socket is not closed due to inactivity | true | boolean
| *reuseAddress* (common) | Setting to facilitate socket multiplexing | true | boolean
| *reuseChannel* (common) | This option allows producers and consumers (in client mode) to reuse the same Netty Channel for the lifecycle of processing the Exchange. This is useful if you need to call a server multiple times in a Camel route and want to use the same network connection. When using this, the channel is not returned to the connection pool until the Exchange is done; or disconnected if the disconnect option is set to true. The reused Channel is stored on the Exchange as an exchange property with the key NettyConstants#NETTY_CHANNEL which allows you to obtain the channel during routing and use it as well. | false | boolean
| *sync* (common) | Setting to set endpoint as one-way or request-response | true | boolean
| *tcpNoDelay* (common) | Setting to improve TCP protocol performance | true | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *broadcast* (consumer) | Setting to choose Multicast over UDP | false | boolean
| *clientMode* (consumer) | If the clientMode is true, netty consumer will connect the address as a TCP client. | false | boolean
| *reconnect* (consumer) | Used only in clientMode in consumer, the consumer will attempt to reconnect on disconnection if this is enabled | true | boolean
| *reconnectInterval* (consumer) | Used if reconnect and clientMode is enabled. The interval in milli seconds to attempt reconnection | 10000 | int
| *backlog* (consumer) | Allows to configure a backlog for netty consumer (server). Note the backlog is just a best effort depending on the OS. Setting this option to a value such as 200, 500 or 1000, tells the TCP stack how long the accept queue can be If this option is not configured, then the backlog depends on OS setting. |  | int
| *bossCount* (consumer) | When netty works on nio mode, it uses default bossCount parameter from Netty, which is 1. User can use this option to override the default bossCount from Netty | 1 | int
| *bossGroup* (consumer) | Set the BossGroup which could be used for handling the new connection of the server side across the NettyEndpoint |  | EventLoopGroup
| *disconnectOnNoReply* (consumer) | If sync is enabled then this option dictates NettyConsumer if it should disconnect where there is no reply to send back. | true | boolean
| *executorService* (consumer) | To use the given EventExecutorGroup. |  | EventExecutorGroup
| *maximumPoolSize* (consumer) | Sets a maximum thread pool size for the netty consumer ordered thread pool. The default size is 2 x cpu_core plus 1. Setting this value to eg 10 will then use 10 threads unless 2 x cpu_core plus 1 is a higher value, which then will override and be used. For example if there are 8 cores, then the consumer thread pool will be 17. This thread pool is used to route messages received from Netty by Camel. We use a separate thread pool to ensure ordering of messages and also in case some messages will block, then nettys worker threads (event loop) wont be affected. |  | int
| *nettyServerBootstrapFactory* (consumer) | To use a custom NettyServerBootstrapFactory |  | NettyServerBootstrapFactory
| *networkInterface* (consumer) | When using UDP then this option can be used to specify a network interface by its name, such as eth0 to join a multicast group. |  | String
| *noReplyLogLevel* (consumer) | If sync is enabled this option dictates NettyConsumer which logging level to use when logging a there is no reply to send back. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | WARN | LoggingLevel
| *serverClosedChannelException CaughtLogLevel* (consumer) | If the server (NettyConsumer) catches an java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException then its logged using this logging level. This is used to avoid logging the closed channel exceptions, as clients can disconnect abruptly and then cause a flood of closed exceptions in the Netty server. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | DEBUG | LoggingLevel
| *serverExceptionCaughtLogLevel* (consumer) | If the server (NettyConsumer) catches an exception then its logged using this logging level. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | WARN | LoggingLevel
| *serverInitializerFactory* (consumer) | To use a custom ServerInitializerFactory |  | ServerInitializerFactory
| *usingExecutorService* (consumer) | Whether to use ordered thread pool, to ensure events are processed orderly on the same channel. | true | boolean
| *connectTimeout* (producer) | Time to wait for a socket connection to be available. Value is in milliseconds. | 10000 | int
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *requestTimeout* (producer) | Allows to use a timeout for the Netty producer when calling a remote server. By default no timeout is in use. The value is in milli seconds, so eg 30000 is 30 seconds. The requestTimeout is using Netty's ReadTimeoutHandler to trigger the timeout. |  | long
| *clientInitializerFactory* (producer) | To use a custom ClientInitializerFactory |  | ClientInitializerFactory
| *correlationManager* (producer) | To use a custom correlation manager to manage how request and reply messages are mapped when using request/reply with the netty producer. This should only be used if you have a way to map requests together with replies such as if there is correlation ids in both the request and reply messages. This can be used if you want to multiplex concurrent messages on the same channel (aka connection) in netty. When doing this you must have a way to correlate the request and reply messages so you can store the right reply on the inflight Camel Exchange before its continued routed. We recommend extending the TimeoutCorrelationManagerSupport when you build custom correlation managers. This provides support for timeout and other complexities you otherwise would need to implement as well. See also the producerPoolEnabled option for more details. |  | NettyCamelStateCorrelationManager
| *lazyChannelCreation* (producer) | Channels can be lazily created to avoid exceptions, if the remote server is not up and running when the Camel producer is started. | true | boolean
| *producerPoolEnabled* (producer) | Whether producer pool is enabled or not. Important: If you turn this off then a single shared connection is used for the producer, also if you are doing request/reply. That means there is a potential issue with interleaved responses if replies comes back out-of-order. Therefore you need to have a correlation id in both the request and reply messages so you can properly correlate the replies to the Camel callback that is responsible for continue processing the message in Camel. To do this you need to implement NettyCamelStateCorrelationManager as correlation manager and configure it via the correlationManager option. See also the correlationManager option for more details. | true | boolean
| *producerPoolMaxActive* (producer) | Sets the cap on the number of objects that can be allocated by the pool (checked out to clients, or idle awaiting checkout) at a given time. Use a negative value for no limit. | -1 | int
| *producerPoolMaxIdle* (producer) | Sets the cap on the number of idle instances in the pool. | 100 | int
| *producerPoolMinEvictableIdle* (producer) | Sets the minimum amount of time (value in millis) an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle object evictor. | 300000 | long
| *producerPoolMinIdle* (producer) | Sets the minimum number of instances allowed in the producer pool before the evictor thread (if active) spawns new objects. |  | int
| *udpConnectionlessSending* (producer) | This option supports connection less udp sending which is a real fire and forget. A connected udp send receive the PortUnreachableException if no one is listen on the receiving port. | false | boolean
| *useByteBuf* (producer) | If the useByteBuf is true, netty producer will turn the message body into ByteBuf before sending it out. | false | boolean
| *allowSerializedHeaders* (advanced) | Only used for TCP when transferExchange is true. When set to true, serializable objects in headers and properties will be added to the exchange. Otherwise Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *channelGroup* (advanced) | To use a explicit ChannelGroup. |  | ChannelGroup
| *headerFilterStrategy* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter headers. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *nativeTransport* (advanced) | Whether to use native transport instead of NIO. Native transport takes advantage of the host operating system and is only supported on some platforms. You need to add the netty JAR for the host operating system you are using. See more details at: \http://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html | false | boolean
| *nettyHttpBinding* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding for binding to/from Netty and Camel Message API. |  | NettyHttpBinding
| *options* (advanced) | Allows to configure additional netty options using option. as prefix. For example option.child.keepAlive=false to set the netty option child.keepAlive=false. See the Netty documentation for possible options that can be used. |  | Map
| *receiveBufferSize* (advanced) | The TCP/UDP buffer sizes to be used during inbound communication. Size is bytes. | 65536 | int
| *receiveBufferSizePredictor* (advanced) | Configures the buffer size predictor. See details at Jetty documentation and this mail thread. |  | int
| *sendBufferSize* (advanced) | The TCP/UDP buffer sizes to be used during outbound communication. Size is bytes. | 65536 | int
| *transferExchange* (advanced) | Only used for TCP. You can transfer the exchange over the wire instead of just the body. The following fields are transferred: In body, Out body, fault body, In headers, Out headers, fault headers, exchange properties, exchange exception. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | boolean
| *udpByteArrayCodec* (advanced) | For UDP only. If enabled the using byte array codec instead of Java serialization protocol. | false | boolean
| *workerCount* (advanced) | When netty works on nio mode, it uses default workerCount parameter from Netty (which is cpu_core_threads x 2). User can use this option to override the default workerCount from Netty. |  | int
| *workerGroup* (advanced) | To use a explicit EventLoopGroup as the boss thread pool. For example to share a thread pool with multiple consumers or producers. By default each consumer or producer has their own worker pool with 2 x cpu count core threads. |  | EventLoopGroup
| *allowDefaultCodec* (codec) | The netty component installs a default codec if both, encoder/decoder is null and textline is false. Setting allowDefaultCodec to false prevents the netty component from installing a default codec as the first element in the filter chain. | true | boolean
| *autoAppendDelimiter* (codec) | Whether or not to auto append missing end delimiter when sending using the textline codec. | true | boolean
| *decoderMaxLineLength* (codec) | The max line length to use for the textline codec. | 1024 | int
| *decoders* (codec) | A list of decoders to be used. You can use a String which have values separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the Registry. Just remember to prefix the value with # so Camel knows it should lookup. |  | List
| *delimiter* (codec) | The delimiter to use for the textline codec. Possible values are LINE and NULL. The value can be one of: LINE, NULL | LINE | TextLineDelimiter
| *encoders* (codec) | A list of encoders to be used. You can use a String which have values separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the Registry. Just remember to prefix the value with # so Camel knows it should lookup. |  | List
| *encoding* (codec) | The encoding (a charset name) to use for the textline codec. If not provided, Camel will use the JVM default Charset. |  | String
| *textline* (codec) | Only used for TCP. If no codec is specified, you can use this flag to indicate a text line based codec; if not specified or the value is false, then Object Serialization is assumed over TCP - however only Strings are allowed to be serialized by default. | false | boolean
| *enabledProtocols* (security) | Which protocols to enable when using SSL | TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 | String
| *keyStoreFile* (security) | Client side certificate keystore to be used for encryption |  | File
| *keyStoreFormat* (security) | Keystore format to be used for payload encryption. Defaults to JKS if not set |  | String
| *keyStoreResource* (security) | Client side certificate keystore to be used for encryption. Is loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. |  | String
| *needClientAuth* (security) | Configures whether the server needs client authentication when using SSL. | false | boolean
| *passphrase* (security) | Password setting to use in order to encrypt/decrypt payloads sent using SSH |  | String

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeEndpoint* (common) | If the option is true, the producer will ignore the Exchange.HTTP_URI header, and use the endpoint's URI for request. You may also set the throwExceptionOnFailure to be false to let the producer send all the fault response back.

| *mapHeaders* (consumer) | If this option is enabled, then during binding from Netty to Camel Message then the headers will be mapped as well (eg added as header to the Camel Message as well). You can turn off this option to disable this. The headers can still be accessed from the org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpMessage message with the method getHttpRequest() that returns the Netty HTTP request io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequest instance. | true | boolean

| *traceEnabled* (consumer) | Specifies whether to enable HTTP TRACE for this Netty HTTP consumer. By default TRACE is turned off. | false | boolean
| *urlDecodeHeaders* (consumer) | If this option is enabled, then during binding from Netty to Camel Message then the header values will be URL decoded (eg %20 will be a space character. Notice this option is used by the default org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding and therefore if you implement a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding then you would need to decode the headers accordingly to this option. | false | boolean
| *usingExecutorService* (consumer) | Whether to use ordered thread pool, to ensure events are processed orderly on the same channel. | true | boolean
| *connectTimeout* (producer) | Time to wait for a socket connection to be available. Value is in milliseconds. | 10000 | int

By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *requestTimeout* (producer) | Allows to use a timeout for the Netty producer when calling a remote server. By default no timeout is in use. The value is in milli seconds, so eg 30000 is 30 seconds. The requestTimeout is using Netty's ReadTimeoutHandler to trigger the timeout. |  | long
| *throwExceptionOnFailure* (producer) | Option to disable throwing the HttpOperationFailedException in case of failed responses from the remote server. This allows you to get all responses regardless of the HTTP status code. | true | boolean
| *clientInitializerFactory* (producer) | To use a custom ClientInitializerFactory |  | ClientInitializerFactory
| *lazyChannelCreation* (producer) | Channels can be lazily created to avoid exceptions, if the remote server is not up and running when the Camel producer is started. | true | boolean
| *okStatusCodeRange* (producer) | The status codes which are considered a success response. The values are inclusive. Multiple ranges can be defined, separated by comma, e.g. 200-204,209,301-304. Each range must be a single number or from-to with the dash included. The default range is 200-299 | 200-299 | String
| *producerPoolEnabled* (producer) | Whether producer pool is enabled or not. Important: If you turn this off then a single shared connection is used for the producer, also if you are doing request/reply. That means there is a potential issue with interleaved responses if replies comes back out-of-order. Therefore you need to have a correlation id in both the request and reply messages so you can properly correlate the replies to the Camel callback that is responsible for continue processing the message in Camel. To do this you need to implement NettyCamelStateCorrelationManager as correlation manager and configure it via the correlationManager option. See also the correlationManager option for more details. | true | boolean
| *producerPoolMaxActive* (producer) | Sets the cap on the number of objects that can be allocated by the pool (checked out to clients, or idle awaiting checkout) at a given time. Use a negative value for no limit. | -1 | int
| *producerPoolMaxIdle* (producer) | Sets the cap on the number of idle instances in the pool. | 100 | int
| *producerPoolMinEvictableIdle* (producer) | Sets the minimum amount of time (value in millis) an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle object evictor. | 300000 | long
| *producerPoolMinIdle* (producer) | Sets the minimum number of instances allowed in the producer pool before the evictor thread (if active) spawns new objects. |  | int
| *useRelativePath* (producer) | Sets whether to use a relative path in HTTP requests. | true | boolean
| *allowSerializedHeaders* (advanced) | Only used for TCP when transferExchange is true. When set to true, serializable objects in headers and properties will be added to the exchange. Otherwise Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *channelGroup* (advanced) | To use a explicit ChannelGroup. |  | ChannelGroup
| *configuration* (advanced) | To use a custom configured NettyHttpConfiguration for configuring this endpoint. |  | NettyHttpConfiguration
| *disableStreamCache* (advanced) | Determines whether or not the raw input stream from Netty HttpRequest#getContent() or HttpResponset#getContent() is cached or not (Camel will read the stream into a in light-weight memory based Stream caching) cache. By default Camel will cache the Netty input stream to support reading it multiple times to ensure it Camel can retrieve all data from the stream. However you can set this option to true when you for example need to access the raw stream, such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. Mind that if you enable this option, then you cannot read the Netty stream multiple times out of the box, and you would need manually to reset the reader index on the Netty raw stream. Also Netty will auto-close the Netty stream when the Netty HTTP server/HTTP client is done processing, which means that if the asynchronous routing engine is in use then any asynchronous thread that may continue routing the org.apache.camel.Exchange may not be able to read the Netty stream, because Netty has closed it. | false | boolean
| *headerFilterStrategy* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter headers. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *nativeTransport* (advanced) | Whether to use native transport instead of NIO. Native transport takes advantage of the host operating system and is only supported on some platforms. You need to add the netty JAR for the host operating system you are using. See more details at: \http://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html | false | boolean
| *nettyHttpBinding* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding for binding to/from Netty and Camel Message API. |  | NettyHttpBinding
| *options* (advanced) | Allows to configure additional netty options using option. as prefix. For example option.child.keepAlive=false to set the netty option child.keepAlive=false. See the Netty documentation for possible options that can be used. |  | Map
| *receiveBufferSize* (advanced) | The TCP/UDP buffer sizes to be used during inbound communication. Size is bytes. | 65536 | int
| *receiveBufferSizePredictor* (advanced) | Configures the buffer size predictor. See details at Jetty documentation and this mail thread. |  | int

| *transferException* (advanced) | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side, and if the caused Exception was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is, instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | boolean
| *transferExchange* (advanced) | Only used for TCP. You can transfer the exchange over the wire instead of just the body. The following fields are transferred: In body, Out body, fault body, In headers, Out headers, fault headers, exchange properties, exchange exception. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | boolean
| *workerCount* (advanced) | When netty works on nio mode, it uses default workerCount parameter from Netty (which is cpu_core_threads x 2). User can use this option to override the default workerCount from Netty. |  | int

== Message Headers

The following headers can be used on the producer to control the HTTP
request.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description

|`CamelHttpMethod` |`String` |Allow to control what HTTP method to use such as GET, POST, TRACE etc.
The type can also be a `io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpMethod`
instance.

|`CamelHttpQuery` |`String` |Allows to provide URI query parameters as a `String` value that
overrides the endpoint configuration. Separate multiple parameters using
the & sign. For example: `foo=bar&beer=yes`.

|`CamelHttpPath` |`String` |Allows to provide URI context-path and query parameters as a `String`
value that overrides the endpoint configuration. This allows to reuse
the same producer for calling same remote http server, but using a
dynamic context-path and query parameters.

|`Content-Type` |`String` |To set the content-type of the HTTP body. For example:
`text/plain; charset="UTF-8"`.

|`CamelHttpResponseCode` |`int` |Allows to set the HTTP Status code to use. By default 200 is used for
success, and 500 for failure.
|=======================================================================

The following headers is provided as meta-data when a route starts from
an Netty HTTP endpoint:

The description in the table takes offset in a route having:
`from("netty-http:http:0.0.0.0:8080/myapp")...`

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description

|`CamelHttpMethod` |`String` |The HTTP method used, such as GET, POST, TRACE etc.

|`CamelHttpUrl` |`String` |The URL including protocol, host and port, etc: 
`\http://0.0.0.0:8080/myapp`

|`CamelHttpUri` |`String` |The URI without protocol, host and port, etc:
`/myapp`

|`CamelHttpQuery` |`String` |Any query parameters, such as `foo=bar&beer=yes`

|`CamelHttpRawQuery` |`String` |Any query parameters, such as `foo=bar&beer=yes`. Stored in the raw
form, as they arrived to the consumer (i.e. before URL decoding).

|`CamelHttpPath` |`String` |Additional context-path. This value is empty if the client called the
context-path `/myapp`. If the client calls `/myapp/mystuff`, then this
header value is `/mystuff`. In other words its the value after the
context-path configured on the route endpoint.

|`CamelHttpCharacterEncoding` |`String` |The charset from the content-type header.

|`CamelHttpAuthentication` |`String` |If the user was authenticated using HTTP Basic then this header is added
with the value `Basic`.

|`Content-Type` |`String` |The content type if provided. For example:
`text/plain; charset="UTF-8"`.
|=======================================================================

== Access to Netty types

This component uses the
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpMessage` as the message
implementation on the Exchange. This allows end
users to get access to the original Netty request/response instances if
needed, as shown below. Mind that the original response may not be
accessible at all times.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequest request = exchange.getIn(NettyHttpMessage.class).getHttpRequest();
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Examples

In the route below we use Netty HTTP as a HTTP server, which returns
back a hardcoded "Bye World" message.

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
    from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo")
      .transform().constant("Bye World");
-----------------------------------------------

And we can call this HTTP server using Camel also, with the
ProducerTemplate as shown below:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    String out = template.requestBody("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo", "Hello World", String.class);
    System.out.println(out);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And we get back "Bye World" as the output.

=== How do I let Netty match wildcards

By default Netty HTTP will only match on exact uri's. But you can
instruct Netty to match prefixes. For example

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:8123/foo").to("mock:foo");
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the route above Netty HTTP will only match if the uri is an exact
match, so it will match if you enter +
 `\http://0.0.0.0:8123/foo` but not match if you do
`\http://0.0.0.0:8123/foo/bar`.

So if you want to enable wildcard matching you do as follows:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:8123/foo?matchOnUriPrefix=true").to("mock:foo");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now Netty matches any endpoints with starts with `foo`.

To match *any* endpoint you can do:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:8123?matchOnUriPrefix=true").to("mock:foo");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Using multiple routes with same port

In the same CamelContext you can have multiple
routes from Netty HTTP that shares the same port (eg a
`io.netty.bootstrap.ServerBootstrap` instance). Doing this requires a
number of bootstrap options to be identical in the routes, as the routes
will share the same `io.netty.bootstrap.ServerBootstrap` instance. The
instance will be configured with the options from the first route
created.

The options the routes must be identical configured is all the options
defined in the
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyServerBootstrapConfiguration`
configuration class. If you have configured another route with different
options, Camel will throw an exception on startup, indicating the
options is not identical. To mitigate this ensure all options is
identical.

Here is an example with two routes that share the same port.

*Two routes sharing the same port*

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/foo")
  .to("mock:foo")
  .transform().constant("Bye World");

from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/bar")
  .to("mock:bar")
  .transform().constant("Bye Camel");
-----------------------------------------------

And here is an example of a mis configured 2nd route that do not have
identical
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyServerBootstrapConfiguration`
option as the 1st route. This will cause Camel to fail on startup.

*Two routes sharing the same port, but the 2nd route is misconfigured
and will fail on starting*

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/foo")
  .to("mock:foo")
  .transform().constant("Bye World");

// we cannot have a 2nd route on same port with SSL enabled, when the 1st route is NOT
from("netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/bar?ssl=true")
  .to("mock:bar")
  .transform().constant("Bye Camel");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Reusing same server bootstrap configuration with multiple routes

By configuring the common server bootstrap option in an single instance
of a
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyServerBootstrapConfiguration`
type, we can use the `bootstrapConfiguration` option on the Netty HTTP
consumers to refer and reuse the same options across all consumers.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="nettyHttpBootstrapOptions" class="org.apache.camel.component.netty.NettyServerBootstrapConfiguration">
  <property name="backlog" value="200"/>
  <property name="connectionTimeout" value="20000"/>
  <property name="workerCount" value="16"/>
</bean>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And in the routes you refer to this option as shown below

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/foo?bootstrapConfiguration=#nettyHttpBootstrapOptions"/>
  ...
</route>

<route>
  <from uri="netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/bar?bootstrapConfiguration=#nettyHttpBootstrapOptions"/>
  ...
</route>

<route>
  <from uri="netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/beer?bootstrapConfiguration=#nettyHttpBootstrapOptions"/>
  ...
</route>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Reusing same server bootstrap configuration with multiple routes across multiple bundles in OSGi container

See the Netty HTTP Server Example
for more details and example how to do that.

=== Implementing a reverse proxy

Netty HTTP component can act as a reverse proxy, in that case
`Exchange.HTTP_SCHEME`, `Exchange.HTTP_HOST` and
`Exchange.HTTP_PORT` headers are populated from the absolute
URL received on the request line of the HTTP request.

Here's an example of a HTTP proxy that simply transforms the response
from the origin server to uppercase.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("netty-http:proxy://0.0.0.0:8080")
    .toD("netty-http:"
        + "${headers." + Exchange.HTTP_SCHEME + "}://"
        + "${headers." + Exchange.HTTP_HOST + "}:"
        + "${headers." + Exchange.HTTP_PORT + "}")
    .process(this::processResponse);

void processResponse(final Exchange exchange) {
    final NettyHttpMessage message = exchange.getIn(NettyHttpMessage.class);
    final FullHttpResponse response = message.getHttpResponse();

    final ByteBuf buf = response.content();
    final String string = buf.toString(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

    buf.resetWriterIndex();
    ByteBufUtil.writeUtf8(buf, string.toUpperCase(Locale.US));
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Using HTTP Basic Authentication

The Netty HTTP consumer supports HTTP basic authentication by specifying
the security realm name to use, as shown below

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
   <from uri="netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/foo?securityConfiguration.realm=karaf"/>
   ...
</route>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The realm name is mandatory to enable basic authentication. By default
the JAAS based authenticator is used, which will use the realm name
specified (karaf in the example above) and use the JAAS realm and the
JAAS \{\{LoginModule}}s of this realm for authentication.

End user of Apache Karaf / ServiceMix has a karaf realm out of the box,
and hence why the example above would work out of the box in these
containers.

=== Specifying ACL on web resources

The `org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.SecurityConstraint` allows
to define constrains on web resources. And the
`org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.SecurityConstraintMapping` is
provided out of the box, allowing to easily define inclusions and
exclusions with roles.

For example as shown below in the XML DSL, we define the constraint
bean:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <bean id="constraint" class="org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.SecurityConstraintMapping">
    <!-- inclusions defines url -> roles restrictions -->
    <!-- a * should be used for any role accepted (or even no roles) -->
    <property name="inclusions">
      <map>
        <entry key="/*" value="*"/>
        <entry key="/admin/*" value="admin"/>
        <entry key="/guest/*" value="admin,guest"/>
      </map>
    </property>
    <!-- exclusions is used to define public urls, which requires no authentication -->
    <property name="exclusions">
      <set>
        <value>/public/*</value>
      </set>
    </property>
  </bean>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The constraint above is define so that

* access to /* is restricted and any roles is accepted (also if user has
no roles)
* access to /admin/* requires the admin role
* access to /guest/* requires the admin or guest role
* access to /public/* is an exclusion which means no authentication is
needed, and is therefore public for everyone without logging in

To use this constraint we just need to refer to the bean id as shown
below:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
   <from uri="netty-http:http://0.0.0.0:{{port}}/foo?matchOnUriPrefix=true&amp;securityConfiguration.realm=karaf&amp;securityConfiguration.securityConstraint=#constraint"/>
   ...
</route>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
