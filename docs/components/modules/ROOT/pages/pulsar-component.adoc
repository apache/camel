= Apache Pulsar Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.24*


Maven users will need to add the following dependency to
their `pom.xml` for this component.

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-pulsar</artifactId>

== Options


// component options: START
The Apache Pulsar component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoConfiguration* (advanced) | The pulsar auto configuration |  | AutoConfiguration
| *pulsarClient* (advanced) | The pulsar client |  | PulsarClient
| *allowManual Acknowledgement* (consumer) | Whether to allow manual message acknowledgements. If this option is enabled, then messages are not immediately acknowledged after being consumed. Instead, an instance of PulsarMessageReceipt is stored as a header on the org.apache.camel.Exchange. Messages can then be acknowledged using PulsarMessageReceipt at any time before the ackTimeout occurs. | false | boolean
| *pulsarMessageReceipt Factory* (consumer) | Provide a factory to create an alternate implementation of PulsarMessageReceipt. |  | PulsarMessageReceipt Factory
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Apache Pulsar endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
pulsar:persistence://tenant/namespace/topic
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (4 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *persistence* | *Required* Whether the topic is persistent or non-persistent |  | String
| *tenant* | *Required* The tenant |  | String
| *namespace* | *Required* The namespace |  | String
| *topic* | *Required* The topic |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (25 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *ackGroupTimeMillis* (consumer) | Group the consumer acknowledgments for the specified time in milliseconds - defaults to 100 | 100 | long
| *ackTimeoutMillis* (consumer) | Timeout for unacknowledged messages in milliseconds - defaults to 10000 | 10000 | long
| *allowManualAcknowledgement* (consumer) | Whether to allow manual message acknowledgements. If this option is enabled, then messages are not immediately acknowledged after being consumed. Instead, an instance of PulsarMessageReceipt is stored as a header on the org.apache.camel.Exchange. Messages can then be acknowledged using PulsarMessageReceipt at any time before the ackTimeout occurs. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *consumerName* (consumer) | Name of the consumer when subscription is EXCLUSIVE | sole-consumer | String
| *consumerNamePrefix* (consumer) | Prefix to add to consumer names when a SHARED or FAILOVER subscription is used | cons | String
| *consumerQueueSize* (consumer) | Size of the consumer queue - defaults to 10 | 10 | int
| *numberOfConsumers* (consumer) | Number of consumers - defaults to 1 | 1 | int
| *subscriptionName* (consumer) | Name of the subscription to use | subs | String
| *subscriptionType* (consumer) | Type of the subscription EXCLUSIVESHAREDFAILOVER, defaults to EXCLUSIVE | EXCLUSIVE | SubscriptionType
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *batchingEnabled* (producer) | Control whether automatic batching of messages is enabled for the producer. Default is true. | true | boolean
| *batchingMaxMessages* (producer) | Set the maximum number of messages permitted in a batch. Default 1,000. | 1000 | int
| *batchingMaxPublishDelay Micros* (producer) | Set the time period within which the messages sent will be batched if batch messages are enabled. If set to a non zero value, messages will be queued until either: this time interval expires the max number of messages in a batch is reached Default is 1ms. | 1000 | long
| *blockIfQueueFull* (producer) | Set whether the send and asyncSend operations should block when the outgoing message queue is full. If set to false, send operations will immediately fail with ProducerQueueIsFullError when there is no space left in the pending queue. Default is false. | false | boolean
| *compressionType* (producer) | Set the compression type for the producer. Supported compression types are: NONE: No compression LZ4: Compress with LZ4 algorithm. Faster but lower compression than ZLib ZLI: Standard ZLib compression Default is NONE | NONE | CompressionType
| *initialSequenceId* (producer) | Set the baseline for the sequence ids for messages published by the producer. First message will be using (initialSequenceId 1) as its sequence id and subsequent messages will be assigned incremental sequence ids, if not otherwise specified. | -1 | long
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *maxPendingMessages* (producer) | Set the max size of the queue holding the messages pending to receive an acknowledgment from the broker. Default is 1000. | 1000 | int
| *maxPendingMessagesAcross Partitions* (producer) | Set the number of max pending messages across all the partitions. Default is 50000. | 50000 | int
| *producerName* (producer) | Name of the producer | default-producer | String
| *sendTimeoutMs* (producer) | Send timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 30,000ms (30 seconds) | 30000 | int
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-pulsar-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

The component supports 6 options, which are listed below.

Messages can then be acknowledged using PulsarMessageReceipt at any time before the ackTimeout occurs. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.pulsar.auto-configuration* | The pulsar auto configuration. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.pulsar.utils.AutoConfiguration type. |  | String
| *camel.component.pulsar.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
