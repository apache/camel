= Apache Pulsar Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.24*


Maven users will need to add the following dependency to
their `pom.xml` for this component.

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-pulsar</artifactId>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>

== Options


// component options: START
The Apache Pulsar component supports 6 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoConfiguration* (advanced) | The pulsar auto configuration |  | AutoConfiguration
| *pulsarClient* (advanced) | The pulsar client |  | PulsarClient
| *allowManual Acknowledgement* (consumer) | Whether to allow manual message acknowledgements. If this option is enabled, then messages are not immediately acknowledged after being consumed. Instead, an instance of PulsarMessageReceipt is stored as a header on the org.apache.camel.Exchange. Messages can then be acknowledged using PulsarMessageReceipt at any time before the ackTimeout occurs. | false | boolean
| *pulsarMessageReceipt Factory* (consumer) | Provide a factory to create an alternate implementation of PulsarMessageReceipt. |  | PulsarMessageReceipt Factory
| *resolveProperty Placeholders* (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Apache Pulsar endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
pulsar:persistence://tenant/namespace/topic
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (4 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *persistence* | *Required* Whether the topic is persistent or non-persistent |  | String
| *tenant* | *Required* The tenant |  | String
| *namespace* | *Required* The namespace |  | String
| *topic* | *Required* The topic |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (16 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *ackGroupTimeMillis* (consumer) | Group the consumer acknowledgments for the specified time in milliseconds - defaults to 100 | 100 | long
| *ackTimeoutMillis* (consumer) | Timeout for unacknowledged messages in milliseconds - defaults to 10000 | 10000 | long
| *allowManualAcknowledgement* (consumer) | Whether to allow manual message acknowledgements. If this option is enabled, then messages are not immediately acknowledged after being consumed. Instead, an instance of PulsarMessageReceipt is stored as a header on the org.apache.camel.Exchange. Messages can then be acknowledged using PulsarMessageReceipt at any time before the ackTimeout occurs. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *consumerName* (consumer) | Name of the consumer when subscription is EXCLUSIVE | sole-consumer | String
| *consumerNamePrefix* (consumer) | Prefix to add to consumer names when a SHARED or FAILOVER subscription is used | cons | String
| *consumerQueueSize* (consumer) | Size of the consumer queue - defaults to 10 | 10 | int
| *numberOfConsumers* (consumer) | Number of consumers - defaults to 1 | 1 | int
| *subscriptionName* (consumer) | Name of the subscription to use | subs | String
| *subscriptionType* (consumer) | Type of the subscription EXCLUSIVESHAREDFAILOVER, defaults to EXCLUSIVE | EXCLUSIVE | SubscriptionType
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *producerName* (producer) | Name of the producer | default-producer | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-pulsar-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

| *camel.component.pulsar.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the pulsar component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.pulsar.pulsar-client* | The pulsar client. The option is a org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClient type. |  | String
