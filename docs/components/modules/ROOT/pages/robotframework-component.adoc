== Robotframework Component
*Available as of Camel version 3.0*

The *robotframework:* component allows for processing camel exchanges
in acceptence test suites which are already implemented with its own DSL. 
The depending keyword libraries that can be used inside test suites 
implemented in Robot DSL, could have been implemented either via 
Java or Pyhton.

This component will let you execute business logic of acceptence test cases 
in Robot language on which you can pass parameters to feed data via power 
of Camel Routes, however there is no reverse binding of parameters back where
you can pass values back into Camel exchange. Therefore, for that reason, it actually
acts like a template language passing camel exchanges by binding data into the test 
cases implemented.

### URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------
robotframework:templateName[?options]
-------------------------------

Where *templateName* is the classpath-local URI of the template to
invoke; or the complete URL of the remote template (eg:
\file://folder/myfile.robot).

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

### Options

// component options: START
The Robot Framework component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (advanced) | The configuration |  | RobotFrameworkCamelConfiguration
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Robot Framework endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
robotframework:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* Path to the resource. You can prefix with: classpath, file, http, ref, or bean. classpath, file and http loads the resource using these protocols (classpath is default). ref will lookup the resource in the registry. bean will call a method on a bean to be used as the resource. For bean you can specify the method name after dot, eg bean:myBean.myMethod. |  | String

| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutorService
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component | none | String

### Samples

For example you could use something like:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------
from("direct:setVariableCamelBody")
.to("robotframework:src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/robotframework/set_variable_camel_body.robot")
-------------------------------------------

To use a robot test case to execute and collect the results
and pass them to generate custom report if such need happens

It's possible to specify what template the component
should use dynamically via a header, so for example:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in")
.setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot").
  to("robotframework:dummy");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robotframework component helps you pass values into robot test cases 
with the similar approach how you would be able to pass values using 
Camel Simple Language. Components supports passing values in three
different ways. Exchange body, headers and properties.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in")
.setBody(constant("Hello Robot"))
.setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot").
  to("robotframework:dummy");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: robotframework

    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Body Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${body}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${body}
    
[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in")
.setHeader("testHeader", constant("testHeaderValue"))
.setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot").
  to("robotframework:dummy");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: robotframework

    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${headers.testHeader}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${headers.testHeader}
    
[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:in")
.setProperty"testProperty", constant("testPropertyValue"))
.setHeader(RobotFrameworkCamelConstants.CAMEL_ROBOT_RESOURCE_URI).constant("path/to/my/template.robot").
  to("robotframework:dummy");
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code:: robotframework

    *** Test Cases ***
    Set Variable Camel Header Test Case
    ${myvar} =    Set Variable    ${properties.testProperty}
    Should Be True    ${myvar} == ${properties.testProperty}

Please note that when you pass values through Camel Exchange to test cases,
they will be available as case-sensitive ``body``, ``headers.[yourHeaderName]`` and ``properties.[yourPropertyName]``
