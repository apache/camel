= OpenStack Cinder Component
:page-source: components/camel-openstack/src/main/docs/openstack-cinder-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.19*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Openstack Cinder component allows messages to be sent to an OpenStack block storage services.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-openstack</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.


== URI Format

[source,java]
----------------------------
openstack-cinder://hosturl[?options]
----------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format
`?options=value&option2=value&...`

== URI Options

// component options: START
The OpenStack Cinder component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The OpenStack Cinder endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
openstack-cinder:host
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type

| *apiVersion* (producer) | OpenStack API version. The value can be one of: V2, V3 | V3 | String
| *config* (producer) | OpenStack configuration |  | Config
| *domain* (producer) | Authentication domain | default | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean

| *username* (producer) | *Required* OpenStack username |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END



== Usage
You can use following settings for each subsystem:

== volumes

=== Operations you can perform with the Volume producer
[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|=========================================================================
|Operation | Description

|`create` | Create new volume.

|`get` | Get the volume.

|`getAll` | Get all volumes.

|`getAllTypes` | Get volume types.

|`update` | Update the volume.

|`delete` | Delete the volume.
|=========================================================================

=== Message headers evaluated by the Volume producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
