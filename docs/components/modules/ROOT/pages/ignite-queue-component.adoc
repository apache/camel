The Ignite Queue endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to interact with https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/queue-and-set[Ignite Queue data structures].

This endpoint only supports producers.

== Options

// component options: START
The Ignite Queues component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *ignite* (producer) | Sets the Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *configurationResource* (producer) | Sets the resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URI, String (URI) or an InputStream. |  | Object
| *igniteConfiguration* (producer) | Allows the user to set a programmatic IgniteConfiguration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Ignite Queues endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
ignite-queue:name
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *name* | *Required* The queue name. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *capacity* (producer) | The queue capacity. Default: non-bounded. |  | int
| *configuration* (producer) | The collection configuration. Default: empty configuration. You can also conveniently set inner properties by using configuration.xyz=123 options. |  | CollectionConfiguration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to invoke on the Ignite Queue. Superseded by the IgniteConstants.IGNITE_QUEUE_OPERATION header in the IN message. Possible values: CONTAINS, ADD, SIZE, REMOVE, ITERATOR, CLEAR, RETAIN_ALL, ARRAY, DRAIN, ELEMENT, PEEK, OFFER, POLL, TAKE, PUT. |  | IgniteQueueOperation
| *propagateIncomingBodyIfNo ReturnValue* (producer) | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | boolean
| *timeoutMillis* (producer) | The queue timeout in milliseconds. Default: no timeout. |  | Long
| *treatCollectionsAsCache Objects* (producer) | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute, etc. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-ignite-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.ignite-queue.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-queue.configuration-resource* | Sets the resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URI, String (URI) or an InputStream. The option is a java.lang.Object type. |  | String
| *camel.component.ignite-queue.enabled* | Enable ignite-queue component | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.ignite-queue.ignite* | Sets the Ignite instance. The option is a org.apache.ignite.Ignite type. |  | String
