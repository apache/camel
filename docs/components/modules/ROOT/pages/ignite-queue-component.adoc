*Since Camel 2.17*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Ignite Queue endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to interact with https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/queue-and-set[Ignite Queue data structures].

This endpoint only supports producers.

== Options

// component options: START
The Ignite Queues component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configurationResource* (producer) | Resource from where to load configuration. |  | Object
| *ignite* (producer) | Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *igniteConfiguration* (producer) | Ignite configuration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Ignite Queues endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
ignite-queue:name

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *name* | *Required* The queue name. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *capacity* (producer) | The queue capacity. Default: non-bounded. |  | int
| *configuration* (producer) | The collection configuration. Default: empty configuration. You can also conveniently set inner properties by using configuration.xyz=123 options. |  | CollectionConfiguration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to invoke on the Ignite Queue. Superseded by the IgniteConstants.IGNITE_QUEUE_OPERATION header in the IN message. Possible values: CONTAINS, ADD, SIZE, REMOVE, ITERATOR, CLEAR, RETAIN_ALL, ARRAY, DRAIN, ELEMENT, PEEK, OFFER, POLL, TAKE, PUT. The value can be one of: CONTAINS, ADD, SIZE, REMOVE, ITERATOR, CLEAR, RETAIN_ALL, ARRAY, DRAIN, ELEMENT, PEEK, OFFER, POLL, TAKE, PUT |  | IgniteQueueOperation
| *propagateIncomingBodyIfNo ReturnValue* (producer) | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | boolean
| *timeoutMillis* (producer) | The queue timeout in milliseconds. Default: no timeout. |  | Long
| *treatCollectionsAsCacheObjects* (producer) | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute, etc. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

=== Headers used

This endpoint uses the following headers:
[width="100%",cols="1,1,1,4",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Header name | Constant | Expected type | Description
| CamelIgniteQueueOperation | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_QUEUE_OPERATION | IgniteQueueOperation enum |
Allows you to dynamically change the queue operation.

| CamelIgniteQueueMaxElements | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_QUEUE_MAX_ELEMENTS | Integer or int |
When invoking the DRAIN operation, the amount of items to drain.

| CamelIgniteQueueTransferredCount | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_QUEUE_TRANSFERRED_COUNT | Integer or int |
The amount of items transferred as the result of the DRAIN operation.

| CamelIgniteQueueTimeoutMillis | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS | Long or long |
Dynamically sets the timeout in milliseconds to use when invoking the OFFER or POLL operations.
