*Since Camel 2.12*

// HEADER START
*Only consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Quartz component provides a scheduled delivery of messages using
the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[Quartz Scheduler 2.x].  +
 Each endpoint represents a different timer (in Quartz terms, a Trigger
and JobDetail).

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quartz</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------


== URI format

----
quartz://timerName?options
quartz://groupName/timerName?options
quartz://groupName/timerName?cron=expression
quartz://timerName?cron=expression
----

The component uses either a `CronTrigger` or a `SimpleTrigger`. If no
cron expression is provided, the component uses a simple trigger. If no
`groupName` is provided, the quartz component uses the `Camel` group
name.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options



// component options: START
The Quartz component supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *enableJmx* (consumer) | Whether to enable Quartz JMX which allows to manage the Quartz scheduler from JMX. This options is default true | true | boolean
| *prefixInstanceName* (consumer) | Whether to prefix the Quartz Scheduler instance name with the CamelContext name. This is enabled by default, to let each CamelContext use its own Quartz scheduler instance by default. You can set this option to false to reuse Quartz scheduler instances between multiple CamelContext's. | true | boolean
| *prefixJobNameWithEndpointId* (consumer) | Whether to prefix the quartz job with the endpoint id. This option is default false. | false | boolean
| *properties* (consumer) | Properties to configure the Quartz scheduler. |  | Map
| *propertiesFile* (consumer) | File name of the properties to load from the classpath |  | String
| *propertiesRef* (consumer) | References to an existing Properties or Map to lookup in the registry to use for configuring quartz. |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *scheduler* (advanced) | To use the custom configured Quartz scheduler, instead of creating a new Scheduler. |  | Scheduler
| *schedulerFactory* (advanced) | To use the custom SchedulerFactory which is used to create the Scheduler. |  | SchedulerFactory
| *autoStartScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether or not the scheduler should be auto started. This options is default true | true | boolean
| *interruptJobsOnShutdown* (scheduler) | Whether to interrupt jobs on shutdown which forces the scheduler to shutdown quicker and attempt to interrupt any running jobs. If this is enabled then any running jobs can fail due to being interrupted. | false | boolean
| *startDelayedSeconds* (scheduler) | Seconds to wait before starting the quartz scheduler. |  | int

// endpoint options: START
The Quartz endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
quartz:groupName/triggerName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *groupName* | The quartz group name to use. The combination of group name and timer name should be unique. | Camel | String
| *triggerName* | *Required* The quartz timer name to use. The combination of group name and timer name should be unique. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (20 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===

Notice you cannot have both deleteJob and pauseJob set to true. | true | boolean
| *durableJob* (consumer) | Whether or not the job should remain stored after it is orphaned (no triggers point to it). | false | boolean
| *pauseJob* (consumer) | If set to true, then the trigger automatically pauses when route stop. Else if set to false, it will remain in scheduler. When set to false, it will also mean user may reuse pre-configured trigger with camel Uri. Just ensure the names match. Notice you cannot have both deleteJob and pauseJob set to true. | false | boolean
| *recoverableJob* (consumer) | Instructs the scheduler whether or not the job should be re-executed if a 'recovery' or 'fail-over' situation is encountered. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: END



For example, the following routing rule will fire two timer events to
the `mock:results` endpoint:

[source,java]
----
from("quartz://myGroup/myTimerName?trigger.repeatInterval=2&trigger.repeatCount=1").routeId("myRoute")
    .to("mock:result");
----

When using `stateful=true`, the
http://quartz-scheduler.org/api/2.0.0/org/quartz/JobDataMap.html[JobDataMap]
is re-persisted after every execution of the job, thus preserving state
for the next execution.

[NOTE]
====
*Running in OSGi and having multiple bundles with quartz routes*

If you run in OSGi such as Apache ServiceMix, or Apache Karaf, and have
multiple bundles with Camel routes that start from
xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] endpoints, then make sure if you assign an `id`
to the `<camelContext>` that this id is unique, as this is
required by the `QuartzScheduler` in the OSGi container. If you do not
set any `id` on `<camelContext>` then a unique id is auto assigned, and there is no problem.
====

== Configuring quartz.properties file

By default Quartz will look for a `quartz.properties` file in the
`org/quartz` directory of the classpath. If you are using WAR
deployments this means just drop the quartz.properties in
`WEB-INF/classes/org/quartz`.

However the Camel xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component also allows you
to configure properties:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Default |Type |Description

|`properties` |`null` |`Properties` |You can configure a `java.util.Properties` instance.

|`propertiesFile` |`null` |`String` |File name of the properties to load from the classpath
|===

To do this you can configure this in Spring XML as follows

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="quartz" class="org.apache.camel.component.quartz.QuartzComponent">
    <property name="propertiesFile" value="com/mycompany/myquartz.properties"/>
</bean>
----

== Enabling Quartz scheduler in JMX

You need to configure the quartz scheduler properties to enable JMX. +
 That is typically setting the option
`"org.quartz.scheduler.jmx.export"` to a `true` value in the
configuration file.

This option is set to true by default, unless explicitly disabled.

== Starting the Quartz scheduler

The xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component offers an option to let the
Quartz scheduler be started delayed, or not auto started at all.

This is an example:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="quartz" class="org.apache.camel.component.quartz.QuartzComponent">
    <property name="startDelayedSeconds" value="5"/>
</bean>
----

== Clustering

If you use Quartz in clustered mode, e.g. the `JobStore` is clustered.
Then the xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component will *not* pause/remove
triggers when a node is being stopped/shutdown. This allows the trigger
to keep running on the other nodes in the cluster.

*Note*: When running in clustered node no checking is done to ensure
unique job name/group for endpoints.

== Message Headers

Camel adds the getters from the Quartz Execution Context as header
values. The following headers are added: +
 `calendar`, `fireTime`, `jobDetail`, `jobInstance`, `jobRuntTime`,
`mergedJobDataMap`, `nextFireTime`, `previousFireTime`, `refireCount`,
`result`, `scheduledFireTime`, `scheduler`, `trigger`, `triggerName`,
`triggerGroup`.

The `fireTime` header contains the `java.util.Date` of when the exchange
was fired.

== Using Cron Triggers

Quartz supports
http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html[Cron-like
expressions] for specifying timers in a handy format. You can use these
expressions in the `cron` URI parameter; though to preserve valid URI
encoding we allow + to be used instead of spaces.

For example, the following will fire a message every five minutes
starting at 12pm (noon) to 6pm on weekdays:

[source,java]
----
from("quartz://myGroup/myTimerName?cron=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI")
    .to("activemq:Totally.Rocks");
----

which is equivalent to using the cron expression

----
0 0/5 12-18 ? * MON-FRI
----

The following table shows the URI character encodings we use to preserve
valid URI syntax:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|URI Character |Cron character

|`+` | _Space_
|===

== Specifying time zone

The Quartz Scheduler allows you to configure time zone per trigger. For
example to use a timezone of your country, then you can do as follows:

----
quartz://groupName/timerName?cron=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI&trigger.timeZone=Europe/Stockholm
----

The timeZone value is the values accepted by `java.util.TimeZone`.

== Configuring misfire instructions

The quartz scheduler can be configured with a misfire instruction
to handle misfire situations for the trigger.
The concrete trigger type that you are using will have defined a set of additional `MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_XXX`
constants that may be set as this property's value.

For example to configure the simple trigger to use misfire instruction 4:

----
quartz://myGroup/myTimerName?trigger.repeatInterval=2000&trigger.misfireInstruction=4
----

And likewise you can configure the cron trigger with one of its misfire instructions as well:
----
quartz://myGroup/myTimerName?cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?trigger.misfireInstruction=2
----

The simple and cron triggers has the following misfire instructions representative:

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_NOW = 1 (default)

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be fired now by Scheduler.

This instruction should typically only be used for
'one-shot' (non-repeating) Triggers. If it is used on a trigger with a
repeat count > 0 then it is equivalent to the instruction MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_REMAINING_REPEAT_COUNT.

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_EXISTING_REPEAT_COUNT = 2

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to 'now' (even if the associated Calendar excludes 'now')
with the repeat count left as-is.  This does obey the
Trigger end-time however, so if 'now' is after the
end-time the Trigger will not fire again.

Use of this instruction causes the trigger to 'forget'
the start-time and repeat-count that it was originally setup with (this
is only an issue if you for some reason wanted to be able to tell what
the original values were at some later time).

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_REMAINING_REPEAT_COUNT = 3

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to 'now' (even if the associated Calendar
excludes 'now') with the repeat count set to what it would be, if it had
not missed any firings.  This does obey the Trigger end-time
however, so if 'now' is after the end-time the Trigger will
not fire again.

Use of this instruction causes the trigger to 'forget'
the start-time and repeat-count that it was originally setup with.
Instead, the repeat count on the trigger will be changed to whatever
the remaining repeat count is (this is only an issue if you for some
reason wanted to be able to tell what the original values were at some
later time).

This instruction could cause the Trigger
to go to the 'COMPLETE' state after firing 'now', if all the
repeat-fire-times where missed.

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_REMAINING_COUNT = 4

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to the next scheduled time after 'now' - taking into
account any associated Calendar and with the
repeat count set to what it would be, if it had not missed any firings.

WARNING: This instruction could cause the Trigger
to go directly to the 'COMPLETE' state if all fire-times where missed.

=== SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NEXT_WITH_EXISTING_COUNT = 5

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the SimpleTrigger wants to be
re-scheduled to the next scheduled time after 'now' - taking into
account any associated Calendar, and with the repeat count left unchanged.

WARNING: This instruction could cause the Trigger
to go directly to the 'COMPLETE' state if the end-time of the trigger
has arrived.

=== CronTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_ONCE_NOW = 1 (default)

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the CronTrigger wants to be fired now by Scheduler.

=== CronTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_DO_NOTHING = 2

Instructs the Scheduler that upon a mis-fire
situation, the CronTrigger wants to have it's
next-fire-time updated to the next time in the schedule after the
current time (taking into account any associated Calendar
but it does not want to be fired now.


== Using QuartzScheduledPollConsumerScheduler

The xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component provides a
Polling Consumer scheduler which allows to
use cron based scheduling for xref:{eip-vc}:eips:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumer] such as the File and FTP
consumers.

For example to use a cron based expression to poll for files every 2nd
second, then a Camel route can be define simply as:

[source,java]
----
    from("file:inbox?scheduler=quartz&scheduler.cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?")
       .to("bean:process");
----

Notice we define the `scheduler=quartz` to instruct Camel to use the
xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] based scheduler. Then we use `scheduler.xxx`
options to configure the scheduler. The xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz]
scheduler requires the cron option to be set.

The following options is supported:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Default |Type |Description

|`quartzScheduler` |`null` |`org.quartz.Scheduler` |To use a custom Quartz scheduler. If none configure then the shared
scheduler from the xref:quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component is used.

|`cron` |`null` |`String` |*Mandatory*: To define the cron expression for triggering the polls.

|`triggerId` |`null` |`String` |To specify the trigger id. If none provided then an UUID is generated
and used.

|`triggerGroup` |`QuartzScheduledPollConsumerScheduler` |`String` |To specify the trigger group.

|`timeZone` |`Default` |`TimeZone` |The time zone to use for the CRON trigger.
|===

*Important:* Remember configuring these options from the endpoint
URIs must be prefixed with `scheduler.`.
For example to configure the trigger id and group:

[source,java]
----
    from("file:inbox?scheduler=quartz&scheduler.cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?&scheduler.triggerId=myId&scheduler.triggerGroup=myGroup")
       .to("bean:process");
----

There is also a CRON scheduler in Spring, so you can
use the following as well:

[source,java]
----
    from("file:inbox?scheduler=spring&scheduler.cron=0/2+*+*+*+*+?")
       .to("bean:process");
----

== Cron Component Support

The Quartz component can be used as implementation of the Camel Cron component.


Maven users will need to add the following additional dependency to their `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-cron</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Users can then use the cron component instead of the quartz component, as in the following route:

[source,java]
----
    from("cron://name?schedule=0+0/5+12-18+?+*+MON-FRI")
    .to("activemq:Totally.Rocks");
----

include::camel-spring-boot::page$quartz-starter.adoc[]
