= Google BigQuery Component
:page-source: components/camel-google-bigquery/src/main/docs/google-bigquery-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.20*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Google Bigquery component provides access
to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/[Cloud BigQuery Infrastructure] via
the https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/apis/bigquery/v2[Google Client Services API].

The current implementation does not use gRPC.

The current implementation does not support querying BigQuery i.e. is a producer only.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-google-bigquery</artifactId>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>

[[GoogleBigQuery-AuthenticationConfiguration]]

== Authentication Configuration

Google BigQuery component authentication is targeted for use with the GCP Service Accounts.
For more information please refer to https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication[Google Cloud Platform Auth Guide]

Google security credentials can be set explicitly via one of the two options:

* Service Account Email and Service Account Key (PEM format)
* GCP credentials file location

If both are set, the Service Account Email/Key will take precedence.

Or implicitly, where the connection factory falls back on
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#howtheywork[Application Default Credentials].

*OBS!* The location of the default credentials file is configurable - via GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable.

Service Account Email and Service Account Key can be found in the GCP JSON credentials file as client_email and private_key respectively.

== URI Format

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------------
        google-bigquery://project-id:datasetId[:tableId]?[options]
--------------------------------------------------------


== Options

// component options: START
The Google BigQuery component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *connectionFactory* (producer) | ConnectionFactory to obtain connection to Bigquery Service. If non provided the default one will be used |  | GoogleBigQueryConnectionFactory
| *datasetId* (producer) | BigQuery Dataset Id |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *projectId* (producer) | Google Cloud Project Id |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The Google BigQuery endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
google-bigquery:projectId:datasetId:tableId
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (3 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *projectId* | *Required* Google Cloud Project Id |  | String
| *datasetId* | *Required* BigQuery Dataset Id |  | String
| *tableId* | BigQuery table id |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (5 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *connectionFactory* (producer) | ConnectionFactory to obtain connection to Bigquery Service. If non provided the default one will be used |  | GoogleBigQueryConnectionFactory
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *useAsInsertId* (producer) | Field name to use as insert id |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Message Headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description
|`CamelGoogleBigQueryTableSuffix` |`String` |Table suffix to use when inserting data
|`CamelGoogleBigQueryInsertId` |`String` |InsertId to use when inserting data
|`CamelGoogleBigQueryPartitionDecorator` |`String` |Partition decorator to indicate partition to use when inserting data
|`CamelGoogleBigQueryTableId` |`String` |Table id where data will be submitted. If specified will override endpoint configuration
|=======================================================================


== Producer Endpoints

Producer endpoints can accept and deliver to BigQuery individual and grouped
exchanges alike. Grouped exchanges have `Exchange.GROUPED_EXCHANGE` property set.

Google BigQuery producer will send a grouped exchange in a single api call unless different table suffix or
partition decorators are specified in which case it will break it down to ensure data is written with the
correct suffix or partition decorator.

Google BigQuery endpoint expects the payload to be either a map or list of maps. A payload containing a map
will insert a single row and a payload containing a list of map's will insert a row for each entry in the list.

== Template tables

Reference: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery#template-tables

Templated tables can be specified using the `GoogleBigQueryConstants.TABLE_SUFFIX` header.

I.e. the following route will create tables and insert records sharded on a per day basis:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
  .header(GoogleBigQueryConstants.TABLE_SUFFIX, "_${date:now:yyyyMMdd}")
  .to("google-bigquery:sampleDataset:sampleTable")
------------------------------------------------------
Note it is recommended to use partitioning for this use case.

== Partitioning

Reference: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/creating-partitioned-tables

Partitioning is specified when creating a table and if set data will be automatically partitioned into
separate tables. When inserting data a specific partition can be specified by setting the
`GoogleBigQueryConstants.PARTITION_DECORATOR` header on the exchange.

== Ensuring data consistency

Reference: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery#dataconsistency

A insert id can be set on the exchange with the header `GoogleBigQueryConstants.INSERT_ID` or by specifying
query parameter `useAsInsertId`. As an insert id need to be specified per row inserted the exchange header can't
be used when the payload is a list - if the payload is a list the `GoogleBigQueryConstants.INSERT_ID` will
be ignored. In that case use the query parameter `useAsInsertId`.
