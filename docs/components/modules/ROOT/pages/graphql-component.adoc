*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The GraphQL component is a GraphQL client that communicates over HTTP and supports queries and mutations, but not subscriptions. It uses the https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/index.html[Apache HttpClient] library.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-graphql</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== GraphQL Endpoint URI

// endpoint options: START
The GraphQL endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
graphql:httpUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *httpUri* | *Required* The GraphQL server URI. |  | URI
|===


=== Query Parameters (11 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operationName* (producer) | The query or mutation name. |  | String
| *proxyHost* (producer) | The proxy host in the format hostname:port. |  | String
| *query* (producer) | The query text. |  | String
| *queryFile* (producer) | The query file name located in the classpath. |  | String
| *variables* (producer) | The JsonObject instance containing the operation variables. |  | JsonObject
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *accessToken* (security) | The access token sent in the Authorization header. |  | String
| *jwtAuthorizationType* (security) | The JWT Authorization type. Default is Bearer. | Bearer | String
| *password* (security) | The password for Basic authentication. |  | String
| *username* (security) | The username for Basic authentication. |  | String
|===

== GraphQL Component Options

// component options: START
The GraphQL component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

== Message Body

Camel will store the GraphQL response from the external server on the OUT message body. All headers from the IN message will be copied to the OUT message, so headers are preserved during routing. Additionally Camel will add the HTTP response headers as well to the OUT message headers.

== Examples

=== Queries

Simple queries can be defined directly in the URI:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("graphql://http://example.com/graphql?query={books{id name}}")
----

More complex queries can be stored in a file and referenced in the URI:

[source,java]
----
# booksQuery.graphql
query Books {
  books {
    id
    name
  }
}

from("direct:start")
    .to("graphql://http://example.com/graphql?queryFile=booksQuery.graphql")
----

When the query file defines multiple operations, it's required to specify which one should be executed:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("graphql://http://example.com/graphql?queryFile=multipleQueries.graphql&operationName=Books")
----

Queries with variables need to reference a JsonObject instance from the registry:

[source,java]
----
@BindToRegistry("bookByIdQueryVariables")
public JsonObject bookByIdQueryVariables() {
    JsonObject variables = new JsonObject();
    variables.put("id", "book-1");
    return variables;
}

from("direct:start")
    .to("graphql://http://example.com/graphql?queryFile=bookByIdQuery.graphql&variables=#bookByIdQueryVariables")
----

=== Mutations

Mutations are like queries with variables. They specify a query and a reference to a variables bean:

[source,java]
----
# addBookMutation.graphql
mutation AddBook($bookInput: BookInput) {
  addBook(bookInput: $bookInput) {
    id
    name
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}

@BindToRegistry("addBookMutationVariables")
public JsonObject addBookMutationVariables() {
    JsonObject bookInput = new JsonObject();
    bookInput.put("name", "Typee");
    bookInput.put("authorId", "author-2");
    JsonObject variables = new JsonObject();
    variables.put("bookInput", bookInput);
    return variables;
}

from("direct:start")
    .to("graphql://http://example.com/graphql?graphql?queryFile=addBookMutation.graphql&variables=#addBookMutationVariables")
