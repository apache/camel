*Since Camel 3.0*

The microprofile-config component is used for bridging the Eclipse MicroProfile Config with Camels
properties component. This allows to use configuration management from Eclipse MicroProfile with Camel.

To enable this just add this component to the classpath and Camel should auto-detect this when starting up.

== Register manually

You can also register the microprofile-config component manually with Apache Camel properties component as shown below:

[source,java]
----
    PropertiesComponent pc = (PropertiesComponent) camelContext.getPropertiesComponent();
    pc.addPropertiesSource(new CamelMicroProfilePropertiesSource());
----
