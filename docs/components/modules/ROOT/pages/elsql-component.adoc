:page-source: components/camel-elsql/src/main/docs/elsql-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.16*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The ELSQL component is an extension to the existing
xref:sql-component.adoc[SQL Component] that uses
https://github.com/OpenGamma/ElSql[ElSql] to define the SQL queries. 

This component uses `spring-jdbc` behind the scenes for the actual SQL
handling.

This component can be used as a
http://camel.apache.org/transactional-client.html[Transactional Client].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-elsql</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

The SQL component uses the following endpoint URI notation:

[source,text]
----
sql:elSqlName:resourceUri[?options]
----

You can append query options to the URI in the following
format, `?option=value&option=value&...`

The parameters to the SQL queries are named parameters in the elsql
mapping files, and maps to corresponding keys from the Camel message, in
the given precedence:

1. from message body if xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple]
expression.

2. from message body if its a `java.util.Map`

3. from message headers

If a named parameter cannot be resolved, then an exception is thrown.

== Options

// component options: START
The ElSQL component supports 7 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *databaseVendor* (common) | To use a vendor specific com.opengamma.elsql.ElSqlConfig. The value can be one of: Default, Postgres, HSql, MySql, Oracle, SqlServer2008, Veritca |  | ElSqlDatabaseVendor
| *dataSource* (common) | Sets the DataSource to use to communicate with the database. |  | DataSource
| *resourceUri* (common) | The resource file which contains the elsql SQL statements to use. You can specify multiple resources separated by comma. The resources are loaded on the classpath by default, you can prefix with file: to load from file system. Notice you can set this option on the component and then you do not have to configure this on the endpoint. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *elSqlConfig* (advanced) | To use a specific configured ElSqlConfig. It may be better to use the databaseVendor option instead. |  | ElSqlConfig

// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The ElSQL endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
elsql:elsqlName:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *elsqlName* | *Required* The name of the elsql to use (is NAMED in the elsql file) |  | String
| *resourceUri* | The resource file which contains the elsql SQL statements to use. You can specify multiple resources separated by comma. The resources are loaded on the classpath by default, you can prefix with file: to load from file system. Notice you can set this option on the component and then you do not have to configure this on the endpoint. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (50 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *allowNamedParameters* (common) | Whether to allow using named parameters in the queries. | true | boolean
| *databaseVendor* (common) | To use a vendor specific com.opengamma.elsql.ElSqlConfig. The value can be one of: Default, Postgres, HSql, MySql, Oracle, SqlServer2008, Veritca |  | ElSqlDatabaseVendor
| *dataSource* (common) | Sets the DataSource to use to communicate with the database. |  | DataSource

| *outputClass* (common) | Specify the full package and class name to use as conversion when outputType=SelectOne. |  | String
| *outputHeader* (common) | Store the query result in a header instead of the message body. By default, outputHeader == null and the query result is stored in the message body, any existing content in the message body is discarded. If outputHeader is set, the value is used as the name of the header to store the query result and the original message body is preserved. |  | String
| *outputType* (common) | Make the output of consumer or producer to SelectList as List of Map, or SelectOne as single Java object in the following way: a) If the query has only single column, then that JDBC Column object is returned. (such as SELECT COUNT( ) FROM PROJECT will return a Long object. b) If the query has more than one column, then it will return a Map of that result. c) If the outputClass is set, then it will convert the query result into an Java bean object by calling all the setters that match the column names. It will assume your class has a default constructor to create instance with. d) If the query resulted in more than one rows, it throws an non-unique result exception. StreamList streams the result of the query using an Iterator. This can be used with the Splitter EIP in streaming mode to process the ResultSet in streaming fashion. The value can be one of: SelectOne, SelectList, StreamList | SelectList | SqlOutputType

| *onConsumeBatchComplete* (consumer) | After processing the entire batch, this query can be executed to bulk update rows etc. The query cannot have parameters. |  | String
| *onConsumeFailed* (consumer) | After processing each row then this query can be executed, if the Exchange failed, for example to mark the row as failed. The query can have parameter. |  | String
| *routeEmptyResultSet* (consumer) | Sets whether empty resultset should be allowed to be sent to the next hop. Defaults to false. So the empty resultset will be filtered out. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *transacted* (consumer) | Enables or disables transaction. If enabled then if processing an exchange failed then the consumer breaks out processing any further exchanges to cause a rollback eager. | false | boolean
| *useIterator* (consumer) | Sets how resultset should be delivered to route. Indicates delivery as either a list or individual object. defaults to true. | true | boolean

| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *noop* (producer) | If set, will ignore the results of the SQL query and use the existing IN message as the OUT message for the continuation of processing | false | boolean
| *useMessageBodyForSql* (producer) | Whether to use the message body as the SQL and then headers for parameters. If this option is enabled then the SQL in the uri is not used. Note that query parameters in the message body are represented by a question mark instead of a # symbol. | false | boolean
| *alwaysPopulateStatement* (advanced) | If enabled then the populateStatement method from org.apache.camel.component.sql.SqlPrepareStatementStrategy is always invoked, also if there is no expected parameters to be prepared. When this is false then the populateStatement is only invoked if there is 1 or more expected parameters to be set; for example this avoids reading the message body/headers for SQL queries with no parameters. | false | boolean

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long

== Result of the query

For `select` operations, the result is an instance of
`List<Map<String, Object>>` type, as returned by the
JdbcTemplate.queryForList() method. For `update` operations, the result
is the number of updated rows, returned as an `Integer`.

By default, the result is placed in the message body.  If the
outputHeader parameter is set, the result is placed in the header.  This
is an alternative to using a full message enrichment pattern to add
headers, it provides a concise syntax for querying a sequence or some
other small value into a header.  It is convenient to use outputHeader
and outputType together:

== Header values

When performing `update` operations, the SQL Component stores the update
count in the following message headers:

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|===
|Header |Description

|`CamelSqlUpdateCount` |The number of rows updated for `update` operations, returned as an
`Integer` object.

|`CamelSqlRowCount` |The number of rows returned for `select` operations, returned as an
`Integer` object.
|===

=== Sample

In the given route below, we want to get all the projects from the
projects table. Notice the SQL query has 2 named parameters, :#lic and
:#min.

Camel will then lookup for these parameters from the message body or
message headers. Notice in the example above we set two headers with
constant value +
 for the named parameters:

[source,java]
----
   from("direct:projects")
     .setHeader("lic", constant("ASF"))
     .setHeader("min", constant(123))
     .to("elsql:projects:com/foo/orders.elsql")
----

And the https://github.com/OpenGamma/ElSql[elsql] mapping file

[source,sql]
----
@NAME(projects)
  SELECT *
  FROM projects
  WHERE license = :lic AND id > :min
  ORDER BY id
----

Though if the message body is a `java.util.Map` then the named
parameters will be taken from the body.

[source,java]
----
   from("direct:projects")
     .to("elsql:projects:com/foo/orders.elsql")
----

== Using expression parameters in producers

In from Camel 2.16.1 onwards you can use Simple expressions as well,
which allows to use an OGNL like notation on the message body, where it
assumes to have `getLicense` and `getMinimum` methods:

[source,sql]
----
@NAME(projects)
  SELECT *
  FROM projects
  WHERE license = :${body.license} AND id > :${body.minimum}
  ORDER BY id
----

=== Using expression parameters in consumers

*Since Camel 2.23*

When using the ElSql component as consumer, you can now also use expression parameters (simple language)
to build dynamic query parameters, such as calling a method on a bean to retrieve an id, date or something.

For example in the sample below we call the nextId method on the bean myIdGenerator:

[source,sql]
----
@NAME(projectsByIdBean)
  SELECT *
  FROM projects
  WHERE id = :${bean#myIdGenerator.nextId}
----

IMPORTANT: Notice in the bean syntax above, we must use `#` instead of `:` in the simple expression.
This is because Spring query parameter parser is in-use which will separate parameters on colon.
Also pay attention that Spring query parser will invoke the bean twice for each query.

And the bean has the following method:

[source,java]
----
public static class MyIdGenerator {

    private int id = 1;

    public int nextId() {
        // spring will call this twice, one for initializing query and 2nd for actual value
        id++;
        return id / 2;
    }
----

Notice that there is no existing `Exchange` with message body and headers, so
the simple expression you can use in the consumer are most useable for calling
bean methods as in this example.
