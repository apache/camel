:description: Solve planning problems with OptaPlanner.
:since: 2.13
:supportLevel: Stable
:component-header: Both producer and consumer are supported
include::{cq-version}@camel-quarkus:ROOT:partial$reference/components/optaplanner.adoc[opts=optional]

*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Optaplanner component solves the planning problem contained in a
message with http://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner]. +
 For example: feed it an unsolved Vehicle Routing problem and it solves
it.

The component supports consumer as BestSolutionChangedEvent listener and
producer for processing Solution and ProblemFactChange

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-optaplanner</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version><!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
----------------------------------
optaplanner:solverConfig[?options]
----------------------------------

The *solverConfig* is the classpath-local URI of the solverConfig, for
example `/org/foo/barSolverConfig.xml`.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== OptaPlanner Options


// component options: START
The OptaPlanner component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The OptaPlanner endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
optaplanner:configFile
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configFile* | *Required* Specifies the location to the solver file. If useSolverManager=FALSE, Camel uses this file and create the Solver. If useSolverManager=TRUE and SolverManager is set in the header {OptaPlannerConstants.SOLVER_MANAGER} : this file is ignored by Camel usage of SolverManager. SolverManager can be injected by DI in Quarkus or Spring. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (10 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *problemId* (common) | In case of using SolverManager : the problem id | 1L | Long
| *solverId* (common) | Specifies the solverId to user for the solver instance key | DEFAULT_SOLVER | String
| *useSolverManager* (common) | use SolverManager instead of XML file config. Use this mode on Quarkus app. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *async* (producer) | Specifies to perform operations in async mode | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *threadPoolSize* (producer) | Specifies the thread pool size to use when async is true | 10 | int
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END



== Message Headers

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,10%,10%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Type |Context |Description

|CamelOptaPlannerSolverId |null |String |Shared |Specifies the solverId to use

|CamelOptaPlannerIsAsync |PUT |String |Producer |Specify whether to use another thread for submitting Solution instances
rather than blocking the current thread.
|=======================================================================

== Message Body

Camel takes the planning problem for the IN body, solves it and returns
it on the OUT body. The IN body object supports the following use cases:

* If the body is instance of Solution, then it will be solved using the
solver identified by solverId and either synchronously or
asynchronously.
* If the body is instance of ProblemFactChange, then it will trigger
addProblemFactChange. If the processing is asynchronously, then it will
wait till isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed before returning result.
* If the body is none of the above types, then the producer will return
the best result from the solver identified by solverId

== Termination

The solving will take as long as specified in the `solverConfig`.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<solver>
  ...
  <termination>
    <!-- Terminate after 10 seconds, unless it's not feasible by then yet -->
    <terminationCompositionStyle>AND</terminationCompositionStyle>
    <secondsSpentLimit>10</secondsSpentLimit>
    <bestScoreLimit>-1hard/0soft</bestScoreLimit>
  </termination>
  ...
<solver>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

=== Samples

Solve an planning problem that's on the ActiveMQ queue with OptaPlanner:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  .to("optaplanner:/org/foo/barSolverConfig.xml");
--------------------------------------------------

Expose OptaPlanner as a REST service:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
from("cxfrs:bean:rsServer?bindingStyle=SimpleConsumer")
  .to("optaplanner:/org/foo/barSolverConfig.xml");
-------------------------------------------------------
