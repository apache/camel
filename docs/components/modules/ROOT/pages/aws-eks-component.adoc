*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The EKS component supports create, delete, describe and list
https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[AWS EKS] clusters instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon EKS. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon EKS].

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws-eks://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) component supports 12 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoDiscoverClient* (common) | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *configuration* (producer) | The component configuration |  | EKSConfiguration
| *eksClient* (producer) | To use a existing configured AWS EKS as client |  | AmazonEKS
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of: listClusters, describeCluster, createCluster, deleteCluster |  | EKSOperations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the EKS client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the EKS client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the EKS client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which EKS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *secretKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-eks:label
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *label* | *Required* Logical name |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (11 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoDiscoverClient* (common) | Setting the autoDiscoverClient mechanism, if true, the component will look for a client instance in the registry automatically otherwise it will skip that checking. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *eksClient* (producer) | To use a existing configured AWS EKS as client |  | AmazonEKS
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message).

| *region* (producer) | The region in which EKS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String
| *secretKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END




Required EKS component options

You have to provide the amazonEKSClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon EKS] service.

== Usage

=== Message headers evaluated by the EKS producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsEKSMaxResults` |`Integer` |The limit number of results while listing clusters

|`CamelAwsEKSOperation` |`String` |The operation we want to perform

|`CamelAwsEKSDescription` |`String` |A key description to use while performing a createKey operation

|`CamelAwsEKSClusterName` |`String` |The cluster name

|`CamelAwsEKSRoleARN` |`String` |The role ARN to use while creating the cluster

|`CamelAwsEKSVPCConfig` |`VPCConfigRequest` |The VPC config for the creations of an EKS cluster
|=======================================================================

=== EKS Producer operations

Camel-AWS EKS component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listClusters
- createCluster
- describeCluster
- deleteCluster

== Producer Examples

- listClusters: this operation will list the available clusters in EKS

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listClusters")
    .to("aws-eks://test?ecsClient=#amazonEksClient&operation=listClusters")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Automatic detection of AmazonEKS client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonEKS bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-eks</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
