= AWS SimpleDB Component
:page-source: components/camel-aws-sdb/src/main/docs/aws-sdb-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.9*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The sdb component supports storing and retrieving data from/to
https://aws.amazon.com/sdb[Amazon's SDB] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon SDB. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/sdb[Amazon SDB].

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws-sdb://domainName[?options]
------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS SimpleDB component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The AWS SimpleDB endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-sdb:domainName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *domainName* | *Required* The name of the domain currently worked with. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (13 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *accessKey* (producer) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String

| *consistentRead* (producer) | Determines whether or not strong consistency should be enforced when data is read. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean

| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the SDB client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the SDB client. The value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which SDB client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() |  | String

|===
// endpoint options: END




Required SDB component options

You have to provide the amazonSDBClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/sdb[Amazon's SDB].

=== Advanced AmazonSimpleDB configuration

If you need more control over the `AmazonSimpleDB` instance
configuration you can create your own instance and refer to it from the
URI:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("aws-sdb://domainName?amazonSDBClient=#client");
----------------------------------------------------

The `#client` refers to a `AmazonSimpleDB` in the
Registry.

For example if your Camel Application is running behind a firewall:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("myAccessKey", "mySecretKey");
ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfiguration.setProxyHost("http://myProxyHost");
clientConfiguration.setProxyPort(8080);

AmazonSimpleDB client = new AmazonSimpleDBClient(awsCredentials, clientConfiguration);

registry.bind("client", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== SDB Producer operations

Camel-AWS SDB component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- BatchDeleteAttributes
- BatchPutAttributes
- DeleteAttributes
- DeleteDomain
- DomainMetadata
- GetAttributes
- ListDomains
- PutAttributes
- Select

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws-sdb</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version\}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
