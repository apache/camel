:page-source: components/camel-apns/src/main/docs/apns-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.8*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The APNS component is used for sending notifications to iOS devices.
The APNS components use https://github.com/notnoop/java-apns[javapns]
library. +
 The component supports sending notifications to Apple Push Notification
Servers (APNS) and consuming feedback from the servers.

The consumer is configured with 3600 seconds for polling by default
because it is a best practice to consume feedback stream from Apple Push
Notification Servers only from time to time. For example: every 1 hour
to avoid flooding the servers.

The feedback stream gives informations about inactive devices. You only
need to get this informations every some hours if your mobile
application is not a heavily used one.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-apns</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

To send notifications:

[source,java]
---------------------
apns:notify[?options]
---------------------

To consume feedback:

[source,java]
-----------------------
apns:consumer[?options]
-----------------------

== Options



// component options: START
The APNS component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apnsService* (common) | *Required* The ApnsService to use. The org.apache.camel.component.apns.factory.ApnsServiceFactory can be used to build a ApnsService |  | ApnsService
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The APNS endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
apns:name
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *name* | Name of the endpoint |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (23 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *tokens* (common) | Configure this property in case you want to statically declare tokens related to devices you want to notify. Tokens are separated by comma. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. | 1000 | long
| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. The value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel
| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutorService
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component. The value can be one of: none, spring, quartz | none | String
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map
| *startScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | boolean
| *timeUnit* (scheduler) | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. The value can be one of: NANOSECONDS, MICROSECONDS, MILLISECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit
| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END



You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

=== Component

The `ApnsComponent` must be configured with a
`com.notnoop.apns.ApnsService`. The service can be created and
configured using the
`org.apache.camel.component.apns.factory.ApnsServiceFactory`. See
further below for an example. And as well in the
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components/camel-apns[test
source code].

==== SSL Setting
In order to use secure connection, an instance of `org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters`
 should be injected to `org.apache.camel.component.apns.factory.ApnsServiceFactory` which is
 used to configure the component. See the test resources for an example.
 https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-apns/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/apns/spring/SpringApnsConsumerTest-context.xml[ssl example]

== Exchange data format

When Camel will fetch feedback data corresponding to inactive devices,
it will retrieve a List of InactiveDevice objects. Each InactiveDevice
object of the retrieved list will be setted as the In body, and then
processed by the consumer endpoint.

== Message Headers

Camel Apns uses these headers.

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Default |Description
|`CamelApnsTokens` | |Empty by default.
|`CamelApnsMessageType` |`STRING, PAYLOAD, APNS_NOTIFICATION`  |In case you choose PAYLOAD for the message type, then the message will
be considered as a APNS payload and sent as is. In case you choose
STRING, message will be converted as a APNS payload. From *Camel 2.16*
onwards APNS_NOTIFICATION is used for sending message body as
com.notnoop.apns.ApnsNotification types.
|=======================================================================

== ApnsServiceFactory builder callback

`ApnsServiceFactory` comes with the empty callback method that could be
used to configure (or even replace) the default `ApnsServiceBuilder`
instance. The signature of the method could look as follows:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
protected ApnsServiceBuilder configureServiceBuilder(ApnsServiceBuilder serviceBuilder);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And could be used like as follows:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ApnsServiceFactory proxiedApnsServiceFactory = new ApnsServiceFactory(){
  
  @Override
  protected ApnsServiceBuilder configureServiceBuilder(ApnsServiceBuilder serviceBuilder) {
    return serviceBuilder.withSocksProxy("my.proxy.com", 6666);
  }

};
