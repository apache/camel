*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Debezium MySQL component is wrapper around https://debezium.io/[Debezium] using https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html[Debezium Embedded], which enables Change Data Capture from MySQL database using Debezium without the need for Kafka or Kafka Connect.

*Note on handling failures:* Per https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html#_handling_failures[Debezium Embedded Engine] documentation, the engines is actively recording source offsets and periodically flushes these offsets to a persistent storage, so when the application is restarted or crashed, the engine will resume from the last recorded offset.
Thus, at normal operation, your downstream routes will receive each event exactly once, however in case of an application crash (not having a graceful shutdown), the application will resume from the last recorded offset,
which may result in receiving duplicate events immediately after the restart. Therefore, your downstream routes should be tolerant enough of such case and deduplicate events if needed.

*Note:* The Debezium MySQL component is currently not supported in OSGi

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component.

| *databaseServerIdOffset* (mysql) | Only relevant if parallel snapshotting is configured. During parallel snapshotting, multiple (4) connections open to the database client, and they each need their own unique connection ID. This offset is used to generate those IDs from the base configured cluster ID. | 10000 | long

| *eventProcessingFailureHandling{zwsp}Mode* (mysql) | Specify how failures during processing of events (i.e. when encountering a corrupted event) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'ignore' the problematic event will be skipped. | fail | String
| *gtidNewChannelPosition* (mysql) | If set to 'latest', when connector sees new GTID, it will start consuming gtid channel from the server latest executed gtid position. If 'earliest' (the default) connector starts reading channel from first available (not purged) gtid position on the server. | earliest | String

| *gtidSourceIncludes* (mysql) | The source UUIDs used to include GTID ranges when determine the starting position in the MySQL server's binlog. |  | String
| *heartbeatIntervalMs* (mysql) | Length of an interval in milli-seconds in in which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. Use 0 to disable heartbeat messages. Disabled by default. | 0ms | int
| *heartbeatTopicsPrefix* (mysql) | The prefix that is used to name heartbeat topics.Defaults to __debezium-heartbeat. | __debezium-heartbeat | String
| *includeQuery* (mysql) | Whether the connector should include the original SQL query that generated the change event. Note: This option requires MySQL be configured with the binlog_rows_query_log_events option set to ON. Query will not be present for events generated from snapshot. WARNING: Enabling this option may expose tables or fields explicitly blacklisted or masked by including the original SQL statement in the change event. For this reason the default value is 'false'. | false | boolean
| *includeSchemaChanges* (mysql) | Whether the connector should publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID. Each schema change will be recorded using a key that contains the database name and whose value include logical description of the new schema and optionally the DDL statement(s).The default is 'true'. This is independent of how the connector internally records database history. | true | boolean
| *inconsistentSchemaHandlingMode* (mysql) | Specify how binlog events that belong to a table missing from internal schema representation (i.e. internal representation is not consistent with database) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its binlog position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its binlog position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'skip' the problematic event will be skipped. | fail | String
| *maxBatchSize* (mysql) | Maximum size of each batch of source records. Defaults to 2048. | 2048 | int
| *maxQueueSize* (mysql) | Maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. Defaults to 8192, and should always be larger than the maximum batch size. | 8192 | int
| *messageKeyColumns* (mysql) | A semicolon-separated list of expressions that match fully-qualified tables and column(s) to be used as message key. Each expression must match the pattern ':',where the table names could be defined as (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector,and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. For any table without an explicit key configuration the table's primary key column(s) will be used as message key.Example: dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id |  | String
| *pollIntervalMs* (mysql) | Frequency in milliseconds to wait for new change events to appear after receiving no events. Defaults to 500ms. | 500ms | long
| *skippedOperations* (mysql) | The comma-separated list of operations to skip during streaming, defined as: 'i' for inserts; 'u' for updates; 'd' for deletes. By default, no operations will be skipped. |  | String
| *snapshotDelayMs* (mysql) | The number of milliseconds to delay before a snapshot will begin. | 0ms | long
| *snapshotFetchSize* (mysql) | The maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while performing a snapshot |  | int
| *snapshotLockingMode* (mysql) | Controls how long the connector holds onto the global read lock while it is performing a snapshot. The default is 'minimal', which means the connector holds the global read lock (and thus prevents any updates) for just the initial portion of the snapshot while the database schemas and other metadata are being read. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this can be done using the snapshot process' REPEATABLE READ transaction even when the lock is no longer held and other operations are updating the database. However, in some cases it may be desirable to block all writes for the entire duration of the snapshot; in such cases set this property to 'extended'. Using a value of 'none' will prevent the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot process. This mode can only be used in combination with snapshot.mode values of 'schema_only' or 'schema_only_recovery' and is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken. | minimal | String
| *snapshotMode* (mysql) | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'when_needed' to specify that the connector run a snapshot upon startup whenever it deems it necessary; 'schema_only' to only take a snapshot of the schema (table structures) but no actual data; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally read the binlog; and'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the beginning of the binlog. The 'never' mode should be used with care, and only when the binlog is known to contain all history. | initial | String
| *snapshotNewTables* (mysql) | BETA FEATURE: On connector restart, the connector will check if there have been any new tables added to the configuration, and snapshot them. There is presently only two options:'off': Default behavior. Do not snapshot new tables.'parallel': The snapshot of the new tables will occur in parallel to the continued binlog reading of the old tables. When the snapshot completes, an independent binlog reader will begin reading the events for the new tables until it catches up to present time. At this point, both old and new binlog readers will be momentarily halted and new binlog reader will start that will read the binlog for all configured tables. The parallel binlog reader will have a configured server id of 10000 the primary binlog reader's server id. | off | String
| *snapshotSelectStatement{zwsp}Overrides* (mysql) | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *sourceStructVersion* (mysql) | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String
| *tableBlacklist* (mysql) | A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring (deprecated, use table.exclude.list instead) |  | String
| *tableExcludeList* (mysql) | A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring |  | String
| *tableIgnoreBuiltin* (mysql) | Flag specifying whether built-in tables should be ignored. | true | boolean
| *tableIncludeList* (mysql) | The tables for which changes are to be captured |  | String
| *tableWhitelist* (mysql) | The tables for which changes are to be captured (deprecated, use table.include.list instead) |  | String
| *timePrecisionMode* (mysql) | Time, date and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive_time_microseconds': the precision of date and timestamp values is based the database column's precision; but time fields always use microseconds precision;'connect': always represents time, date and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision. | adaptive_time_microseconds | String
| *tombstonesOnDelete* (mysql) | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | boolean

This connector joins the MySQL database cluster as another server (with this unique ID) so it can read the binlog. By default, a random number is generated between 5400 and 6400. |  | long
| *databaseServerIdOffset* (mysql) | Only relevant if parallel snapshotting is configured. During parallel snapshotting, multiple (4) connections open to the database client, and they each need their own unique connection ID. This offset is used to generate those IDs from the base configured cluster ID. | 10000 | long

| *databaseSslMode* (mysql) | Whether to use an encrypted connection to MySQL. Options include'disabled' (the default) to use an unencrypted connection; 'preferred' to establish a secure (encrypted) connection if the server supports secure connections, but fall back to an unencrypted connection otherwise; 'required' to use a secure (encrypted) connection, and fail if one cannot be established; 'verify_ca' like 'required' but additionally verify the server TLS certificate against the configured Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, or fail if no valid matching CA certificates are found; or'verify_identity' like 'verify_ca' but additionally verify that the server certificate matches the host to which the connection is attempted. | disabled | String

| *databaseSslTruststorePassword* (mysql) | Password to unlock the keystore file (store password) specified by 'ssl.trustore' configuration property or the 'javax.net.ssl.trustStore' system or JVM property. |  | String
| *databaseUser* (mysql) | Name of the MySQL database user to be used when connecting to the database. |  | String
| *decimalHandlingMode* (mysql) | Specify how DECIMAL and NUMERIC columns should be represented in change events, including:'precise' (the default) uses java.math.BigDecimal to represent values, which are encoded in the change events using a binary representation and Kafka Connect's 'org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Decimal' type; 'string' uses string to represent values; 'double' represents values using Java's 'double', which may not offer the precision but will be far easier to use in consumers. | precise | String
| *enableTimeAdjuster* (mysql) | MySQL allows user to insert year value as either 2-digit or 4-digit. In case of two digit the value is automatically mapped into 1970 - 2069.false - delegates the implicit conversion to the databasetrue - (the default) Debezium makes the conversion | true | boolean
| *eventDeserializationFailure{zwsp}HandlingMode* (mysql) | Specify how failures during deserialization of binlog events (i.e. when encountering a corrupted event) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its binlog position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its binlog position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'ignore' the problematic event will be skipped. | fail | String
| *eventProcessingFailureHandling{zwsp}Mode* (mysql) | Specify how failures during processing of events (i.e. when encountering a corrupted event) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'ignore' the problematic event will be skipped. | fail | String
| *gtidNewChannelPosition* (mysql) | If set to 'latest', when connector sees new GTID, it will start consuming gtid channel from the server latest executed gtid position. If 'earliest' (the default) connector starts reading channel from first available (not purged) gtid position on the server. | earliest | String
| *gtidSourceExcludes* (mysql) | The source UUIDs used to exclude GTID ranges when determine the starting position in the MySQL server's binlog. |  | String
| *gtidSourceFilterDmlEvents* (mysql) | If set to true, we will only produce DML events into Kafka for transactions that were written on mysql servers with UUIDs matching the filters defined by the gtid.source.includes or gtid.source.excludes configuration options, if they are specified. | true | boolean
| *gtidSourceIncludes* (mysql) | The source UUIDs used to include GTID ranges when determine the starting position in the MySQL server's binlog. |  | String
| *heartbeatIntervalMs* (mysql) | Length of an interval in milli-seconds in in which the connector periodically sends heartbeat messages to a heartbeat topic. Use 0 to disable heartbeat messages. Disabled by default. | 0ms | int
| *heartbeatTopicsPrefix* (mysql) | The prefix that is used to name heartbeat topics.Defaults to __debezium-heartbeat. | __debezium-heartbeat | String
| *includeQuery* (mysql) | Whether the connector should include the original SQL query that generated the change event. Note: This option requires MySQL be configured with the binlog_rows_query_log_events option set to ON. Query will not be present for events generated from snapshot. WARNING: Enabling this option may expose tables or fields explicitly blacklisted or masked by including the original SQL statement in the change event. For this reason the default value is 'false'. | false | boolean
| *includeSchemaChanges* (mysql) | Whether the connector should publish changes in the database schema to a Kafka topic with the same name as the database server ID. Each schema change will be recorded using a key that contains the database name and whose value include logical description of the new schema and optionally the DDL statement(s).The default is 'true'. This is independent of how the connector internally records database history. | true | boolean
| *inconsistentSchemaHandlingMode* (mysql) | Specify how binlog events that belong to a table missing from internal schema representation (i.e. internal representation is not consistent with database) should be handled, including:'fail' (the default) an exception indicating the problematic event and its binlog position is raised, causing the connector to be stopped; 'warn' the problematic event and its binlog position will be logged and the event will be skipped;'skip' the problematic event will be skipped. | fail | String
| *maxBatchSize* (mysql) | Maximum size of each batch of source records. Defaults to 2048. | 2048 | int
| *maxQueueSize* (mysql) | Maximum size of the queue for change events read from the database log but not yet recorded or forwarded. Defaults to 8192, and should always be larger than the maximum batch size. | 8192 | int
| *messageKeyColumns* (mysql) | A semicolon-separated list of expressions that match fully-qualified tables and column(s) to be used as message key. Each expression must match the pattern ':',where the table names could be defined as (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on the specific connector,and the key columns are a comma-separated list of columns representing the custom key. For any table without an explicit key configuration the table's primary key column(s) will be used as message key.Example: dbserver1.inventory.orderlines:orderId,orderLineId;dbserver1.inventory.orders:id |  | String
| *pollIntervalMs* (mysql) | Frequency in milliseconds to wait for new change events to appear after receiving no events. Defaults to 500ms. | 500ms | long
| *skippedOperations* (mysql) | The comma-separated list of operations to skip during streaming, defined as: 'i' for inserts; 'u' for updates; 'd' for deletes. By default, no operations will be skipped. |  | String
| *snapshotDelayMs* (mysql) | The number of milliseconds to delay before a snapshot will begin. | 0ms | long
| *snapshotFetchSize* (mysql) | The maximum number of records that should be loaded into memory while performing a snapshot |  | int
| *snapshotLockingMode* (mysql) | Controls how long the connector holds onto the global read lock while it is performing a snapshot. The default is 'minimal', which means the connector holds the global read lock (and thus prevents any updates) for just the initial portion of the snapshot while the database schemas and other metadata are being read. The remaining work in a snapshot involves selecting all rows from each table, and this can be done using the snapshot process' REPEATABLE READ transaction even when the lock is no longer held and other operations are updating the database. However, in some cases it may be desirable to block all writes for the entire duration of the snapshot; in such cases set this property to 'extended'. Using a value of 'none' will prevent the connector from acquiring any table locks during the snapshot process. This mode can only be used in combination with snapshot.mode values of 'schema_only' or 'schema_only_recovery' and is only safe to use if no schema changes are happening while the snapshot is taken. | minimal | String
| *snapshotMode* (mysql) | The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Options include: 'when_needed' to specify that the connector run a snapshot upon startup whenever it deems it necessary; 'schema_only' to only take a snapshot of the schema (table structures) but no actual data; 'initial' (the default) to specify the connector can run a snapshot only when no offsets are available for the logical server name; 'initial_only' same as 'initial' except the connector should stop after completing the snapshot and before it would normally read the binlog; and'never' to specify the connector should never run a snapshot and that upon first startup the connector should read from the beginning of the binlog. The 'never' mode should be used with care, and only when the binlog is known to contain all history. | initial | String
| *snapshotNewTables* (mysql) | BETA FEATURE: On connector restart, the connector will check if there have been any new tables added to the configuration, and snapshot them. There is presently only two options:'off': Default behavior. Do not snapshot new tables.'parallel': The snapshot of the new tables will occur in parallel to the continued binlog reading of the old tables. When the snapshot completes, an independent binlog reader will begin reading the events for the new tables until it catches up to present time. At this point, both old and new binlog readers will be momentarily halted and new binlog reader will start that will read the binlog for all configured tables. The parallel binlog reader will have a configured server id of 10000 the primary binlog reader's server id. | off | String
| *snapshotSelectStatement{zwsp}Overrides* (mysql) | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. |  | String
| *sourceStructVersion* (mysql) | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | v2 | String
| *tableBlacklist* (mysql) | A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring (deprecated, use table.exclude.list instead) |  | String
| *tableExcludeList* (mysql) | A comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of tables to be excluded from monitoring |  | String
| *tableIgnoreBuiltin* (mysql) | Flag specifying whether built-in tables should be ignored. | true | boolean
| *tableIncludeList* (mysql) | The tables for which changes are to be captured |  | String
| *tableWhitelist* (mysql) | The tables for which changes are to be captured (deprecated, use table.include.list instead) |  | String
| *timePrecisionMode* (mysql) | Time, date and timestamps can be represented with different kinds of precisions, including:'adaptive_time_microseconds': the precision of date and timestamp values is based the database column's precision; but time fields always use microseconds precision;'connect': always represents time, date and timestamp values using Kafka Connect's built-in representations for Time, Date, and Timestamp, which uses millisecond precision regardless of the database columns' precision. | adaptive_time_microseconds | String
| *tombstonesOnDelete* (mysql) | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | boolean

== Message headers

=== Consumer headers

The following headers are available when consuming change events from Debezium.
[width="100%",cols="2m,2m,1m,5",options="header"]
|===
| Header constant                           | Header value                                   | Type        | Description
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_IDENTIFIER       | "CamelDebeziumIdentifier"                      | String      | The identifier of the connector, normally is this format "+++{server-name}.{database-name}.{table-name}+++".
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_KEY              | "CamelDebeziumKey"                             | Struct      | The key of the event, normally is the table Primary Key.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_SOURCE_METADATA  | "CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata"                  | Map         | The metadata about the source event, for example `table` name, database `name`, log position, etc, please refer to the Debezium documentation for more info.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_OPERATION        | "CamelDebeziumOperation"                       | String      | If presents, the type of event operation. Values for the connector are `c` for create (or insert), `u` for update, `d` for delete or `r` in case of a snapshot event.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_TIMESTAMP        | "CamelDebeziumTimestamp"                       | Long        | If presents, the time (using the system clock in the JVM) at which the connector processed the event.
| DebeziumConstants.HEADER_BEFORE           | "CamelDebeziumBefore"                          | Struct     | If presents, contains the state of the row before the event occurred.
|===

== Message body
The message body if is not `null` (in case of tombstones), it contains the state of the row after the event occurred as `Struct` format or `Map` format if you use the included Type Converter from `Struct` to `Map` (please look below for more explanation).

== Samples

=== Consuming events

Here is a very simple route that you can use in order to listen to Debezium events from MySQL connector.
[source,java]
----
from("debezium-mysql:dbz-test-1?offsetStorageFileName=/usr/offset-file-1.dat&databaseHostName=localhost&databaseUser=debezium&databasePassword=dbz&databaseServerName=my-app-connector&databaseHistoryFileName=/usr/history-file-1.dat")
    .log("Event received from Debezium : ${body}")
    .log("    with this identifier ${headers.CamelDebeziumIdentifier}")
    .log("    with these source metadata ${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata}")
    .log("    the event occured upon this operation '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceOperation}'")
    .log("    on this database '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[db]}' and this table '${headers.CamelDebeziumSourceMetadata[table]}'")
    .log("    with the key ${headers.CamelDebeziumKey}")
    .log("    the previous value is ${headers.CamelDebeziumBefore}")
----

By default, the component will emit the events in the body and `CamelDebeziumBefore` header as https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html[`Struct`] data type, the reasoning behind this, is to perceive the schema information in case is needed.
However, the component as well contains a xref:manual::type-converter.adoc[Type Converter] that converts
from default output type of https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Struct.html[`Struct`] to `Map` in order to leverage Camel's rich xref:manual::data-format.adoc[Data Format] types which many of them work out of box with `Map` data type.
To use it, you can either add `Map.class` type when you access the message e.g: `exchange.getIn().getBody(Map.class)`, or you can convert the body always to `Map` from the route builder by adding `.convertBodyTo(Map.class)` to your Camel Route DSL after `from` statement.

We mentioned above about the schema, which can be used in case you need to perform advance data transformation and the schema is needed for that. If you choose not to convert your body to `Map`,
you can obtain the schema information as https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/data/Schema.html[`Schema`] type from `Struct` like this:
[source,java]
----
from("debezium-mysql:[name]?[options]])
    .process(exchange -> {
        final Struct bodyValue = exchange.getIn().getBody(Struct.class);
        final Schema schemaValue = bodyValue.schema();

        log.info("Body value is :" + bodyValue);
        log.info("With Schema : " + schemaValue);
        log.info("And fields of :" + schemaValue.fields());
        log.info("Field name has `" + schemaValue.field("name").schema() + "` type");
    });
----

*Important Note:* This component is a thin wrapper around Debezium Engine as mentioned, therefore before using this component in production, you need to understand how Debezium works and how configurations can reflect the expected behavior, especially in regards to https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.9/operations/embedded.html#_handling_failures[handling failures].
