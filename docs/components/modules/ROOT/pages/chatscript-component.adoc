*Since Camel 3.0*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The ChatScript component allows you to interact with ChatScript Server and have conversations. This component is stateless and relies on ChatScript to maintain chat history.

Original ChatScript is available here : https://github.com/bwilcox-1234/ChatScript

This component expects a JSON having the following fields:
{
username:
botname:
body:
}

Refer ChatScriptMessage.java and samples  

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
      <artifactId>camel-chatscript</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format
[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChatScript:host:[port]/botName[?options]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Options

// component options: START
The ChatScript component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
The ChatScript endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *resetChat* (producer) | Issues :reset command to start a new conversation everytime | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
