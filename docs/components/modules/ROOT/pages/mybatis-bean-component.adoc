= MyBatis Bean Component
:page-source: components/camel-mybatis/src/main/docs/mybatis-bean-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.22*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The MyBatis Bean component allows you to query, insert, update and
delete data in a relational database using http://mybatis.org/[MyBatis] bean annotations.

This component can **only** be used as a producer. If you want to consume
from MyBatis then use the regular **mybatis** component.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-mybatis</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

This component will by default load the MyBatis SqlMapConfig file from
the root of the classpath with the expected name of
`SqlMapConfig.xml`. +
 If the file is located in another location, you will need to configure
the `configurationUri` option on the `MyBatisComponent` component.

== Options

// component options: START
The MyBatis Bean component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configurationUri* (producer) | Location of MyBatis xml configuration file. The default value is: SqlMapConfig.xml loaded from the classpath | SqlMapConfig.xml | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *sqlSessionFactory* (advanced) | To use the SqlSessionFactory |  | SqlSessionFactory
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The MyBatis Bean endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
mybatis-bean:beanName:methodName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *beanName* | *Required* Name of the bean with the MyBatis annotations. This can either by a type alias or a FQN class name. |  | String
| *methodName* | *Required* Name of the method on the bean that has the SQL query to be executed. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (6 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *executorType* (producer) | The executor type to be used while executing statements. simple - executor does nothing special. reuse - executor reuses prepared statements. batch - executor reuses statements and batches updates. The value can be one of: SIMPLE, REUSE, BATCH | SIMPLE | ExecutorType
| *inputHeader* (producer) | User the header value for input parameters instead of the message body. By default, inputHeader == null and the input parameters are taken from the message body. If outputHeader is set, the value is used and query parameters will be taken from the header instead of the body. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *outputHeader* (producer) | Store the query result in a header instead of the message body. By default, outputHeader == null and the query result is stored in the message body, any existing content in the message body is discarded. If outputHeader is set, the value is used as the name of the header to store the query result and the original message body is preserved. Setting outputHeader will also omit populating the default CamelMyBatisResult header since it would be the same as outputHeader all the time. |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END




== Message Headers

Camel will populate the result message, either IN or OUT with a header
with the statement used:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelMyBatisResult` |`Object` |The *response* returned from MtBatis in any of the operations. For
instance an `INSERT` could return the auto-generated key, or number of
rows etc.
|===

== Message Body

The response from MyBatis will only be set as the body if it's a
`SELECT` statement. That means, for example, for `INSERT` statements
Camel will not replace the body. This allows you to continue routing and
keep the original body. The response from MyBatis is always stored in
the header with the key `CamelMyBatisResult`.

== Samples

For example if you wish to consume beans from a JMS queue and insert
them into a database you could do the following:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:queue:newAccount")
  .to("mybatis-bean:AccountService:insertBeanAccount");
----

Notice we have to specify the bean name and method name, as we need to instruct
Camel which kind of operation to invoke.

Where `AccountService` is the type alias for the bean that has the MyBatis
bean annotations. You can configure type alias in the SqlMapConfig file:

[source,xml]
----
    <typeAliases>
        <typeAlias alias="Account" type="org.apache.camel.component.mybatis.Account"/>
        <typeAlias alias="AccountService" type="org.apache.camel.component.mybatis.bean.AccountService"/>
    </typeAliases>
----
[source]

On the `AccountService` bean you can declare the MyBatis mappins using annotations as shown:

[source,java]
----
public interface AccountService {

    @Select("select ACC_ID as id, ACC_FIRST_NAME as firstName, ACC_LAST_NAME as lastName"
        + ", ACC_EMAIL as emailAddress from ACCOUNT where ACC_ID = #{id}")
    Account selectBeanAccountById(@Param("id") int no);

    @Select("select * from ACCOUNT order by ACC_ID")
    @ResultMap("Account.AccountResult")
    List<Account> selectBeanAllAccounts();

    @Insert("insert into ACCOUNT (ACC_ID,ACC_FIRST_NAME,ACC_LAST_NAME,ACC_EMAIL)"
        + " values (#{id}, #{firstName}, #{lastName}, #{emailAddress})")
    void insertBeanAccount(Account account);

}
