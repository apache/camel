*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Splunk HEC component allows to send data to Splunk using the
https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/dataapps/httpeventcollector/[HTTP Event Collector].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------
 <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-splunk-hec</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
-------------------------------
  splunk-hec:[endpoint]/[token]?[options]
-------------------------------


// component options: START
The Splunk HEC component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Splunk HEC endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
splunk-hec:splunkURL/token
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *splunkURL* | *Required* Splunk Host URL |  | String
| *token* | *Required* Splunk authorization token |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (8 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* (producer) | Splunk host. |  | String
| *index* (producer) | Splunk index to write to | camel | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *source* (producer) | Splunk source argument | camel | String
| *sourceType* (producer) | Splunk sourcetype argument | camel | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *https* (security) | Contact HEC over https. | true | boolean
| *skipTlsVerify* (security) | Splunk HEC TLS verification. | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END

== Message body
The body must be serializable to JSON so it may be sent to Splunk.

A `String` or a `java.util.Map` object can be serialized easily.

== Use Cases
The Splunk HEC endpoint may be used to stream data to Splunk for ingestion.

It is meant for high volume ingestion of machine data.
