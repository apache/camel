== Ignite Compute Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.17*

The Ignite Compute endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to run https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/compute-grid[compute operations] on the cluster by passing in an IgniteCallable, an IgniteRunnable, an IgniteClosure, or collections of them, along with their parameters if necessary.

This endpoint only supports producers.

The host part of the endpoint URI is a symbolic endpoint ID, it is not used for any purposes.

The endpoint tries to run the object passed in the body of the IN message as the compute job. It expects different payload types depending on the execution type.

### Options

// component options: START
The Ignite Compute component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *ignite* (producer) | Sets the Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *configurationResource* (producer) | Sets the resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URI, String (URI) or an InputStream. |  | Object
| *igniteConfiguration* (producer) | Allows the user to set a programmatic IgniteConfiguration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *resolveProperty Placeholders* (advanced) | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Ignite Compute endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
ignite-compute:endpointId
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *endpointId* | *Required* The endpoint ID (not used). |  | String
|===


==== Query Parameters (8 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *clusterGroupExpression* (producer) | An expression that returns the Cluster Group for the IgniteCompute instance. |  | ClusterGroupExpression
| *computeName* (producer) | The name of the compute job, which will be set via IgniteCompute#withName(String). |  | String
| *executionType* (producer) | *Required* The compute operation to perform. Possible values: CALL, BROADCAST, APPLY, EXECUTE, RUN, AFFINITY_CALL, AFFINITY_RUN. The component expects different payload types depending on the operation. |  | IgniteComputeExecution Type
| *propagateIncomingBodyIfNo ReturnValue* (producer) | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | boolean
| *taskName* (producer) | The task name, only applicable if using the IgniteComputeExecutionType#EXECUTE execution type. |  | String
| *timeoutMillis* (producer) | The timeout interval for triggered jobs, in milliseconds, which will be set via IgniteCompute#withTimeout(long). |  | Long
| *treatCollectionsAsCache Objects* (producer) | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute, etc. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

The component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.ignite-compute.configuration-resource* | Sets the resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URI, String (URI) or an InputStream. The option is a java.lang.Object type. |  | String
