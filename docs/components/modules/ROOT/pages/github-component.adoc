*Since Camel 2.15*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The GitHub component interacts with the GitHub API by
encapsulating http://org.eclipse.egit.github.core[egit-github]. It
currently provides polling for new pull requests, pull request comments,
tags, and commits.  It is also able to produce comments on pull
requests, as well as close the pull request entirely.

Rather than webhooks, this endpoint relies on simple polling. Reasons
include:

* Concern for reliability/stability
* The types of payloads we're polling aren't typically large (plus,
paging is available in the API)
* The need to support apps running somewhere not publicly accessible
where a webhook would fail

Note that the GitHub API is fairly expansive.  Therefore, this component
could be easily expanded to provide additional interactions.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-github</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
-----------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,text]
---------------------------
github://endpoint[?options]
---------------------------

== Mandatory Options:

Note that these can be configured directly through the endpoint.


// component options: START
The GitHub component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The GitHub endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
github:type/branchName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *type* | *Required* What git operation to execute. The value can be one of: CLOSEPULLREQUEST, PULLREQUESTCOMMENT, COMMIT, PULLREQUEST, TAG, PULLREQUESTSTATE, PULLREQUESTFILES, GETCOMMITFILE, CREATEISSUE |  | GitHubType
| *branchName* | Name of branch |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (14 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *oauthToken* (common) | GitHub OAuth token, required unless username & password are provided |  | String
| *password* (common) | GitHub password, required unless oauthToken is provided |  | String
| *repoName* (common) | *Required* GitHub repository name |  | String
| *repoOwner* (common) | *Required* GitHub repository owner (organization) |  | String
| *username* (common) | GitHub username, required unless oauthToken is provided |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *encoding* (producer) | To use the given encoding when getting a git commit file |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *state* (producer) | To set git commit status state. The value can be one of: error, failure, pending, success |  | String
| *targetUrl* (producer) | To set git commit status target url |  | String
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
