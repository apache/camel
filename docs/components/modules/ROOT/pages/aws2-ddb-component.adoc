*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 DynamoDB component supports storing and retrieving data from/to
https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon's DynamoDB] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon DynamoDB. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon DynamoDB].

[NOTE]
====
The AWS2 DynamoDB component is not supported in OSGI
====

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws2-ddb://domainName[?options]
------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS 2 DynamoDB component supports 17 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonDDBClient* (producer) | *Autowired* To use the AmazonDynamoDB as the client |  | DynamoDbClient
| *configuration* (producer) | The component configuration |  | Ddb2Configuration
| *consistentRead* (producer) | Determines whether or not strong consistency should be enforced when data is read. | false | boolean
| *keyAttributeName* (producer) | Attribute name when creating table |  | String
| *keyAttributeType* (producer) | Attribute type when creating table |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | What operation to perform. There are 10 enums and the value can be one of: BatchGetItems, DeleteItem, DeleteTable, DescribeTable, GetItem, PutItem, Query, Scan, UpdateItem, UpdateTable | PutItem | Ddb2Operations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the DDB client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | The region in which DynamoDB client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the DDB client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *readCapacity* (producer) | The provisioned throughput to reserve for reading resources from your table |  | Long
| *region* (producer) | The region in which DDB client needs to work |  | String
| *trustAllCertificates* (producer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *writeCapacity* (producer) | The provisioned throughput to reserved for writing resources to your table |  | Long
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

=== Advanced AmazonDynamoDB configuration

If you need more control over the `AmazonDynamoDB` instance
configuration you can create your own instance and refer to it from the
URI:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("aws2-ddb://domainName?amazonDDBClient=#client");
----------------------------------------------------

The `#client` refers to a `DynamoDbClient` in the
Registry.

== Supported producer operations

- BatchGetItems
- DeleteItem
- DeleteTable
- DescribeTable
- GetItem
- PutItem
- Query
- Scan
- UpdateItem
- UpdateTable

== Automatic detection of DynamoDbClient client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an DynamoDbClient bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-ddb</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
