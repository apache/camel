*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The MSV component performs XML validation of the message body using the
https://msv.dev.java.net/[MSV Library] and any of the supported XML
schema languages, such as http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema[XML Schema] or
http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-msv</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the xref:jing-component.adoc[Jing] component also supports
http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html[RelaxNG Compact
Syntax]

== URI format

---------------------------------------
msv:someLocalOrRemoteResource[?options]
---------------------------------------

Where *someLocalOrRemoteResource* is some URL to a local resource on the
classpath or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file
system. For example

------------------------------
msv:org/foo/bar.rng
msv:file:../foo/bar.rng
msv:http://acme.com/cheese.rng
------------------------------


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or
directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END
// component options: START
== Component Options


The MSV component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *resourceResolverFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory
| *schemaFactory* (advanced) | To use the javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory. |  | SchemaFactory
|===
// component options: END
// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The MSV endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
msv:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* URL to a local resource on the classpath, or a reference to lookup a bean in the Registry, or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file system which contains the XSD to validate against. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (10 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *failOnNullBody* (producer) | Whether to fail if no body exists. | true | boolean
| *failOnNullHeader* (producer) | Whether to fail if no header exists when validating against a header. | true | boolean
| *headerName* (producer) | To validate against a header instead of the message body. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *errorHandler* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.processor.validation.ValidatorErrorHandler. The default error handler captures the errors and throws an exception. |  | ValidatorErrorHandler
| *resourceResolver* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver. Do not use together with resourceResolverFactory |  | LSResourceResolver
| *resourceResolverFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI. The default resource resolver factory resturns a resource resolver which can read files from the class path and file system. Do not use together with resourceResolver. |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory
| *schemaFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory |  | SchemaFactory
| *schemaLanguage* (advanced) | Configures the W3C XML Schema Namespace URI. | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema | String
| *useSharedSchema* (advanced) | Whether the Schema instance should be shared or not. This option is introduced to work around a JDK 1.6.x bug. Xerces should not have this issue. | true | boolean

== Example

The following
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/components/camel-msv/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/validator/msv/camelContext.xml[example]
shows how to configure a route from endpoint *direct:start* which then
goes to one of two endpoints, either *mock:valid* or *mock:invalid*
based on whether or not the XML matches the given
http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Schema] (which is supplied on the
classpath).
