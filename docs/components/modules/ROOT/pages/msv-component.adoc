= MSV Component

*Available as of Camel version 1.1*

The MSV component performs XML validation of the message body using the
https://msv.dev.java.net/[MSV Library] and any of the supported XML
schema languages, such as http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema[XML Schema] or
http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-msv</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the xref:jing-component.adoc[Jing] component also supports
http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html[RelaxNG Compact
Syntax]

== URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
msv:someLocalOrRemoteResource[?options]
---------------------------------------

Where *someLocalOrRemoteResource* is some URL to a local resource on the
classpath or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file
system. For example

[source,java]
------------------------------
msv:org/foo/bar.rng
msv:file:../foo/bar.rng
msv:http://acme.com/cheese.rng
------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Options




// component options: START
The MSV component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *schemaFactory* (advanced) | To use the javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory. |  | SchemaFactory
| *resourceResolverFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI |  | ValidatorResource ResolverFactory
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END






// endpoint options: START
The MSV endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
msv:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* URL to a local resource on the classpath,or a reference to lookup a bean in the Registry, or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file system which contains the XSD to validate against. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (12 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *failOnNullBody* (producer) | Whether to fail if no body exists. | true | boolean
| *failOnNullHeader* (producer) | Whether to fail if no header exists when validating against a header. | true | boolean
| *headerName* (producer) | To validate against a header instead of the message body. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *errorHandler* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.processor.validation.ValidatorErrorHandler. The default error handler captures the errors and throws an exception. |  | ValidatorErrorHandler
| *resourceResolver* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver. See also setResourceResolverFactory(ValidatorResourceResolverFactory) |  | LSResourceResolver
| *resourceResolverFactory* (advanced) | For creating a resource resolver which depends on the endpoint resource URI. Must not be used in combination with method setResourceResolver(LSResourceResolver). If not set then DefaultValidatorResourceResolverFactory is used |  | ValidatorResource ResolverFactory
| *schemaFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory |  | SchemaFactory
| *schemaLanguage* (advanced) | Configures the W3C XML Schema Namespace URI. | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *useSharedSchema* (advanced) | Whether the Schema instance should be shared or not. This option is introduced to work around a JDK 1.6.x bug. Xerces should not have this issue. | true | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: START
== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-msv-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.msv.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.msv.enabled* | Enable msv component | true | Boolean
| *camel.component.msv.resource-resolver-factory* | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI. The option is a org.apache.camel.component.validator.ValidatorResourceResolverFactory type. |  | String
| *camel.component.msv.schema-factory* | To use the javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory. The option is a javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory type. |  | String
|===
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: END




== Example

The following
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-msv/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/validator/msv/camelContext.xml[example]
shows how to configure a route from endpoint *direct:start* which then
goes to one of two endpoints, either *mock:valid* or *mock:invalid*
based on whether or not the XML matches the given
http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Schema] (which is supplied on the
classpath).
