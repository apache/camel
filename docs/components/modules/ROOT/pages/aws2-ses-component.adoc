*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 SES component supports sending emails with
https://aws.amazon.com/ses[Amazon's SES] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon SES. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/ses[Amazon SES].

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------
aws2-ses://from[?options]
------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Simple Email Service (SES) component supports 18 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonSESClient* (producer) | *Autowired* To use the AmazonSimpleEmailService as the client |  | SesClient
| *configuration* (producer) | component configuration |  | Ses2Configuration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *overrideEndpoint* (producer) | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | boolean
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the SES client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the SES client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the SES client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which SES client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *replyToAddresses* (producer) | List of reply-to email address(es) for the message, override it using 'CamelAwsSesReplyToAddresses' header. |  | List
| *returnPath* (producer) | The email address to which bounce notifications are to be forwarded, override it using 'CamelAwsSesReturnPath' header. |  | String
| *subject* (producer) | The subject which is used if the message header 'CamelAwsSesSubject' is not present. |  | String
| *to* (producer) | List of destination email address. Can be overriden with 'CamelAwsSesTo' header. |  | List
| *trustAllCertificates* (producer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *uriEndpointOverride* (producer) | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option |  | String
| *useDefaultCredentialsProvider* (producer) | Set whether the Ses client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

// endpoint options: START
The AWS Simple Email Service (SES) endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

Required SES component options

You have to provide the amazonSESClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/ses[Amazon's SES].

== Usage

=== Static credentials vs Default Credential Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static credentials, by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and set it to true.

 - Java system properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey
 - Environment variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
 - Web Identity Token from AWS STS.
 - The shared credentials and config files.
 - Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the environment variable AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI is set.
 - Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials. 

For more information about this you can look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS credentials documentation]

=== Message headers evaluated by the SES producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSesFrom` |`String` |The sender's email address.

|`CamelAwsSesTo` |`List<String>` |The destination(s) for this email.

|`CamelAwsSesSubject` |`String` |The subject of the message.

|`CamelAwsSesReplyToAddresses` |`List<String>` |The reply-to email address(es) for the message.

|`CamelAwsSesReturnPath` |`String` |The email address to which bounce notifications are to be forwarded.

|`CamelAwsSesHtmlEmail` |`Boolean` |The flag to show if email content is HTML.
|=======================================================================

=== Message headers set by the SES producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsSesMessageId` |`String` |The Amazon SES message ID.
|=======================================================================

=== Advanced SesClient configuration

If you need more control over the `SesClient` instance
configuration you can create your own instance and refer to it from the
URI:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
.to("aws2-ses://example@example.com?amazonSESClient=#client");
-------------------------------------------------------------

The `#client` refers to a `SesClient` in the
Registry.

== Producer Examples

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:start")
    .setHeader(SesConstants.SUBJECT, constant("This is my subject"))
    .setHeader(SesConstants.TO, constant(Collections.singletonList("to@example.com"))
    .setBody(constant("This is my message text."))
    .to("aws2-ses://from@example.com?accessKey=xxx&secretKey=yyy");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-ses</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
