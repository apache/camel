*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The IRC component implements an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat[IRC] (Internet Relay
Chat) transport.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-irc</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END
// component options: START
== Component Options


The IRC component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean
|===
// component options: END
// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The IRC endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
irc:hostname:port
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *hostname* | *Required* Hostname for the IRC chat server |  | String
| *port* | Port number for the IRC chat server. If no port is configured then a default port of either 6667, 6668 or 6669 is used. |  | int
|===


=== Query Parameters (27 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoRejoin* (common) | Whether to auto re-join when being kicked | true | boolean
| *channels* (common) | Comma separated list of IRC channels. |  | String
| *commandTimeout* (common) | Delay in milliseconds before sending commands after the connection is established. | 5000 | long
| *keys* (common) | Comma separated list of keys for channels. |  | String
| *namesOnJoin* (common) | Sends NAMES command to channel after joining it. onReply has to be true in order to process the result which will have the header value irc.num = '353'. | false | boolean
| *nickname* (common) | The nickname used in chat. |  | String
| *persistent* (common) | *Deprecated* Use persistent messages. | true | boolean
| *realname* (common) | The IRC user's actual name. |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *colors* (advanced) | Whether or not the server supports color codes. | true | boolean
| *onJoin* (filter) | Handle user join events. | true | boolean
| *onKick* (filter) | Handle kick events. | true | boolean
| *onMode* (filter) | Handle mode change events. | true | boolean
| *onNick* (filter) | Handle nickname change events. | true | boolean
| *onPart* (filter) | Handle user part events. | true | boolean
| *onPrivmsg* (filter) | Handle private message events. | true | boolean
| *onQuit* (filter) | Handle user quit events. | true | boolean
| *onReply* (filter) | Whether or not to handle general responses to commands or informational messages. | false | boolean
| *onTopic* (filter) | Handle topic change events. | true | boolean
| *nickPassword* (security) | Your IRC server nickname password. |  | String
| *password* (security) | The IRC server password. |  | String
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | Used for configuring security using SSL. Reference to a org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters in the Registry. This reference overrides any configured SSLContextParameters at the component level. Note that this setting overrides the trustManager option. |  | SSLContextParameters
| *trustManager* (security) | The trust manager used to verify the SSL server's certificate. |  | SSLTrustManager
| *username* (security) | The IRC server user name. |  | String
|===
// endpoint options: END

== SSL Support

=== Using the JSSE Configuration Utility

The IRC component supports SSL/TLS configuration
through the xref:manual::camel-configuration-utilities.adoc[Camel JSSE
Configuration Utility].  This utility greatly decreases the amount of
component specific code you need to write and is configurable at the
endpoint and component levels.  The following examples demonstrate how
to use the utility with the IRC component.

[[IRC-Programmaticconfigurationoftheendpoint]]
Programmatic configuration of the endpoint

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyStoreParameters ksp = new KeyStoreParameters();
ksp.setResource("/users/home/server/truststore.jks");
ksp.setPassword("keystorePassword");

TrustManagersParameters tmp = new TrustManagersParameters();
tmp.setKeyStore(ksp);

SSLContextParameters scp = new SSLContextParameters();
scp.setTrustManagers(tmp);

Registry registry = ...
registry.bind("sslContextParameters", scp);

...

from(...)
    .to("ircs://camel-prd-user@server:6669/#camel-test?nickname=camel-prd&password=password&sslContextParameters=#sslContextParameters");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[IRC-SpringDSLbasedconfigurationofendpoint]]
Spring DSL based configuration of endpoint

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
  <camel:sslContextParameters
      id="sslContextParameters">
    <camel:trustManagers>
      <camel:keyStore
          resource="/users/home/server/truststore.jks"
          password="keystorePassword"/>
    </camel:keyManagers>
  </camel:sslContextParameters>...
...
  <to uri="ircs://camel-prd-user@server:6669/#camel-test?nickname=camel-prd&password=password&sslContextParameters=#sslContextParameters"/>...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Using the legacy basic configuration options

You can also connect to an SSL enabled IRC server, as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
ircs:host[:port]/#room?username=user&password=pass
--------------------------------------------------

By default, the IRC transport uses
http://moepii.sourceforge.net/irclib/javadoc/org/schwering/irc/lib/ssl/SSLDefaultTrustManager.html[SSLDefaultTrustManager].
If you need to provide your own custom trust manager, use the
`trustManager` parameter as follows:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ircs:host[:port]/#room?username=user&password=pass&trustManager=#referenceToMyTrustManagerBean
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Using keys

Some irc rooms requires you to provide a key to be able to join that
channel. The key is just a secret word.

For example we join 3 channels where as only channel 1 and 3 uses a key.

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
irc:nick@irc.server.org?channels=#chan1,#chan2,#chan3&keys=chan1Key,,chan3key
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Getting a list of users of the channel

Using the `namesOnJoin` option one can invoke the IRC-`NAMES` command after the component has joined a channel. 
The server will reply with `irc.num = 353`. So in order to process the result the property `onReply` has to be `true`.
Furthermore one has to filter the `onReply` exchanges in order to get the names.

For example we want to get all exchanges that contain the usernames of the channel:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("ircs:nick@myserver:1234/#mychannelname?namesOnJoin=true&onReply=true")
	.choice()
		.when(header("irc.messageType").isEqualToIgnoreCase("REPLY"))
			.filter(header("irc.num").isEqualTo("353"))
			.to("mock:result").stop();
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Sending to different channel or a person

If you need to send messages to a different channel (or a person) which is not defined on IRC endpoint, you can specify a different destination in a message header.

You can specify the destination in the following header:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=====================================================================
|Header |Type |Description
|`irc.sendTo` |`String` |The channel (or the person) name.
|=====================================================================
