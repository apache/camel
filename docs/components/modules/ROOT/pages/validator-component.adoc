= Validator Component
:page-source: components/camel-validator/src/main/docs/validator-component.adoc

*Since Camel 1.1*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Validation component performs XML validation of the message body
using the JAXP Validation API and based on any of the supported XML
schema languages, which defaults to http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema[XML
Schema]

Note that the xref:jing-component.adoc[Jing] component also supports the following
useful schema languages:

* http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html[RelaxNG Compact
Syntax]
* http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax]

The xref:msv-component.adoc[MSV] component also supports
http://relaxng.org/[RelaxNG XML Syntax].

== URI format

[source]
----
validator:someLocalOrRemoteResource
----

Where *someLocalOrRemoteResource* is some URL to a local resource on the
classpath or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file
system which contains the XSD to validate against. For example:

* `msv:org/foo/bar.xsd`
* `msv:file:../foo/bar.xsd`
* `msv:http://acme.com/cheese.xsd`
* `validator:com/mypackage/myschema.xsd`

The Validation component is provided directly in the camel-core.

== Options

// component options: START
The Validator component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *resourceResolverFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory
|===
// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Validator endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
validator:resourceUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceUri* | *Required* URL to a local resource on the classpath, or a reference to lookup a bean in the Registry, or a full URL to a remote resource or resource on the file system which contains the XSD to validate against. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (12 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *failOnNullBody* (producer) | Whether to fail if no body exists. | true | boolean
| *failOnNullHeader* (producer) | Whether to fail if no header exists when validating against a header. | true | boolean
| *headerName* (producer) | To validate against a header instead of the message body. |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *errorHandler* (advanced) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.processor.validation.ValidatorErrorHandler. The default error handler captures the errors and throws an exception. |  | ValidatorErrorHandler
| *resourceResolver* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver. Do not use together with resourceResolverFactory |  | LSResourceResolver
| *resourceResolverFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom LSResourceResolver which depends on a dynamic endpoint resource URI. The default resource resolver factory resturns a resource resolver which can read files from the class path and file system. Do not use together with resourceResolver. |  | ValidatorResourceResolverFactory
| *schemaFactory* (advanced) | To use a custom javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory |  | SchemaFactory
| *schemaLanguage* (advanced) | Configures the W3C XML Schema Namespace URI. | http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *useSharedSchema* (advanced) | Whether the Schema instance should be shared or not. This option is introduced to work around a JDK 1.6.x bug. Xerces should not have this issue. | true | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Example

The following
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/validator/camelContext.xml[example]
shows how to configure a route from endpoint *direct:start* which then
goes to one of two endpoints, either *mock:valid* or *mock:invalid*
based on whether or not the XML matches the given schema (which is
supplied on the classpath).

== Advanced: JMX method clearCachedSchema

You can force that the cached schema in the
validator endpoint is cleared and reread with the next process call with
the JMX operation `clearCachedSchema`. You can also use this method to
programmatically clear the cache. This method is available on the
`ValidatorEndpoint` class.
