== XChange Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.21*

The *xchange:* component uses the https://knowm.org/open-source/xchange/[XChange] Java library to provide access to 60+ Bitcoin and Altcoin exchanges.
It comes with a consistent interface for trading and accessing market data. 

Camel can get crypto currency market data, query historical data, place market orders and much more.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-xchange</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-xchange-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.xchange.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the xchange component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.xchange.resolve-property-placeholders* | Whether the component should resolve property placeholders on itself when starting. Only properties which are of String type can use property placeholders. | true | Boolean
|===
// spring-boot-auto-configure options: END


### Authentication

This component communicates with supported crypto currency exchanges via REST API. Some API requests use simple unauthenticated GET request. 
For most of the interesting stuff however, you'd need an account with the exchange and have API access keys enabled.

These API access keys need to be guarded tightly, especially so when they also allow for the withdraw functionality. 
In which case, anyone who can get hold of your API keys can easily transfer funds from your account to some other address i.e. steal your money.   

Your API access keys can be strored in an exchange specific properties file in your SSH directory.
For Binance for example this would be: `~/.ssh/binance-secret.keys`
