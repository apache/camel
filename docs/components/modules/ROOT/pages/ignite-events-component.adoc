*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Ignite Events endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/events[receive events] from the Ignite cluster by creating a local event listener.

This endpoint only supports consumers.
The Exchanges created by this consumer put the received Event object into the body of the IN message.

== Options

// component options: START
The Ignite Events component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *configurationResource* (consumer) | The resource from where to load the configuration. It can be a: URL, String or InputStream type. |  | Object
| *ignite* (consumer) | To use an existing Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *igniteConfiguration* (consumer) | Allows the user to set a programmatic ignite configuration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
