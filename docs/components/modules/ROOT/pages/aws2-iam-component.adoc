*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 IAM component supports create, run, start, stop and terminate
https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[AWS IAM] instances.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon IAM. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[Amazon IAM].

[NOTE]
====
The AWS2 IAM component is not supported in OSGI
====

== URI Format

[source,java]
-------------------------
aws2-iam://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) component supports 16 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (producer) | Component configuration |  | IAM2Configuration
| *iamClient* (producer) | *Autowired* To use a existing configured AWS IAM as client |  | IamClient
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to perform. You can configure a default operation on the component level, or the operation as part of the endpoint, or via a message header with the key CamelAwsIAMOperation. There are 13 enums and the value can be one of: listAccessKeys, createUser, deleteUser, getUser, listUsers, createAccessKey, deleteAccessKey, updateAccessKey, createGroup, deleteGroup, listGroups, addUserToGroup, removeUserFromGroup |  | IAM2Operations
| *overrideEndpoint* (producer) | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | boolean
| *pojoRequest* (producer) | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not | false | boolean
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the IAM client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the IAM client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the IAM client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which IAM client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | aws-global | String
| *trustAllCertificates* (producer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *uriEndpointOverride* (producer) | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option |  | String
| *useDefaultCredentialsProvider* (producer) | Set whether the IAM client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

Required IAM component options

You have to provide the amazonKmsClient in the
Registry or your accessKey and secretKey to access
the https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[Amazon IAM] service.

== Usage

=== Message headers evaluated by the IAM producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsIAMOperation` |`String` |The operation we want to perform

|`CamelAwsIAMUsername` |`String` |The username for the user you want to manage

|`CamelAwsIAMAccessKeyID` |`String` |The accessKey you want to manage

|`CamelAwsIAMAccessKeyStatus` |`String` |The Status of the AccessKey you want to set, possible value are active and inactive

|`CamelAwsIAMGroupName` |`String` |The name of an AWS IAM Group

|`CamelAwsIAMGroupPath` |`String` |The path of an AWS IAM Group
|=======================================================================

[NOTE]
====
The AWS2 IAM component works on the aws-global region and it has aws-global as default region
====


=== Static credentials vs Default Credential Provider

You have the possibility of avoiding the usage of explicit static credentials, by specifying the useDefaultCredentialsProvider option and set it to true.

 - Java system properties - aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey
 - Environment variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
 - Web Identity Token from AWS STS.
 - The shared credentials and config files.
 - Amazon ECS container credentials - loaded from the Amazon ECS if the environment variable AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI is set.
 - Amazon EC2 Instance profile credentials. 

For more information about this you can look at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS credentials documentation]

=== IAM Producer operations

Camel-AWS2 IAM component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- listAccessKeys
- createUser
- deleteUser
- listUsers
- getUser
- createAccessKey
- deleteAccessKey
- updateAccessKey
- createGroup
- deleteGroup
- listGroups
- addUserToGroup
- removeUserFromGroup

== Producer Examples

- createUser: this operation will create a user in IAM

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:createUser")
    .setHeader(IAM2Constants.USERNAME, constant("camel"))
    .to("aws2-iam://test?iamClient=#amazonIAMClient&operation=createUser")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- deleteUser: this operation will delete a user in IAM

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:deleteUser")
    .setHeader(IAM2Constants.USERNAME, constant("camel"))
    .to("aws2-iam://test?iamClient=#amazonIAMClient&operation=deleteUser")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- listUsers: this operation will list the users in IAM

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listUsers")
    .to("aws2-iam://test?iamClient=#amazonIAMClient&operation=listUsers")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- createGroup: this operation will add a group in IAM

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:deleteUser")
    .setHeader(IAM2Constants.GROUP_NAME, constant("camel"))
    .to("aws2-iam://test?iamClient=#amazonIAMClient&operation=createGroup")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- deleteGroup: this operation will delete a group in IAM

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:deleteUser")
    .setHeader(IAM2Constants.GROUP_NAME, constant("camel"))
    .to("aws2-iam://test?iamClient=#amazonIAMClient&operation=deleteGroup")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- listGroups: this operation will list the groups in IAM

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listUsers")
    .to("aws2-iam://test?iamClient=#amazonIAMClient&operation=listGroups")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Using a POJO as body

Sometimes build an AWS Request can be complex, because of multiple options. We introduce the possibility to use a POJO as body.
In AWS IAM there are multiple operations you can submit, as an example for Create User request, you can do something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:createUser")
     .setBody(CreateUserRequest.builder().userName("camel").build())
    .to("aws2-iam://test?iamClient=#amazonIAMClient&operation=createUser&pojoRequest=true")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll pass the request directly without the need of passing headers and options specifically related to this operation.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-iam</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
