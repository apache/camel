*Since Camel 2.10*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

This component provides an idemptotent repository, producers and
consumers for http://hbase.apache.org/[Apache HBase].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-hbase</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== Apache HBase Overview

HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store
modeled after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for
Structured Data. You can use HBase when you need random, realtime
read/write access to your Big Data. More information at
http://hbase.apache.org[Apache HBase].

== Camel and HBase

When using a datasotre inside a camel route, there is always the
chalenge of specifying how the camel message will stored to the
datastore. In document based stores things are more easy as the message
body can be directly mapped to a document. In relational databases an
ORM solution can be used to map properties to columns etc. In column
based stores things are more challenging as there is no standard way to
perform that kind of mapping.

HBase adds two additional challenges:

* HBase groups columns into families, so just mapping a property to a
column using a name convention is just not enough.
* HBase doesn't have the notion of type, which means that it stores
everything as byte[] and doesn't know if the byte[] represents a String,
a Number, a serialized Java object or just binary data.

To overcome these challenges, camel-hbase makes use of the message
headers to specify the mapping of the message to HBase columns. It also
provides the ability to use some camel-hbase provided classes that model
HBase data and can be easily convert to and from xml/json etc. +
 Finally it provides the ability to the user to implement and use his
own mapping strategy.

Regardless of the mapping strategy camel-hbase will convert a message
into an org.apache.camel.component.hbase.model.HBaseData object and use
that object for its internal operations.

== Configuring the component

The HBase component can be provided a custom HBaseConfiguration object
as a property or it can create an HBase configuration object on its own
based on the HBase related resources that are found on classpath.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bean id="hbase" class="org.apache.camel.component.hbase.HBaseComponent">
        <property name="configuration" ref="config"/>
    </bean>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If no configuration object is provided to the component, the component
will create one. The created configuration will search the class path
for an hbase-site.xml file, from which it will draw the configuration.
You can find more information about how to configure HBase clients at:
http://archive.apache.org/dist/hbase/docs/client_dependencies.html[HBase
client configuration and dependencies]

== HBase Producer

As mentioned above camel provides produers endpoints for HBase. This
allows you to store, delete, retrieve or query data from HBase using
your camel routes.

[source,java]
-----------------------
hbase://table[?options]
-----------------------

where *table* is the table name.

The supported operations are:

* Put
* Get
* Delete
* Scan

=== Supported URI options




// component options: START
The HBase component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *poolMaxSize* (common) | Maximum number of references to keep for each table in the HTable pool. The default value is 10. | 10 | int
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | To use the shared configuration |  | Configuration

=== Put Operations.

HBase is a column based store, which allows you to store data into a
specific column of a specific row. Columns are grouped into families, so
in order to specify a column you need to specify the column family and
the qualifier of that column. To store data into a specific column you
need to specify both the column and the row.

The simplest scenario for storing data into HBase from a camel route,
would be to store part of the message body to specified HBase column.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:in"/>
            <!-- Set the HBase Row -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseRowId">
                <el>${in.body.id}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <!-- Set the HBase Value -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseValue">
                <el>${in.body.value}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <to uri="hbase:mytable?operation=CamelHBasePut&amp;family=myfamily&amp;qualifier=myqualifier"/>
        </route>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The route above assumes that the message body contains an object that
has an id and value property and will store the content of value in the
HBase column myfamily:myqualifier in the row specified by id. If we
needed to specify more than one column/value pairs we could just specify
additional column mappings. Notice that you must use numbers from the
2nd header onwards, eg RowId2, RowId3, RowId4, etc. Only the 1st header
does not have the number 1.

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:in"/>
            <!-- Set the HBase Row 1st column -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseRowId">
                <el>${in.body.id}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <!-- Set the HBase Row 2nd column -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseRowId2">
                <el>${in.body.id}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <!-- Set the HBase Value for 1st column -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseValue">
                <el>${in.body.value}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <!-- Set the HBase Value for 2nd column -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseValue2">
                <el>${in.body.othervalue}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <to uri="hbase:mytable?operation=CamelHBasePut&amp;family=myfamily&amp;qualifier=myqualifier&amp;family2=myfamily&amp;qualifier2=myqualifier2"/>
        </route>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to remember that you can use uri options, message
headers or a combination of both. It is recommended to specify constants
as part of the uri and dynamic values as headers. If something is
defined both as header and as part of the uri, the header will be used.

=== Get Operations.

A Get Operation is an operation that is used to retrieve one or more
values from a specified HBase row. To specify what are the values that
you want to retrieve you can just specify them as part of the uri or as
message headers.

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:in"/>
            <!-- Set the HBase Row of the Get -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseRowId">
                <el>${in.body.id}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <to uri="hbase:mytable?operation=CamelHBaseGet&amp;family=myfamily&amp;qualifier=myqualifier&amp;valueType=java.lang.Long"/>
            <to uri="log:out"/>
        </route>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the example above the result of the get operation will be stored as a
header with name CamelHBaseValue.

=== Delete Operations.

You can also you camel-hbase to perform HBase delete operation. The
delete operation will remove an entire row. All that needs to be
specified is one or more rows as part of the message headers.

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:in"/>
            <!-- Set the HBase Row of the Get -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseRowId">
                <el>${in.body.id}</el>
            </setHeader>
            <to uri="hbase:mytable?operation=CamelHBaseDelete"/>
        </route>
----------------------------------------------------------------

=== Scan Operations.

A scan operation is the equivalent of a query in HBase. You can use the
scan operation to retrieve multiple rows. To specify what columns should
be part of the result and also specify how the values will be converted
to objects you can use either uri options or headers.

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:in"/>
            <to uri="hbase:mytable?operation=CamelHBaseScan&amp;family=myfamily&amp;qualifier=myqualifier&amp;valueType=java.lang.Long&amp;rowType=java.lang.String"/>
            <to uri="log:out"/>
        </route>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case its probable that you also also need to specify a list of
filters for limiting the results. You can specify a list of filters as
part of the uri and camel will return only the rows that satisfy *ALL*
the filters.  +
 To have a filter that will be aware of the information that is part of
the message, camel defines the ModelAwareFilter. This will allow your
filter to take into consideration the model that is defined by the
message and the mapping strategy. +
 When using a ModelAwareFilter camel-hbase will apply the selected
mapping strategy to the in message, will create an object that models
the mapping and will pass that object to the Filter.

For example to perform scan using as criteria the message headers, you
can make use of the ModelAwareColumnMatchingFilter as shown below.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:scan"/>
            <!-- Set the Criteria -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseFamily">
                <constant>name</constant>
            </setHeader>
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseQualifier">
                <constant>first</constant>
            </setHeader>
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseValue">
                <el>in.body.firstName</el>
            </setHeader>
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseFamily2">
                <constant>name</constant>
            </setHeader>
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseQualifier2">
                <constant>last</constant>
            </setHeader>
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseValue2">
                <el>in.body.lastName</el>
            </setHeader>
            <!-- Set additional fields that you want to be return by skipping value -->
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseFamily3">
                <constant>address</constant>
            </setHeader>
            <setHeader name="CamelHBaseQualifier3">
                <constant>country</constant>
            </setHeader>
            <to uri="hbase:mytable?operation=CamelHBaseScan&amp;filters=#myFilterList"/>
        </route>

        <bean id="myFilters" class="java.util.ArrayList">
            <constructor-arg>
                <list>
                    <bean class="org.apache.camel.component.hbase.filters.ModelAwareColumnMatchingFilter"/>
                </list>
            </constructor-arg>
        </bean>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The route above assumes that a pojo is with properties firstName and
lastName is passed as the message body, it takes those properties and
adds them as part of the message headers. The default mapping strategy
will create a model object that will map the headers to HBase columns
and will pass that model the ModelAwareColumnMatchingFilter. The
filter will filter out any rows, that do not contain columns that match
the model. It is like query by example.

== HBase Consumer

The Camel HBase Consumer, will perform repeated scan on the specified
HBase table and will return the scan results as part of the message. You
can either specify header mapping (default) or body mapping. The later
will just add the org.apache.camel.component.hbase.model.HBaseData as
part of the message body.

[source,java]
-----------------------
hbase://table[?options]
-----------------------

You can specify the columns that you want to be return and their types
as part of the uri options:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hbase:mutable?family=name&qualifer=first&valueType=java.lang.String&family=address&qualifer=number&valueType2=java.lang.Integer&rowType=java.lang.Long
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The example above will create a model object that is consisted of the
specified fields and the scan results will populate the model object
with values. Finally the mapping strategy will be used to map this model
to the camel message.

== HBase Idempotent repository

The camel-hbase component also provides an idempotent repository which
can be used when you want to make sure that each message is processed
only once. The HBase idempotent repository is configured with a table, a
column family and a column qualifier and will create to that table a row
per message.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HBaseConfiguration configuration = HBaseConfiguration.create();
HBaseIdempotentRepository repository = new HBaseIdempotentRepository(configuration, tableName, family, qualifier);

from("direct:in")
  .idempotentConsumer(header("messageId"), repository)
  .to("log:out);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== HBase Mapping

It was mentioned above that you the default mapping strategies are
*header* and *body* mapping. +
 Below you can find some detailed examples of how each mapping strategy
works.

=== HBase Header mapping Examples

The header mapping is the default mapping. 
 To put the value "myvalue" into HBase row "myrow" and column
"myfamily:mycolum" the message should contain the following headers:

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Value

|CamelHBaseRowId |myrow

|CamelHBaseFamily |myfamily

|CamelHBaseQualifier |myqualifier

|CamelHBaseValue |myvalue
|=======================================================================

To put more values for different columns and / or different rows you can
specify additional headers suffixed with the index of the headers, e.g:

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Value

|CamelHBaseRowId |myrow

|CamelHBaseFamily |myfamily

|CamelHBaseQualifier |myqualifier

|CamelHBaseValue |myvalue

|CamelHBaseRowId2 |myrow2

|CamelHBaseFamily2 |myfamily

|CamelHBaseQualifier2 |myqualifier

|CamelHBaseValue2 |myvalue2
|=======================================================================

In the case of retrieval operations such as get or scan you can also
specify for each column the type that you want the data to be converted
to. For exampe:

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Value

|CamelHBaseFamily |myfamily

|CamelHBaseQualifier |myqualifier

|CamelHBaseValueType |Long
|=======================================================================

Please note that in order to avoid boilerplate headers that are
considered constant for all messages, you can also specify them as part
of the endpoint uri, as you will see below.

=== Body mapping Examples

In order to use the body mapping strategy you will have to specify the
option mappingStrategy as part of the uri, for example:

[source,java]
----------------------------------
hbase:mytable?mappingStrategyName=body
----------------------------------

To use the body mapping strategy the body needs to contain an instance
of org.apache.camel.component.hbase.model.HBaseData. You can construct t

[source,java]
---------------------------------
HBaseData data = new HBaseData();
HBaseRow row = new HBaseRow();
row.setId("myRowId");
HBaseCell cell = new HBaseCell();
cell.setFamily("myfamily");
cell.setQualifier("myqualifier");
cell.setValue("myValue");
row.getCells().add(cell);
data.addRows().add(row);
---------------------------------

The object above can be used for example in a put operation and will
result in creating or updating the row with id myRowId and add the value
myvalue to the column myfamily:myqualifier. +
 The body mapping strategy might not seem very appealing at first. The
advantage it has over the header mapping strategy is that the HBaseData
object can be easily converted to or from xml/json.
