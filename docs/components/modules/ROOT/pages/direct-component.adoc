:docTitle: Direct
:artifactId: camel-direct
:description: Call another endpoint from the same Camel Context synchronously.
:since: 1.0
:supportLevel: Stable
:component-header: Both producer and consumer are supported
:core:

*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Direct component provides direct, synchronous invocation of any
consumers when a producer sends a message exchange. +
 This endpoint can be used to connect existing routes in the *same*
camel context.

[TIP]
====
*Asynchronous*

The xref:seda-component.adoc[SEDA] component provides asynchronous invocation of
any consumers when a producer sends a message exchange.
====

[TIP]
====
*Connection to other camel contexts*

The xref:vm-component.adoc[VM] component provides connections between Camel
contexts as long they run in the same *JVM*.

Where *someName* can be any string to uniquely identify the endpoint

== Options



// component options: START
The Direct component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *block* (producer) | If sending a message to a direct endpoint which has no active consumer, then we can tell the producer to block and wait for the consumer to become active. | true | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *timeout* (producer) | The timeout value to use if block is enabled. | 30000 | long
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END




// endpoint options: START
The Direct endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
direct:name
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *name* | *Required* Name of direct endpoint |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (8 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *block* (producer) | If sending a message to a direct endpoint which has no active consumer, then we can tell the producer to block and wait for the consumer to become active. | true | boolean
| *failIfNoConsumers* (producer) | Whether the producer should fail by throwing an exception, when sending to a DIRECT endpoint with no active consumers. | true | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *timeout* (producer) | The timeout value to use if block is enabled. | 30000 | long
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Samples

In the route below we use the direct component to link the two routes
together:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:queue:order.in")
    .to("bean:orderServer?method=validate")
    .to("direct:processOrder");

from("direct:processOrder")
    .to("bean:orderService?method=process")
    .to("activemq:queue:order.out");
----

And the sample using spring DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
 <from uri="activemq:queue:order.in"/>
 <to uri="bean:orderService?method=validate"/>
 <to uri="direct:processOrder"/>
</route>

<route>
 <from uri="direct:processOrder"/>
 <to uri="bean:orderService?method=process"/>
 <to uri="activemq:queue:order.out"/>
</route>
----

See also samples from the xref:seda-component.adoc[SEDA] component, how they can
be used together.
