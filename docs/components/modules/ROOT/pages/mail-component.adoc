*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Mail component provides access to Email via Spring's Mail support
and the underlying JavaMail system.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-mail</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

[WARNING]
====
*Geronimo mail .jar*

We have discovered that the geronimo mail `.jar` (v1.6) has a bug when
polling mails with attachments. It cannot correctly identify the
`Content-Type`. So, if you attach a `.jpeg` file to a mail and you poll
it, the `Content-Type` is resolved as `text/plain` and not as
`image/jpeg`. For that reason, we have added an
`org.apache.camel.component.ContentTypeResolver` SPI interface which
enables you to provide your own implementation and fix this bug by
returning the correct Mime type based on the file name. So if the file
name ends with `jpeg/jpg`, you can return `image/jpeg`.
====

You can set your custom resolver on the `MailComponent` instance or on
the `MailEndpoint` instance.


[TIP]
====
*POP3 or IMAP*

POP3 has some limitations and end users are encouraged to use IMAP if
possible.
====

[NOTE]
====
*Using mock-mail for testing*

You can use a mock framework for unit testing, which allows you to test
without the need for a real mail server. However you should remember to
not include the mock-mail when you go into production or other
environments where you need to send mails to a real mail server. Just
the presence of the mock-javamail.jar on the classpath means that it
will kick in and avoid sending the mails.
====

== URI format

Mail endpoints can have one of the following URI formats (for the
protocols, SMTP, POP3, or IMAP, respectively):

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
smtp://[username@]host[:port][?options]
pop3://[username@]host[:port][?options]
imap://[username@]host[:port][?options]
---------------------------------------

The mail component also supports secure variants of these protocols
(layered over SSL). You can enable the secure protocols by adding `s` to
the scheme:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------
smtps://[username@]host[:port][?options]
pop3s://[username@]host[:port][?options]
imaps://[username@]host[:port][?options]
----------------------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`


== Component options


// component options: START
The Mail component supports 42 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *closeFolder* (consumer) | Whether the consumer should close the folder after polling. Setting this option to false and having disconnect=false as well, then the consumer keep the folder open between polls. | true | boolean
| *copyTo* (consumer) | After processing a mail message, it can be copied to a mail folder with the given name. You can override this configuration value, with a header with the key copyTo, allowing you to copy messages to folder names configured at runtime. |  | String
| *delete* (consumer) | Deletes the messages after they have been processed. This is done by setting the DELETED flag on the mail message. If false, the SEEN flag is set instead. As of Camel 2.10 you can override this configuration option by setting a header with the key delete to determine if the mail should be deleted or not. | false | boolean
| *disconnect* (consumer) | Whether the consumer should disconnect after polling. If enabled this forces Camel to connect on each poll. | false | boolean
| *handleFailedMessage* (consumer) | If the mail consumer cannot retrieve a given mail message, then this option allows to handle the caused exception by the consumer's error handler. By enable the bridge error handler on the consumer, then the Camel routing error handler can handle the exception instead. The default behavior would be the consumer throws an exception and no mails from the batch would be able to be routed by Camel. | false | boolean
| *mimeDecodeHeaders* (consumer) | This option enables transparent MIME decoding and unfolding for mail headers. | false | boolean
| *moveTo* (consumer) | After processing a mail message, it can be moved to a mail folder with the given name. You can override this configuration value, with a header with the key moveTo, allowing you to move messages to folder names configured at runtime. |  | String
| *peek* (consumer) | Will mark the javax.mail.Message as peeked before processing the mail message. This applies to IMAPMessage messages types only. By using peek the mail will not be eager marked as SEEN on the mail server, which allows us to rollback the mail message if there is an error processing in Camel. | true | boolean
| *skipFailedMessage* (consumer) | If the mail consumer cannot retrieve a given mail message, then this option allows to skip the message and move on to retrieve the next mail message. The default behavior would be the consumer throws an exception and no mails from the batch would be able to be routed by Camel. | false | boolean
| *unseen* (consumer) | Whether to limit by unseen mails only. | true | boolean
| *fetchSize* (consumer) | Sets the maximum number of messages to consume during a poll. This can be used to avoid overloading a mail server, if a mailbox folder contains a lot of messages. Default value of -1 means no fetch size and all messages will be consumed. Setting the value to 0 is a special corner case, where Camel will not consume any messages at all. | -1 | int
| *folderName* (consumer) | The folder to poll. | INBOX | String
| *mapMailMessage* (consumer) | Specifies whether Camel should map the received mail message to Camel body/headers/attachments. If set to true, the body of the mail message is mapped to the body of the Camel IN message, the mail headers are mapped to IN headers, and the attachments to Camel IN attachment message. If this option is set to false then the IN message contains a raw javax.mail.Message. You can retrieve this raw message by calling exchange.getIn().getBody(javax.mail.Message.class). | true | boolean
| *bcc* (producer) | Sets the BCC email address. Separate multiple email addresses with comma. |  | String
| *cc* (producer) | Sets the CC email address. Separate multiple email addresses with comma. |  | String
| *from* (producer) | The from email address | camel@localhost | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *replyTo* (producer) | The Reply-To recipients (the receivers of the response mail). Separate multiple email addresses with a comma. |  | String
| *subject* (producer) | The Subject of the message being sent. Note: Setting the subject in the header takes precedence over this option. |  | String
| *to* (producer) | Sets the To email address. Separate multiple email addresses with comma. |  | String
| *javaMailSender* (producer) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.component.mail.JavaMailSender for sending emails. |  | JavaMailSender
| *additionalJavaMailProperties* (advanced) | Sets additional java mail properties, that will append/override any default properties that is set based on all the other options. This is useful if you need to add some special options but want to keep the others as is. |  | Properties
| *alternativeBodyHeader* (advanced) | Specifies the key to an IN message header that contains an alternative email body. For example, if you send emails in text/html format and want to provide an alternative mail body for non-HTML email clients, set the alternative mail body with this key as a header. | CamelMailAlternativeBody | String
| *attachmentsContentTransfer{zwsp}EncodingResolver* (advanced) | To use a custom AttachmentsContentTransferEncodingResolver to resolve what content-type-encoding to use for attachments. |  | AttachmentsContentTransferEncodingResolver
| *authenticator* (advanced) | The authenticator for login. If set then the password and username are ignored. Can be used for tokens which can expire and therefore must be read dynamically. |  | MailAuthenticator
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Sets the Mail configuration |  | MailConfiguration
| *connectionTimeout* (advanced) | The connection timeout in milliseconds. | 30000 | int
| *contentType* (advanced) | The mail message content type. Use text/html for HTML mails. | text/plain | String
| *contentTypeResolver* (advanced) | Resolver to determine Content-Type for file attachments. |  | ContentTypeResolver
| *debugMode* (advanced) | Enable debug mode on the underlying mail framework. The SUN Mail framework logs the debug messages to System.out by default. | false | boolean
| *ignoreUnsupportedCharset* (advanced) | Option to let Camel ignore unsupported charset in the local JVM when sending mails. If the charset is unsupported then charset=XXX (where XXX represents the unsupported charset) is removed from the content-type and it relies on the platform default instead. | false | boolean
| *ignoreUriScheme* (advanced) | Option to let Camel ignore unsupported charset in the local JVM when sending mails. If the charset is unsupported then charset=XXX (where XXX represents the unsupported charset) is removed from the content-type and it relies on the platform default instead. | false | boolean
| *javaMailProperties* (advanced) | Sets the java mail options. Will clear any default properties and only use the properties provided for this method. |  | Properties
| *session* (advanced) | Specifies the mail session that camel should use for all mail interactions. Useful in scenarios where mail sessions are created and managed by some other resource, such as a JavaEE container. When using a custom mail session, then the hostname and port from the mail session will be used (if configured on the session). |  | Session
| *useInlineAttachments* (advanced) | Whether to use disposition inline or attachment. | false | boolean
| *headerFilterStrategy* (filter) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *password* (security) | The password for login. See also setAuthenticator(MailAuthenticator). |  | String
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters. |  | SSLContextParameters
| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean
| *username* (security) | The username for login. See also setAuthenticator(MailAuthenticator). |  | String

|===
// endpoint options: END


=== Sample endpoints

Typically, you specify a URI with login credentials as follows (taking
SMTP as an example):

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------
smtp://[username@]host[:port][?password=somepwd]
------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, it is possible to specify both the user name and the
password as query options:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------
smtp://host[:port]?password=somepwd&username=someuser
-----------------------------------------------------

For example:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
smtp://mycompany.mailserver:30?password=tiger&username=scott
------------------------------------------------------------

== Components

- IMAP
- IMAPs
- POP3s
- POP3s
- SMTP
- SMTPs

=== Default ports

Default port numbers are supported. If the port number is omitted, Camel
determines the port number to use based on the protocol.

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Protocol |Default Port Number
|`SMTP` |`25`
|`SMTPS` |`465`
|`POP3` |`110`
|`POP3S` |`995`
|`IMAP` |`143`
|`IMAPS` |`993`
|=======================================================================

== SSL support

The underlying mail framework is responsible for providing SSL support.
 You may either configure SSL/TLS support by completely specifying the
necessary Java Mail API configuration options, or you may provide a
configured SSLContextParameters through the component or endpoint
configuration.

=== Using the JSSE Configuration Utility

The mail component supports SSL/TLS configuration
through the xref:manual::camel-configuration-utilities.adoc[Camel JSSE
Configuration Utility].  This utility greatly decreases the amount of
component specific code you need to write and is configurable at the
endpoint and component levels.  The following examples demonstrate how
to use the utility with the mail component.

=== Configuring JavaMail Directly

Camel uses Jakarta JavaMail, which only trusts certificates issued by well
known Certificate Authorities (the default JVM trust configuration). If
you issue your own certificates, you have to import the CA certificates
into the JVM's Java trust/key store files, override the default JVM
trust/key store files (see `SSLNOTES.txt` in JavaMail for details).

== Mail Message Content

Camel uses the message exchange's IN body as the
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html[MimeMessage]
text content. The body is converted to `String.class`.

Camel copies all of the exchange's IN headers to the
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html[MimeMessage]
headers.

The subject of the
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html[MimeMessage]
can be configured using a header property on the IN message. The code
below demonstrates this:

The same applies for other MimeMessage headers such as recipients, so
you can use a header property as `To`:

When using the MailProducer the send the mail to
server, you should be able to get the message id of the
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html[MimeMessage]
with the key `CamelMailMessageId` from the Camel message header.

== Headers take precedence over pre-configured recipients

The recipients specified in the message headers always take precedence
over recipients pre-configured in the endpoint URI. The idea is that if
you provide any recipients in the message headers, that is what you get.
The recipients pre-configured in the endpoint URI are treated as a
fallback.

In the sample code below, the email message is sent to
`davsclaus@apache.org`, because it takes precedence over the
pre-configured recipient, `info@mycompany.com`. Any `CC` and `BCC`
settings in the endpoint URI are also ignored and those recipients will
not receive any mail. The choice between headers and pre-configured
settings is all or nothing: the mail component _either_ takes the
recipients exclusively from the headers or exclusively from the
pre-configured settings. It is not possible to mix and match headers and
pre-configured settings.

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map<String, Object> headers = new HashMap<String, Object>();
headers.put("to", "davsclaus@apache.org");

template.sendBodyAndHeaders("smtp://admin@localhost?to=info@mycompany.com", "Hello World", headers);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Multiple recipients for easier configuration

It is possible to set multiple recipients using a comma-separated or a
semicolon-separated list. This applies both to header settings and to
settings in an endpoint URI. For example:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map<String, Object> headers = new HashMap<String, Object>();
headers.put("to", "davsclaus@apache.org ; jstrachan@apache.org ; ningjiang@apache.org");
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preceding example uses a semicolon, `;`, as the separator character.

== Setting sender name and email

You can specify recipients in the format, `name <email>`, to include
both the name and the email address of the recipient.

For example, you define the following headers on the a
Message:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
Map headers = new HashMap();
map.put("To", "Claus Ibsen <davsclaus@apache.org>");
map.put("From", "James Strachan <jstrachan@apache.org>");
map.put("Subject", "Camel is cool");
---------------------------------------------------------

== JavaMail API (ex SUN JavaMail)

https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home[JavaMail API] is used
under the hood for consuming and producing mails. +
 We encourage end-users to consult these references when using either
POP3 or IMAP protocol. Note particularly that POP3 has a much more
limited set of features than IMAP.

== Samples

We start with a simple route that sends the messages received from a JMS
queue as emails. The email account is the `admin` account on
`mymailserver.com`.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jms://queue:subscription").to("smtp://admin@mymailserver.com?password=secret");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next sample, we poll a mailbox for new emails once every minute.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
from("imap://admin@mymailserver.com?password=secret&unseen=true&delay=60000")
    .to("seda://mails");
-------------------------------------------------------

== Sending mail with attachment sample


[WARNING]
====
*Attachments are not support by all Camel components*

The _Attachments API_ is based on the Java Activation Framework and is
generally only used by the Mail API. Since many of the other Camel
components do not support attachments, the attachments could potentially
be lost as they propagate along the route. The rule of thumb, therefore,
is to add attachments just before sending a message to the mail
endpoint.
====


The mail component supports attachments. In the sample below, we send a
mail message containing a plain text message with a logo file
attachment.

== SSL sample

In this sample, we want to poll our Google mail inbox for mails. To
download mail onto a local mail client, Google mail requires you to
enable and configure SSL. This is done by logging into your Google mail
account and changing your settings to allow IMAP access. Google have
extensive documentation on how to do this.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("imaps://imap.gmail.com?username=YOUR_USERNAME@gmail.com&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
    + "&delete=false&unseen=true&delay=60000").to("log:newmail");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preceding route polls the Google mail inbox for new mails once every
minute and logs the received messages to the `newmail` logger
category. +
 Running the sample with `DEBUG` logging enabled, we can monitor the
progress in the logs:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2008-05-08 06:32:09,640 DEBUG MailConsumer - Connecting to MailStore imaps//imap.gmail.com:993 (SSL enabled), folder=INBOX
2008-05-08 06:32:11,203 DEBUG MailConsumer - Polling mailfolder: imaps//imap.gmail.com:993 (SSL enabled), folder=INBOX
2008-05-08 06:32:11,640 DEBUG MailConsumer - Fetching 1 messages. Total 1 messages.
2008-05-08 06:32:12,171 DEBUG MailConsumer - Processing message: messageNumber=[332], from=[James Bond <007@mi5.co.uk>], to=YOUR_USERNAME@gmail.com], subject=[...
2008-05-08 06:32:12,187 INFO  newmail - Exchange[MailMessage: messageNumber=[332], from=[James Bond <007@mi5.co.uk>], to=YOUR_USERNAME@gmail.com], subject=[...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Consuming mails with attachment sample

In this sample we poll a mailbox and store all attachments from the
mails as files. First, we define a route to poll the mailbox. As this
sample is based on google mail, it uses the same route as shown in the
SSL sample:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("imaps://imap.gmail.com?username=YOUR_USERNAME@gmail.com&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
    + "&delete=false&unseen=true&delay=60000").process(new MyMailProcessor());
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of logging the mail we use a processor where we can process the
mail from java code:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    // the API is a bit clunky so we need to loop
    AttachmentMessage attachmentMessage = exchange.getMessage(AttachmentMessage.class);
    Map<String, DataHandler> attachments = attachmentMessage.getAttachments();
    if (attachments.size() > 0) {
        for (String name : attachments.keySet()) {
            DataHandler dh = attachments.get(name);
            // get the file name
            String filename = dh.getName();

            // get the content and convert it to byte[]
            byte[] data = exchange.getContext().getTypeConverter()
                              .convertTo(byte[].class, dh.getInputStream());

            // write the data to a file
            FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(filename);
            out.write(data);
            out.flush();
            out.close();
        }
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see the API to handle attachments is a bit clunky but it's
there so you can get the `javax.activation.DataHandler` so you can
handle the attachments using standard API.

== How to split a mail message with attachments

In this example we consume mail messages which may have a number of
attachments. What we want to do is to use the
Splitter EIP per individual attachment, to process
the attachments separately. For example if the mail message has 5
attachments, we want the Splitter to process five
messages, each having a single attachment. To do this we need to provide
a custom Expression to the
Splitter where we provide a List<Message> that
contains the five messages with the single attachment.

The code is provided out of the box in Camel 2.10 onwards in the
`camel-mail` component. The code is in the class:
`org.apache.camel.component.mail.SplitAttachmentsExpression`, which you
can find the source code
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/components/camel-mail/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/mail/SplitAttachmentsExpression.java[here]

In the Camel route you then need to use this
Expression in the route as shown below:

If you use XML DSL then you need to declare a method call expression in
the Splitter as shown below

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<split>
  <method beanType="org.apache.camel.component.mail.SplitAttachmentsExpression"/>
  <to uri="mock:split"/>
</split>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

You can also split the attachments as byte[] to
be stored as the message body. This is done by creating the expression
with boolean true

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SplitAttachmentsExpression split = SplitAttachmentsExpression(true);
--------------------------------------------------------------------

And then use the expression with the splitter EIP.

== Using custom SearchTerm

You can configure a `searchTerm` on the `MailEndpoint` which allows you
to filter out unwanted mails.

For example to filter mails to contain Camel in either Subject or Text
you can do as follows:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="imaps://mymailseerver?username=foo&password=secret&searchTerm.subjectOrBody=Camel"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean"/>
</route>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice we use the `"searchTerm.subjectOrBody"` as parameter key to
indicate that we want to search on mail subject or body, to contain the
word "Camel". +
 The class `org.apache.camel.component.mail.SimpleSearchTerm` has a
number of options you can configure:

Or to get the new unseen emails going 24 hours back in time you can do.
Notice the "now-24h" syntax. See the table below for more details.

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="imaps://mymailseerver?username=foo&password=secret&searchTerm.fromSentDate=now-24h"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean"/>
</route>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can have multiple searchTerm in the endpoint uri configuration. They
would then be combined together using AND operator, eg so both
conditions must match. For example to get the last unseen emails going
back 24 hours which has Camel in the mail subject you can do:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="imaps://mymailseerver?username=foo&password=secret&searchTerm.subject=Camel&searchTerm.fromSentDate=now-24h"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean"/>
</route>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `SimpleSearchTerm` is designed to be easily configurable from a
POJO, so you can also configure it using a <bean> style in XML

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="mySearchTerm" class="org.apache.camel.component.mail.SimpleSearchTerm">
  <property name="subject" value="Order"/>
  <property name="to" value="acme-order@acme.com"/>
  <property name="fromSentDate" value="now"/>
 </bean>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can then refer to this bean, using #beanId in your Camel route as
shown:

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="imaps://mymailseerver?username=foo&password=secret&searchTerm=#mySearchTerm"/>
  <to uri="bean:myBean"/>
</route>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Java there is a builder class to build compound
`SearchTerms` using the `org.apache.camel.component.mail.SearchTermBuilder`
class. This allows you to build complex terms such as:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------
// we just want the unseen mails which is not spam
SearchTermBuilder builder = new SearchTermBuilder();

builder.unseen().body(Op.not, "Spam").subject(Op.not, "Spam")
  // which was sent from either foo or bar
  .from("foo@somewhere.com").from(Op.or, "bar@somewhere.com");
  // .. and we could continue building the terms

SearchTerm term = builder.build();
--------------------------------------------------------------


== Polling Optimization

*Since Camel 3.1*

The parameter maxMessagePerPoll and fetchSize allow you to restrict the number message that should be processed for each poll.
These parameters should help to prevent bad performance when working with folders that contain a lot of messages.
In previous versions these parameters have been evaluated too late, so that big mailboxes could still cause performance problems.
With Camel 3.1 these parameters are evaluated earlier during the poll to avoid these problems.

== Using headers with additional Java Mail Sender properties

*Since Camel 3.2*

When sending mails, then you can provide dynamic java mail properties for the `JavaMailSender` from
the Exchange as message headers with keys starting with `java.smtp.`.

You can set any of the `java.smtp` properties which you can find in the Java Mail documentation.

For example to provide a dynamic uuid in `java.smtp.from` (SMTP MAIL command):

[source,java]
----
    .setHeader("from", constant("reply2me@foo.com"));
    .setHeader("java.smtp.from", method(UUID.class, "randomUUID"));
    .to("smtp://mymailserver:1234");
----

NOTE: This is only supported when *not* using a custom `JavaMailSender`.
