*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 Kinesis Firehose component supports sending messages to Amazon Kinesis Firehose service (Batch not supported).

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Kinesis Firehose. More information are available
at https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/firehose/[AWS Kinesis Firehose]

[NOTE]
====
The AWS2 Kinesis Firehose component is not supported in OSGI
====

== URI Format

[source,java]
-----------------------------------
aws2-kinesis-firehose://delivery-stream-name[?options]
-----------------------------------

The stream needs to be created prior to it being used. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

== URI Options


// component options: START
The AWS 2 Kinesis Firehose component supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amazonKinesisFirehoseClient* (producer) | *Autowired* Amazon Kinesis Firehose client to use for all requests for this endpoint |  | FirehoseClient
| *cborEnabled* (common) | This option will set the CBOR_ENABLED property during the execution | true | boolean
| *configuration* (producer) | Component configuration |  | KinesisFirehose2Configuration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to do in case the user don't want to send only a record. There are 5 enums and the value can be one of: sendBatchRecord, createDeliveryStream, deleteDeliveryStream, describeDeliveryStream, updateDestination |  | KinesisFirehose2Operations
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Kinesis Firehose client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Kinesis Firehose client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Kinesis Firehose client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which Kinesis Firehose client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *trustAllCertificates* (producer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

// endpoint options: START
The AWS 2 Kinesis Firehose endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

Required Kinesis Firehose component options

You have to provide the FirehoseClient in the
Registry with proxies and relevant credentials
configured.


== Usage

=== Amazon Kinesis Firehose configuration


You then have to reference the FirehoseClient in the `amazonKinesisFirehoseClient` URI option.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-kinesis-firehose://mykinesisdeliverystream?amazonKinesisFirehoseClient=#kinesisClient")
  .to("log:out?showAll=true");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Providing AWS Credentials

It is recommended that the credentials are obtained by using the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html[DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain]
that is the default when creating a new ClientConfiguration instance,
however, a
different http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/AWSCredentialsProvider.html[AWSCredentialsProvider]
can be specified when calling createClient(...).

=== Kinesis Firehose Producer operations

Camel-AWS s3 component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- SendBatchRecord
- CreateDeliveryStream
- DeleteDeliveryStream
- DescribeDeliveryStream
- UpdateDestination

=== Send Batch Records Example

You can send an iterable of Kinesis Record (as the following example shows) or you can send directly a PutRecordBatchRequest POJO instance in the body.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    @Test
    public void testFirehoseBatchRouting() throws Exception {
        Exchange exchange = template.send("direct:start", ExchangePattern.InOnly, new Processor() {
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                List<Record> recs = new ArrayList<Record>();
                Record rec = Record.builder().data(SdkBytes.fromString("Test1", Charset.defaultCharset())).build();
                Record rec1 = Record.builder().data(SdkBytes.fromString("Test2", Charset.defaultCharset())).build();
                recs.add(rec);
                recs.add(rec1);
                exchange.getIn().setBody(recs);
            }
        });
        assertNotNull(exchange.getIn().getBody());
    }

from("direct:start").to("aws2-kinesis-firehose://cc?amazonKinesisFirehoseClient=#FirehoseClient&operation=sendBatchRecord");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the deliveryStream you'll find "Test1Test2".

=== Message headers set by the Kinesis producer on successful storage of a Record

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`CamelAwsKinesisFirehoseRecordId` |`String` |The record ID, as defined in
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html#API_PutRecord_ResponseSyntax[Response Syntax]


|=======================================================================

== Automatic detection of AmazonKinesisFirehose client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an FirehoseClient bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-kinesis</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
