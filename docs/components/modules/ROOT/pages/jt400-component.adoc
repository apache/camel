*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The JT400 component allows you to exchange messages with an IBM i system
using data queues, message queues, or program call. IBM i is the
replacement for AS/400 and iSeries servers.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-jt400</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

To send or receive data from a data queue

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
jt400://user:password@system/QSYS.LIB/LIBRARY.LIB/QUEUE.DTAQ[?options]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To send or receive messages from a message queue

[source,java]

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== JT400 options

// component options: START
The JT400 component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *connectionPool* (advanced) | Default connection pool used by the component. Note that this pool is lazily initialized. This is because in a scenario where the user always provides a pool, it would be wasteful for Camel to initialize and keep an idle pool. |  | AS400ConnectionPool

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. | 500 | long

// endpoint options: END



== Usage

When configured as a data queue consumer endpoint, the endpoint will poll a data
queue on a remote system. For every entry on the data queue, a new
`Exchange` is sent with the entry's data in the _In_ message's body,
formatted either as a `String` or a `byte[]`, depending on the format.
For a provider endpoint, the _In_ message body contents will be put on
the data queue as either raw bytes or text.

When configured as a message queue consumer endpoint, the endpoint will poll
a message queue on a remote system. For every entry on the queue, a new
`Exchange` is sent with the entry's data in the _In_ message's body. The
data is always formatted as a `String`. Note that only new messages will
be processed. That is, any existing messages on the queue that have already
been handled by another program will not be processed by this endpoint.

For a data queue provider endpoint, the _In_ message body contents will be
put on the data queue as either raw bytes or text.

For a message queue provider endpoint, the _In_ message body contents are
presumed to be text and sent to the queue as an informational message.
Inquiry messages or messages requiring a message ID are not supported.

== Connection pool

*Since Camel 2.10*

You can explicit configure a connection pool on the Jt400Component, or as an uri option
on the endpoint.

=== Remote program call (*Camel 2.7*)

This endpoint expects the input to be either a String array or byte[]
array (depending on format) and handles all the CCSID handling through
the native jt400 library mechanisms. A parameter can be _omitted_ by
passing null as the value in its position (the remote program has to
support it). After the program execution the endpoint returns either a
String array or byte[] array with the values as they were returned by
the program (the input only parameters will contain the same data as the
beginning of the invocation). This endpoint does not implement a provider endpoint!

== Message headers

=== Consumer headers when consuming from data queues

The following headers are potentially available. If the values could not
be determined, the headers will not be set
[width="100%",cols="2m,2m,1m,5",options="header"]
|===
| Header constant                          | Header value                      | Type    | Description
| Jt400Endpoint.SENDER_INFORMATION         | "SENDER_INFORMATION"              | String  | Returns the sender information for this data queue entry, or an empty string if not available
|===

=== Consumer headers when consuming from message queues

The following headers are potentially available. If the values could not
be determined, the headers will not be set
[width="100%",cols="2m,2m,1m,5",options="header"]
|===
| Header constant                          | Header value                      | Type    | Description
| Jt400Endpoint.MESSAGE_ID                 | "CamelJt400MessageID"             | String  | The message identifier
| Jt400Endpoint.MESSAGE_FILE               | "CamelJt400MessageFile"           | String  | The message file name
| Jt400Endpoint.MESSAGE_TYPE               | "CamelJt400MessageType"           | Integer | The message type (corresponds to constants defined in the AS400Message class)
| Jt400Endpoint.SENDER_INFORMATION         | "SENDER_INFORMATION"              | String  | The job identifier of the sending job
|===

== Example

In the snippet below, the data for an exchange sent to the
`direct:george` endpoint will be put in the data queue `PENNYLANE` in
library `BEATLES` on a system named `LIVERPOOL`.  +
 Another user connects to the same data queue to receive the information
from the data queue and forward it to the `mock:ringo` endpoint.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Jt400RouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
       from("direct:george").to("jt400://GEORGE:EGROEG@LIVERPOOL/QSYS.LIB/BEATLES.LIB/PENNYLANE.DTAQ");
       from("jt400://RINGO:OGNIR@LIVERPOOL/QSYS.LIB/BEATLES.LIB/PENNYLANE.DTAQ").to("mock:ringo");
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Remote program call example

In the snippet below, the data Exchange sent to the direct:work endpoint
will contain three string that will be used as the arguments for the
program “compute” in the library “assets”. This program will write the
output values in the 2nd and 3rd parameters. All the parameters will be
sent to the direct:play endpoint.

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Jt400RouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
       from("direct:work").to("jt400://GRUPO:ATWORK@server/QSYS.LIB/assets.LIB/compute.PGM?fieldsLength=10,10,512&ouputFieldsIdx=2,3").to(“direct:play”);
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Writing to keyed data queues

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jms:queue:input")
.to("jt400://username:password@system/lib.lib/MSGINDQ.DTAQ?keyed=true");
------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Reading from keyed data queues

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jt400://username:password@system/lib.lib/MSGOUTDQ.DTAQ?keyed=true&searchKey=MYKEY&searchType=GE")
.to("jms:queue:output");
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Writing to message queues

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("jms:queue:input")
.to("jt400://username:password@system/lib.lib/MSGINQ.MSGQ");
