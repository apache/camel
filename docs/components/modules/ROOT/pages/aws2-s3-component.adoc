*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS2 S3 component supports storing and retrieving objects from/to
https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon's S3] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon S3. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon S3].

== URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
aws2-s3://bucketNameOrArn[?options]
------------------------------

The bucket will be created if it don't already exists. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

For example in order to read file `hello.txt` from bucket `helloBucket`, use the following snippet:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-s3://helloBucket?accessKey=yourAccessKey&secretKey=yourSecretKey&prefix=hello.txt")
  .to("file:/var/downloaded");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== URI Options


// component options: START

| *amazonS3Presigner* (common) | *Autowired* An S3 Presigner for Request, used mainly in createDownloadLink operation |  | S3Presigner
| *autoCreateBucket* (common) | Setting the autocreation of the S3 bucket bucketName. This will apply also in case of moveAfterRead option enabled and it will create the destinationBucket if it doesn't exist already. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (common) | The component configuration |  | AWS2S3Configuration
| *overrideEndpoint* (common) | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | boolean
| *pojoRequest* (common) | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not | false | boolean
| *policy* (common) | The policy for this queue to set in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3#setBucketPolicy() method. |  | String
| *proxyHost* (common) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the SQS client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (common) | Specify a proxy port to be used inside the client definition. |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (common) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the S3 client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (common) | The region in which S3 client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *trustAllCertificates* (common) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *uriEndpointOverride* (common) | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option |  | String
| *useDefaultCredentialsProvider* (common) | Set whether the S3 client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | boolean
| *customerAlgorithm* (common) | Define the customer algorithm to use in case CustomerKey is enabled |  | String
| *customerKeyId* (common) | Define the id of Customer key to use in case CustomerKey is enabled |  | String
| *customerKeyMD5* (common) | Define the MD5 of Customer key to use in case CustomerKey is enabled |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *deleteAfterRead* (consumer) | Delete objects from S3 after they have been retrieved. The delete is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not deleted. If this option is false, then the same objects will be retrieve over and over again on the polls. Therefore you need to use the Idempotent Consumer EIP in the route to filter out duplicates. You can filter using the AWS2S3Constants#BUCKET_NAME and AWS2S3Constants#KEY headers, or only the AWS2S3Constants#KEY header. | true | boolean
| *delimiter* (consumer) | The delimiter which is used in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ListObjectsRequest to only consume objects we are interested in. |  | String
| *destinationBucket* (consumer) | Define the destination bucket where an object must be moved when moveAfterRead is set to true. |  | String
| *destinationBucketPrefix* (consumer) | Define the destination bucket prefix to use when an object must be moved and moveAfterRead is set to true. |  | String

| *fileName* (consumer) | To get the object from the bucket with the given file name |  | String
| *includeBody* (consumer) | If it is true, the S3Object exchange will be consumed and put into the body and closed. If false the S3Object stream will be put raw into the body and the headers will be set with the S3 object metadata. This option is strongly related to autocloseBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true because the S3Object stream will be consumed then it will also be closed in case of includeBody false then it will be up to the caller to close the S3Object stream. However setting autocloseBody to true when includeBody is false it will schedule to close the S3Object stream automatically on exchange completion. | true | boolean
| *includeFolders* (consumer) | If it is true, the folders/directories will be consumed. If it is false, they will be ignored, and Exchanges will not be created for those | true | boolean
| *moveAfterRead* (consumer) | Move objects from S3 bucket to a different bucket after they have been retrieved. To accomplish the operation the destinationBucket option must be set. The copy bucket operation is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not moved. | false | boolean
| *prefix* (consumer) | The prefix which is used in the com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ListObjectsRequest to only consume objects we are interested in. |  | String
| *autocloseBody* (consumer) | If this option is true and includeBody is false, then the S3Object.close() method will be called on exchange completion. This option is strongly related to includeBody option. In case of setting includeBody to false and autocloseBody to false, it will be up to the caller to close the S3Object stream. Setting autocloseBody to true, will close the S3Object stream automatically. | true | boolean
| *deleteAfterWrite* (producer) | Delete file object after the S3 file has been uploaded | false | boolean
| *keyName* (producer) | Setting the key name for an element in the bucket through endpoint parameter |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *multiPartUpload* (producer) | If it is true, camel will upload the file with multi part format, the part size is decided by the option of partSize | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to do in case the user don't want to do only an upload. There are 7 enums and the value can be one of: copyObject, listObjects, deleteObject, deleteBucket, listBuckets, getObject, getObjectRange |  | AWS2S3Operations

| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

=== S3 Producer operations

Camel-AWS2-S3 component provides the following operation on the producer side:

- copyObject
- deleteObject
- listBuckets
- deleteBucket
- listObjects
- getObject (this will return an S3Object instance)
- getObjectRange (this will return an S3Object instance)
- createDownloadLink

If you don't specify an operation explicitly the producer will do:
- a single file upload 
- a multipart upload if multiPartUpload option is enabled

=== Advanced AmazonS3 configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the `S3Client` instance configuration, you can
create your own instance and refer to it in your Camel aws2-s3 component configuration:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("aws2-s3://MyBucket?amazonS3Client=#client&delay=5000&maxMessagesPerPoll=5")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Use KMS with the S3 component

To use AWS KMS to encrypt/decrypt data by using AWS infrastructure you can use the options introduced in 2.21.x like in the following example

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("file:tmp/test?fileName=test.txt")
     .setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, constant("testFile"))
     .to("aws2-s3://mybucket?amazonS3Client=#client&useAwsKMS=true&awsKMSKeyId=3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll ask to S3, to use the KMS key 3f0637ad-296a-3dfe-a796-e60654fb128c, to encrypt the file test.txt. When you'll ask to download this file, the decryption will be done directly before the download.

=== Use "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" with the s3 component and IAM

To use AWS Default Credentials Provider, you must first verify that the EC2 in which you are launching the Camel application on has an IAM role associated with it containing the appropriate policies attached to run effectively.
Keep in mind that this feature should only be set to "true" on remote instances. To clarify even further, you must still use static credentials locally since IAM is an AWS specific component,
but AWS environments should now be easier to manage. After this is implemented and understood, you can set the query parameter "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" to "true" for AWS environments! To effectively toggle this
on and off based on local and remote environments, you can consider enabling this query parameter with system environment variables. For example, your code could set the "useDefaultCredentialsProvider" query parameter to "true",
when the system environment variable called "isRemote" is set to true (there are many other ways to do this and this should act as a simple example). Although it doesn't take away the need for static credentials completely,
using IAM credentials on AWS environments takes away the need to refresh on remote environments and adds a major security boost (IAM credentials are refreshed automatically every 6 hours and update when their
policies are updated). This is the AWS recommended way to manage credentials and therefore should be used as often as possible.

=== S3 Producer Operation examples

- Single Upload: This operation will upload a file to S3 based on the body content

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("direct:start").process(new Processor() {
                    
      @Override
      public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
          exchange.getIn().setHeader(S3Constants.KEY, "camel.txt");
          exchange.getIn().setBody("Camel rocks!");
      }
  })
  .to("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client")
  .to("mock:result");

This operation will return a download link url for the file camel-key in the bucket mycamelbucket and region region

== Bucket Autocreation

With the option `autoCreateBucket` users are able to avoid the autocreation of an S3 Bucket in case it doesn't exist. The default for this option is `true`.
If set to false any operation on a not-existent bucket in AWS won't be successful and an error will be returned.

== Automatic detection of AmazonS3 client in registry

The component is capable of detecting the presence of an AmazonS3 bean into the registry.
If it's the only instance of that type it will be used as client and you won't have to define it as uri parameter, like the example above.
This may be really useful for smarter configuration of the endpoint.

== Moving stuff between a bucket and another bucket

Some users like to consume stuff from a bucket and move the content in a different one without using the copyObject feature of this component.
If this is case for you, don't forget to remove the bucketName header from the incoming exchange of the consumer, otherwise the file will be always overwritten on the same 
original bucket.

== MoveAfterRead consumer option

In addition to deleteAfterRead it has been added another option, moveAfterRead. With this option enabled the consumed object will be moved to a target destinationBucket instead of being only deleted.
This will require specifying the destinationBucket option. As example:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&moveAfterRead=true&destinationBucket=myothercamelbucket")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case the objects consumed will be moved to myothercamelbucket bucket and deleted from the original one (because of deleteAfterRead set to true as default).

You have also the possibility of using a key prefix/suffix while moving the file to a different bucket. The options are destinationBucketPrefix and destinationBucketSuffix.

Taking the above example, you could do something like:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from("aws2-s3://mycamelbucket?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&moveAfterRead=true&destinationBucket=myothercamelbucket&destinationBucketPrefix=RAW(pre-)&destinationBucketSuffix=RAW(-suff)")
  .to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this case the objects consumed will be moved to myothercamelbucket bucket and deleted from the original one (because of deleteAfterRead set to true as default).

So if the file name is test, in the myothercamelbucket you should see a file called pre-test-suff.

== Using customer key as encryption

We introduced also the customer key support (an alternative of using KMS). The following code shows an example.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String key = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
byte[] secretKey = generateSecretKey();
String b64Key = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(secretKey);
String b64KeyMd5 = Md5Utils.md5AsBase64(secretKey);

String awsEndpoint = "aws2-s3://mycamel?autoCreateBucket=false&useCustomerKey=true&customerKeyId=RAW(" + b64Key + ")&customerKeyMD5=RAW(" + b64KeyMd5 + ")&customerAlgorithm=" + AES256.name();

from("direct:putObject")
    .setHeader(AWS2S3Constants.KEY, constant("test.txt"))
    .setBody(constant("Test"))
    .to(awsEndpoint);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Using a POJO as body

Sometimes build an AWS Request can be complex, because of multiple options. We introduce the possibility to use a POJO as body.
In AWS S3 there are multiple operations you can submit, as an example for List brokers request, you can do something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:aws2-s3")
     .setBody(ListObjectsRequest.builder().bucket(bucketName).build())
     .to("aws2-s3://test?amazonS3Client=#amazonS3Client&operation=listObjects&pojoRequest=true")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this way you'll pass the request directly without the need of passing headers and options specifically related to this operation.

== Create S3 client and add component to registry
Sometimes you would want to perform some advanced configuration using AWS2S3Configuration which also allows to set the S3 client. 
You can create and set the S3 client in the component configuration as shown in the following example

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String awsBucketAccessKey = "your_access_key";
String awsBucketSecretKey = "your_secret_key";

S3Client s3Client = S3Client.builder().credentialsProvider(StaticCredentialsProvider.create(AwsBasicCredentials.create(awsBucketAccessKey, awsBucketSecretKey)))
                .region(Region.US_EAST_1).build();

AWS2S3Configuration configuration = new AWS2S3Configuration();
configuration.setAmazonS3Client(s3Client);
configuration.setAutoDiscoverClient(true);
configuration.setBucketName("s3bucket2020");
configuration.setRegion("us-east-1");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can configure the S3 component (using the configuration object created above) and add it to the registry in the 
configure method before initialization of routes.

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS2S3Component s3Component = new AWS2S3Component(getContext());
s3Component.setConfiguration(configuration);
s3Component.setLazyStartProducer(true);
camelContext.addComponent("aws2-s3", s3Component);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now your component will be used for all the operations implemented in camel routes.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-aws2-s3</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `$\{camel-version}` must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.
