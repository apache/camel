= Spring Cloud Netflix
//THIS FILE IS COPIED: EDIT THE SOURCE FILE:

*Available as of Camel 2.19*

The Spring Cloud Netflix component bridges Camel Cloud and Spring Cloud Netflix so you can leverage Spring Cloud Netflix service discovery and load balance features in Camel and/or you can use Camel Service Discovery implementations as ServerList source for Spring Cloud Netflix's Ribbon load balabncer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` in order to use this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring-cloud-netflix</artifactId>
    <version>${camel.version}</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

`camel-spring-cloud-netflix` jar comes with theÂ `spring.factories` file, so as soon as you add that dependency into your classpath, Spring Boot will automatically auto-configure Camel for you.

You can disable Camel Spring Cloud Netflix with the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
# Enable/Disable the whole integration, default true
camel.cloud.netflix = true

# Enable/Disable the integration with Ribbon, default true
camel.cloud.netflix.ribbon = true
----
