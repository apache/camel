*Since Camel 2.17*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Ignite Messaging endpoint is one of camel-ignite endpoints which allows you to send and consume messages from an https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/messaging[Ignite topic].

This endpoint supports producers (to send messages) and consumers (to receive messages).

== Options

// component options: START
The Ignite Messaging component supports 6 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configurationResource* (common) | Resource from where to load configuration. |  | Object
| *ignite* (common) | Ignite instance. |  | Ignite
| *igniteConfiguration* (common) | Ignite configuration. |  | IgniteConfiguration
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Ignite Messaging endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
ignite-messaging:topic

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *topic* | *Required* The topic name. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (11 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *propagateIncomingBodyIfNo ReturnValue* (common) | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | boolean
| *treatCollectionsAsCacheObjects* (common) | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute, etc. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *clusterGroupExpression* (producer) | The cluster group expression. |  | ClusterGroupExpression
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *sendMode* (producer) | The send mode to use. Possible values: UNORDERED, ORDERED. The value can be one of: ORDERED, UNORDERED | UNORDERED | IgniteMessagingSendMode
| *timeout* (producer) | The timeout for the send operation when using ordered messages. |  | Long
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean

=== Headers used

This endpoint uses the following headers:
[width="100%",cols="1,1,1,4",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Header name | Constant | Expected type | Description
| CamelIgniteMessagingTopic | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_MESSAGING_TOPIC | String |
Allows you to dynamically change the topic to send messages to (producer). 
It also carries the topic on which a message was received (consumer).

| CamelIgniteMessagingUUID | IgniteConstants.IGNITE_MESSAGING_UUID | UUID |
This header is filled in with the UUID of the subscription when a message arrives (consumer).
