*Since Camel 2.23*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The FHIR component integrates with the
http://hapifhir.io/[HAPI-FHIR] library which is an open-source implementation of the
http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/[FHIR] (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) specification in Java.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-fhir</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== URI Format

The FHIR Component uses the following URI format:

[source,text]
----
fhir://endpoint-prefix/endpoint?[options]
----

Endpoint prefix can be one of:

* capabilities
* create
* delete
* history
* load-page
* meta
* operation
* patch
* read
* search
* transaction
* update
* validate


// component options: START
The FHIR component supports 4 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *configuration* (common) | To use the shared configuration |  | FhirConfiguration
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The FHIR endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean

| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.

| *socketTimeout* (advanced) | How long to block for individual read/write operations (in ms) | 10000 | Integer

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. You can also specify time values using units, such as 60s (60 seconds), 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds), and 1h (1 hour). | 500 | long
