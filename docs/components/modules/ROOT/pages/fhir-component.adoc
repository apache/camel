= FHIR Component
:page-source: components/camel-fhir/camel-fhir-component/src/main/docs/fhir-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.23*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The FHIR component integrates with the
http://hapifhir.io/[HAPI-FHIR] library which is an open-source implementation of the
http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/[FHIR] (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) specification in Java.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-fhir</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== URI Format

The FHIR Component uses the following URI format:

[source,text]
----
fhir://endpoint-prefix/endpoint?[options]
----

Endpoint prefix can be one of:

* capabilities
* create
* delete
* history
* load-page
* meta
* operation
* patch
* read
* search
* transaction
* update
* validate


// component options: START
The FHIR component supports 27 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *encoding* (common) | Encoding to use for all request. The value can be one of: JSON, XML |  | String
| *fhirVersion* (common) | The FHIR Version to use. The value can be one of: DSTU2, DSTU2_HL7ORG, DSTU2_1, DSTU3, R4, R5 | R4 | String
| *log* (common) | Will log every requests and responses | false | boolean
| *prettyPrint* (common) | Pretty print all request | false | boolean
| *serverUrl* (common) | The FHIR server base URL |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *client* (advanced) | To use the custom client |  | IGenericClient
| *clientFactory* (advanced) | To use the custom client factory |  | IRestfulClientFactory
| *compress* (advanced) | Compresses outgoing (POST/PUT) contents to the GZIP format | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | To use the shared configuration |  | FhirConfiguration
| *connectionTimeout* (advanced) | How long to try and establish the initial TCP connection (in ms) | 10000 | Integer
| *deferModelScanning* (advanced) | When this option is set, model classes will not be scanned for children until the child list for the given type is actually accessed. | false | boolean
| *fhirContext* (advanced) | FhirContext is an expensive object to create. To avoid creating multiple instances, it can be set directly. |  | FhirContext
| *forceConformanceCheck* (advanced) | Force conformance check | false | boolean
| *sessionCookie* (advanced) | HTTP session cookie to add to every request |  | String
| *socketTimeout* (advanced) | How long to block for individual read/write operations (in ms) | 10000 | Integer
| *summary* (advanced) | Request that the server modify the response using the _summary param. The value can be one of: COUNT, TEXT, DATA, TRUE, FALSE |  | String
| *validationMode* (advanced) | When should Camel validate the FHIR Server's conformance statement. The value can be one of: NEVER, ONCE | ONCE | String
| *proxyHost* (proxy) | The proxy host |  | String
| *proxyPassword* (proxy) | The proxy password |  | String
| *proxyPort* (proxy) | The proxy port |  | Integer
| *proxyUser* (proxy) | The proxy username |  | String
| *accessToken* (security) | OAuth access token |  | String
| *password* (security) | Username to use for basic authentication |  | String
| *username* (security) | Username to use for basic authentication |  | String

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
