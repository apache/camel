= Stomp Component
:page-source: components/camel-stomp/src/main/docs/stomp-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.12*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Stomp component is used for communicating with
http://stomp.github.io/[Stomp] compliant message brokers, like
http://activemq.apache.org[Apache ActiveMQ] or
http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/[ActiveMQ Apollo]

*Note:* Since STOMP specification is not actively maintained, please note https://github.com/fusesource/stompjms/tree/master/stompjms-client[STOMP JMS client]
is not as well actively maintained. However, we hope for the community to step up to help on maintaining the STOMP JMS project in the near future.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-stomp</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
---------------------------------
stomp:queue:destination[?options]
---------------------------------

Where *destination* is the name of the queue.

== Options



// component options: START
The Stomp component supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *brokerURL* (common) | *Required* The URI of the Stomp broker to connect to | tcp://localhost:61613 | String
| *customHeaders* (common) | To set custom headers |  | Properties
| *host* (common) | The virtual host name |  | String
| *version* (common) | The stomp version (1.1, or 1.2) |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *configuration* (advanced) | Component configuration. |  | StompConfiguration
| *headerFilterStrategy* (filter) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *login* (security) | The username |  | String
| *passcode* (security) | The password |  | String
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters |  | SSLContextParameters
| *useGlobalSslContextParameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean

// endpoint options: START
The Stomp endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
stomp:destination
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *destination* | *Required* Name of the queue |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (14 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *brokerURL* (common) | *Required* The URI of the Stomp broker to connect to | tcp://localhost:61613 | String
| *customHeaders* (common) | To set custom headers |  | Properties
| *host* (common) | The virtual host name |  | String
| *version* (common) | The stomp version (1.1, or 1.2) |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *headerFilterStrategy* (advanced) | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *login* (security) | The username |  | String
| *passcode* (security) | The password |  | String
| *sslContextParameters* (security) | To configure security using SSLContextParameters |  | SSLContextParameters
|===
// endpoint options: END




You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Samples

Sending messages:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------
from("direct:foo").to("stomp:queue:test");
------------------------------------------

Consuming messages:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("stomp:queue:test").transform(body().convertToString()).to("mock:result")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Endpoints

Camel supports the Message Endpoint pattern
using the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface. Endpoints are usually created by a
Component and Endpoints are usually referred to in
the DSL via their URIs.

From an Endpoint you can use the following methods

*
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createProducer--[createProducer()]
will create a
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Producer.html[Producer]
for sending message exchanges to the endpoint
*
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createConsumer-org.apache.camel.Processor-[createConsumer()]
implements the Event Driven Consumer
pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a

when creating a

*
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createPollingConsumer--[createPollingConsumer()]
implements the Polling Consumer pattern for
consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
