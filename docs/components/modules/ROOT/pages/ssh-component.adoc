*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The SSH component enables access to SSH servers such that you can send
an SSH command, and process the response.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-ssh</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== Options



// component options: START
The SSH component supports 17 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *failOnUnknownHost* (common) | Specifies whether a connection to an unknown host should fail or not. This value is only checked when the property knownHosts is set. | false | boolean
| *knownHostsResource* (common) | Sets the resource path for a known_hosts file |  | String
| *timeout* (common) | Sets the timeout in milliseconds to wait in establishing the remote SSH server connection. Defaults to 30000 milliseconds. | 30000 | long
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *pollCommand* (consumer) | Sets the command string to send to the remote SSH server during every poll cycle. Only works with camel-ssh component being used as a consumer, i.e. from(ssh://...) You may need to end your command with a newline, and that must be URL encoded %0A |  | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *channelType* (advanced) | Sets the channel type to pass to the Channel as part of command execution. Defaults to exec. | exec | String
| *configuration* (advanced) | Component configuration |  | SshConfiguration
| *shellPrompt* (advanced) | Sets the shellPrompt to be dropped when response is read after command execution |  | String
| *sleepForShellPrompt* (advanced) | Sets the sleep period in milliseconds to wait reading response from shell prompt. Defaults to 100 milliseconds. | 100 | long
| *certResource* (security) | Sets the resource path of the certificate to use for Authentication. Will use ResourceHelperKeyPairProvider to resolve file based certificate, and depends on keyType setting. |  | String
| *certResourcePassword* (security) | Sets the password to use in loading certResource, if certResource is an encrypted key. |  | String
| *keyPairProvider* (security) | Sets the KeyPairProvider reference to use when connecting using Certificates to the remote SSH Server. |  | KeyPairProvider
| *keyType* (security) | Sets the key type to pass to the KeyPairProvider as part of authentication. KeyPairProvider.loadKey(...) will be passed this value. From Camel 3.0.0 / 2.25.0, by default Camel will select the first available KeyPair that is loaded. Prior to this, a KeyType of 'ssh-rsa' was enforced by default. |  | String
| *password* (security) | Sets the password to use in connecting to remote SSH server. Requires keyPairProvider to be set to null. |  | String
| *username* (security) | Sets the username to use in logging into the remote SSH server. |  | String

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int

== Usage as a Producer endpoint

When the SSH Component is used as a Producer (`.to("ssh://...")`), it
will send the message body as the command to execute on the remote SSH
server.

Here is an example of this within the XML DSL. Note that the command has
an XML encoded newline (`+&#10;+`).

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------
<route id="camel-example-ssh-producer">
  <from uri="direct:exampleSshProducer"/>
  <setBody>
    <constant>features:list&#10;</constant>
  </setBody>
  <to uri="ssh://karaf:karaf@localhost:8101"/>
  <log message="${body}"/>
</route>
----------------------------------------------

== Authentication

The SSH Component can authenticate against the remote SSH server using
one of two mechanisms: Public Key certificate or username/password.
Configuring how the SSH Component does authentication is based on how
and which options are set.

1.  First, it will look to see if the `certResource` option has been
set, and if so, use it to locate the referenced Public Key certificate
and use that for authentication.
2.  If `certResource` is not set, it will look to see if a
`keyPairProvider` has been set, and if so, it will use that for
certificate based authentication.
3.  If neither `certResource` nor `keyPairProvider` are set, it will use
the `username` and `password` options for authentication. Even though the `username` 
and `password` are provided in the endpoint configuration and headers set with 
`SshConstants.USERNAME_HEADER` (`CamelSshUsername`) and 
`SshConstants.PASSWORD_HEADER` (`CamelSshPassword`), the endpoint 
configuration is surpassed and credentials set in the headers are used.

The following route fragment shows an SSH polling consumer using a
certificate from the classpath.

In the XML DSL,

[source,xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<route>
  <from uri="ssh://scott@localhost:8101?certResource=classpath:test_rsa&amp;useFixedDelay=true&amp;delay=5000&amp;pollCommand=features:list%0A"/>
  <log message="${body}"/>
</route>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Java DSL,

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("ssh://scott@localhost:8101?certResource=classpath:test_rsa&useFixedDelay=true&delay=5000&pollCommand=features:list%0A")
    .log("${body}");
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of using Public Key authentication is provided in
`examples/camel-example-ssh-security`.

[[SSH-CertificateDependencies]]
== Certificate Dependencies

You will need to add some additional runtime dependencies if you use
certificate based authentication. You may need to use later versions depending what version
of Camel you are using.

The component uses `sshd-core` library which is based on either `bouncycastle` or `eddsa` security providers. `camel-ssh` is picking explicitly `bouncycastle` as security provider.

[source,xml]
-----------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.sshd</groupId>
  <artifactId>sshd-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
  <artifactId>bcpg-jdk15on</artifactId>
  <version>1.65</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
  <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
  <version>1.65</version>
</dependency>
