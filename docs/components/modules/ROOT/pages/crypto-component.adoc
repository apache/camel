== Crypto (JCE) Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.3*

With Camel cryptographic endpoints and Java's Cryptographic extension it
is easy to create Digital Signatures for Exchanges.
Camel provides a pair of flexible endpoints which get used in concert to
create a signature for an exchange in one part of the exchange's
workflow and then verify the signature in a later part of the workflow.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-crypto</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

### Introduction

Digital signatures make use of Asymmetric Cryptographic techniques to
sign messages. From a (very) high level, the algorithms use pairs of
complimentary keys with the special property that data encrypted with
one key can only be decrypted with the other. One, the private key, is
closely guarded and used to 'sign' the message while the other, public
key, is shared around to anyone interested in verifying the signed
messages. Messages are signed by using the private key to encrypting a
digest of the message. This encrypted digest is transmitted along with
the message. On the other side the verifier recalculates the message
digest and uses the public key to decrypt the digest in the
signature. If both digests match the verifier knows only the holder of
the private key could have created the signature.

Camel uses the Signature service from the Java Cryptographic Extension
to do all the heavy cryptographic lifting required to create exchange
signatures. The following are some excellent resources for explaining
the mechanics of Cryptography, Message digests and Digital Signatures
and how to leverage them with the JCE.

### URI format

As mentioned Camel provides a pair of crypto endpoints to create and
verify signatures

[source,java]
----------------------------
crypto:sign:name[?options]
crypto:verify:name[?options]
----------------------------

* `crypto:sign` creates the signature and stores it in the Header keyed
by the constant
`org.apache.camel.component.crypto.DigitalSignatureConstants.SIGNATURE`,
i.e. `"CamelDigitalSignature"`.
* `crypto:verify` will read in the contents of this header and do the
verification calculation.

In order to correctly function, the sign and verify process needs a pair
of keys to be shared, signing requiring a `PrivateKey` and verifying a
`PublicKey` (or a `Certificate` containing one). Using the JCE it is
very simple to generate these key pairs but it is usually most secure to
use a KeyStore to house and share your keys. The DSL is very flexible
about how keys are supplied and provides a number of mechanisms.

Note a `crypto:sign` endpoint is typically defined in one route and the
complimentary `crypto:verify` in another, though for simplicity in the
examples they appear one after the other. It goes without saying that
both signing and verifying should be configured identically.

### Using

#### Raw keys

The most basic way to way to sign and verify an exchange is with a
KeyPair as follows.

The same can be achieved with the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring
XML Extensions] using references to keys

#### KeyStores and Aliases.

The JCE provides a very versatile keystore concept for housing pairs of
private keys and certificates, keeping them encrypted and password
protected. They can be retrieved by applying an alias to the retrieval
APIs. There are a number of ways to get keys and Certificates into a
keystore, most often this is done with the external 'keytool'
application.
http://www.exampledepot.com/egs/java.security.cert/CreateCert.html[This]
is a good example of using keytool to create a KeyStore with a self
signed Cert and Private key.

The examples use a Keystore with a key and cert aliased by 'bob'. The
password for the keystore and the key is 'letmein'

The following shows how to use a Keystore via the Fluent builders, it
also shows how to load and initialize the keystore.

Again in Spring a ref is used to lookup an actual keystore instance.

#### Changing JCE Provider and Algorithm

Changing the Signature algorithm or the Security provider is a simple
matter of specifying their names. You will need to also use Keys that
are compatible with the algorithm you choose.

or

#### Changing the Signature Message Header

It may be desirable to change the message header used to store the
signature. A different header name can be specified in the route
definition as follows

or

#### Changing the buffersize

In case you need to update the size of the buffer...

or

#### Supplying Keys dynamically.

When using a Recipient list or similar EIP the recipient of an exchange
can vary dynamically. Using the same key across all recipients may be
neither feasible nor desirable. It would be useful to be able to specify
signature keys dynamically on a per-exchange basis. The exchange could
then be dynamically enriched with the key of its target recipient prior
to signing. To facilitate this the signature mechanisms allow for keys
to be supplied dynamically via the message headers below

* `Exchange.SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `"CamelSignaturePrivateKey"`
* `Exchange.SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY_OR_CERT`, `"CamelSignaturePublicKeyOrCert"`

or

Even better would be to dynamically supply a keystore alias. Again the
alias can be supplied in a message header

* `Exchange.KEYSTORE_ALIAS`, `"CamelSignatureKeyStoreAlias"`

or

The header would be set as follows

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exchange unsigned = getMandatoryEndpoint("direct:alias-sign").createExchange();
unsigned.getIn().setBody(payload);
unsigned.getIn().setHeader(DigitalSignatureConstants.KEYSTORE_ALIAS, "bob");
unsigned.getIn().setHeader(DigitalSignatureConstants.KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, "letmein".toCharArray());
template.send("direct:alias-sign", unsigned);
Exchange signed = getMandatoryEndpoint("direct:alias-sign").createExchange();
signed.getIn().copyFrom(unsigned.getOut());
signed.getIn().setHeader(KEYSTORE_ALIAS, "bob");
template.send("direct:alias-verify", signed);
