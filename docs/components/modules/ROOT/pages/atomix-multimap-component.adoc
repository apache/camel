*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The camel Atomix-Multimap component allows you to work with http://atomix.io[Atomix's] https://atomix.io/docs/latest/user-manual/primitives/DistributedMultimap/[Distributed MultiMap] collection.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-atomix</artifactId>
        <version>${camel-version}</version>
    </dependency>

== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END
// component options: START
== Component Options


The Atomix MultiMap component supports 17 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *atomix* (producer) | The Atomix instance to use |  | Atomix
| *configuration* (producer) | The shared component configuration |  | AtomixMultiMapConfiguration
| *configurationUri* (producer) | The path to the AtomixClient configuration |  | String
| *defaultAction* (producer) | The default action. There are 8 enums and the value can be one of: PUT, GET, CLEAR, SIZE, CONTAINS_KEY, IS_EMPTY, REMOVE, REMOVE_VALUE | PUT | Action
| *key* (producer) | The key to use if none is set in the header or to listen for events for a specific key. |  | Object
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *nodes* (producer) | The nodes the AtomixClient should connect to |  | List
| *resultHeader* (producer) | The header that wil carry the result. |  | String
| *transportClassName* (producer) | The class name (fqn) of the Atomix transport | io.atomix.catalyst.transport.netty.NettyTransport | String
| *ttl* (producer) | The resource ttl. |  | long
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *defaultResourceConfig* (advanced) | The cluster wide default resource configuration. |  | Properties
| *defaultResourceOptions* (advanced) | The local default resource options. |  | Properties
| *ephemeral* (advanced) | Sets if the local member should join groups as PersistentMember or not. If set to ephemeral the local member will receive an auto generated ID thus the local one is ignored. | false | boolean
| *readConsistency* (advanced) | The read consistency level. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of: ATOMIC, ATOMIC_LEASE, SEQUENTIAL, LOCAL |  | ReadConsistency
| *resourceConfigs* (advanced) | Cluster wide resources configuration. |  | Map
| *resourceOptions* (advanced) | Local resources configurations |  | Map

== Endpoint Options

The Atomix MultiMap endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
atomix-multimap:resourceName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *resourceName* | *Required* The distributed resource name |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (15 parameters):
