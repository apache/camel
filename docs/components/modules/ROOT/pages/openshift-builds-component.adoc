:page-source: components/camel-kubernetes/src/main/docs/openshift-builds-component.adoc

*Since Camel 2.17*

// HEADER START
*Only producer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Kubernetes Builds component is one of xref:kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes Components] which
provides a producer to execute kubernetes build operations.


== Component Options

// component options: START
The Openshift Builds component supports 3 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean

== Endpoint Options

// endpoint options: START
The Openshift Builds endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
openshift-builds:masterUrl
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

== Supported producer operation

- listBuilds
- listBuildsByLabels
- getBuild

== Openshift Builds Producer Examples

- listBuilds: this operation list the Builds on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:list").
    toF("openshift-builds:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuilds").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Builds from your Openshift cluster

- listBuildsByLabels: this operation list the builds by labels on an Openshift cluster

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:listByLabels").process(new Processor() {

            @Override
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                Map<String, String> labels = new HashMap<>();
                labels.put("key1", "value1");
                labels.put("key2", "value2");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_BUILDS_LABELS, labels);
            }
        });
    toF("openshift-builds:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listBuildsByLabels").
    to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This operation return a List of Builds from your cluster, using a label selector (with key1 and key2, with value value1 and value2)
