=== Development Notes (Important)
When developing on this component, you will need to obtain your Azure accessKey in order to run the integration tests. In addition to the mocked unit tests
you *will need to run the integration tests with every change you make or even client upgrade as the Azure client can break things even on minor versions upgrade.*
To run the integration tests, on this component directory, run the following maven command:
----
mvn verify -PfullTests -DconnectionString=string -DblobAccountName=blob -DblobAccessKey=key
----
Whereby `blobAccountName` is your Azure account name and `blobAccessKey` is the access key being generated from Azure portal and `connectionString` is the eventHub connection string.
