*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Dataformat component allows to use xref:manual::data-format.adoc[Data
Format] as a Camel Component.

== URI format

[source]
----
dataformat:name:(marshal|unmarshal)[?options]
----

Where *name* is the name of the Data Format. And
then followed by the operation which must either be `marshal` or
`unmarshal`. The options is used for configuring the xref:manual::data-format.adoc[Data
Format] in use. See the Data Format documentation
for which options it support.

== DataFormat Options


// component options: START
The Data Format component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END



// endpoint options: START
The Data Format endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
dataformat:name:operation
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *name* | *Required* Name of data format |  | String
| *operation* | *Required* Operation to use either marshal or unmarshal. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: marshal, unmarshal |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (2 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Samples

For example to use the xref:dataformats:jaxb-dataformat.adoc[JAXB] xref:manual::data-format.adoc[Data
Format] we can do as follows:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("dataformat:jaxb:unmarshal?contextPath=com.acme.model").
  to("mqseries:Another.Queue");
----

And in XML DSL you do:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route>
    <from uri="activemq:My.Queue"/>
    <to uri="dataformat:jaxb:unmarshal?contextPath=com.acme.model"/>
    <to uri="mqseries:Another.Queue"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
