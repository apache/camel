*Since Camel 2.10*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

The Twitter Direct Message Component consumes/produces a user's direct messages.

== Component Options

// component options: START
The Twitter Direct Message component supports 11 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *httpProxyHost* (proxy) | The http proxy host which can be used for the camel-twitter. |  | String
| *httpProxyPassword* (proxy) | The http proxy password which can be used for the camel-twitter. |  | String
| *httpProxyPort* (proxy) | The http proxy port which can be used for the camel-twitter. |  | int
| *httpProxyUser* (proxy) | The http proxy user which can be used for the camel-twitter. |  | String
| *accessToken* (security) | The access token |  | String
| *accessTokenSecret* (security) | The access token secret |  | String
| *consumerKey* (security) | The consumer key |  | String
| *consumerSecret* (security) | The consumer secret |  | String

== Endpoint Options

// endpoint options: START
The Twitter Direct Message endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
twitter-directmessage:user
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *user* | *Required* The user name to send a direct message. This will be ignored for consumer. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (44 parameters):

| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *type* (consumer) | Endpoint type to use. The value can be one of: polling, direct | polling | EndpointType
| *distanceMetric* (consumer) | Used by the geography search, to search by radius using the configured metrics. The unit can either be mi for miles, or km for kilometers. You need to configure all the following options: longitude, latitude, radius, and distanceMetric. The value can be one of: km, mi | km | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. The value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *extendedMode* (consumer) | Used for enabling full text from twitter (eg receive tweets that contains more than 140 characters). | true | boolean
| *latitude* (consumer) | Used by the geography search to search by latitude. You need to configure all the following options: longitude, latitude, radius, and distanceMetric. |  | Double
| *locations* (consumer) | Bounding boxes, created by pairs of lat/lons. Can be used for filter. A pair is defined as lat,lon. And multiple paris can be separated by semi colon. |  | String
| *longitude* (consumer) | Used by the geography search to search by longitude. You need to configure all the following options: longitude, latitude, radius, and distanceMetric. |  | Double
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *radius* (consumer) | Used by the geography search to search by radius. You need to configure all the following options: longitude, latitude, radius, and distanceMetric. |  | Double
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.

| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *count* (filter) | Limiting number of results per page. | 5 | Integer
