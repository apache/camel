*Since Camel 2.12*

// HEADER START
*Both producer and consumer is supported*
// HEADER END

This component supports producer and consumer endpoints to communicate
with Salesforce using Java DTOs.  +
 There is a companion maven plugin Camel Salesforce Plugin that
generates these DTOs (see further below).

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-salesforce</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
Developers wishing to contribute to the component are instructed
to look at the https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components/camel-salesforce/camel-salesforce-component/README.md[README.md] file on instructions on how to get started and
setup your environment for running integration tests.
====

== Authenticating to Salesforce

The component supports three OAuth authentication flows:

* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_username_password_flow.htm[OAuth 2.0 Username-Password Flow]
* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_refresh_token_flow.htm[OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token Flow]
* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm[OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Token Flow]

For each of the flow different set of properties needs to be set:

.Properties to set for each authentication flow
|===
| Property     | Where to find it on Salesforce     | Flow

| clientId     | Connected App, Consumer Key        | All flows
| clientSecret | Connected App, Consumer Secret     | Username-Password, Refresh Token
| userName     | Salesforce user username           | Username-Password, JWT Bearer Token
| password     | Salesforce user password           | Username-Password
| refreshToken | From OAuth flow callback           | Refresh Token
| keystore     | Connected App, Digital Certificate | JWT Bearer Token
|===

The component auto determines what flow you're trying to configure, to
be remove ambiguity set the `authenticationType` property.

[NOTE]
====
Using Username-Password Flow in production is not encouraged.
====

[NOTE]
====
The certificate used in JWT Bearer Token Flow can be a selfsigned 
certificate. The KeyStore holding the certificate and the private key
must contain only single certificate-private key entry.
====

== URI format

When used as a consumer, receiving streaming events, the URI scheme is:

[source,java]
----
salesforce:topic?options
----

When used as a producer, invoking the Salesforce REST APIs, the URI
scheme is:

[source,java]
----
salesforce:operationName?options
----

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

== Passing in Salesforce headers and fetching Salesforce response headers

There is support to pass https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/headers.htm[Salesforce headers]
via inbound message headers, header names that start with `Sforce` or
`x-sfdc` on the Camel message will be passed on in the request, and
response headers that start with `Sforce` will be present in the outbound
message headers.

For example to fetch API limits you can specify:

[source,java]
----
// in your Camel route set the header before Salesforce endpoint
//...
  .setHeader("Sforce-Limit-Info", constant("api-usage"))
  .to("salesforce:getGlobalObjects")
  .to(myProcessor);

// myProcessor will receive `Sforce-Limit-Info` header on the outbound
// message
class MyProcessor implements Processor {
    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
        Message in = exchange.getIn();
        String apiLimits = in.getHeader("Sforce-Limit-Info", String.class);
   }
}
----

== Supported Salesforce APIs

The component supports the following Salesforce APIs

Producer endpoints can use the following APIs. Most of the APIs process
one record at a time, the Query API can retrieve multiple Records.

=== Rest API

You can use the following for `operationName`:

* getVersions - Gets supported Salesforce REST API versions
* getResources - Gets available Salesforce REST Resource endpoints
* getGlobalObjects - Gets metadata for all available SObject types
* getBasicInfo - Gets basic metadata for a specific SObject type
* getDescription - Gets comprehensive metadata for a specific SObject
type
* getSObject - Gets an SObject using its Salesforce Id
* createSObject - Creates an SObject
* updateSObject - Updates an SObject using Id
* deleteSObject - Deletes an SObject using Id
* getSObjectWithId - Gets an SObject using an external (user defined) id
field
* upsertSObject - Updates or inserts an SObject using an external id
* deleteSObjectWithId - Deletes an SObject using an external id
* query - Runs a Salesforce SOQL query
* queryMore - Retrieves more results (in case of large number of
results) using result link returned from the 'query' API
* search - Runs a Salesforce SOSL query
* limits - fetching organization API usage limits
* recent - fetching recent items
* approval - submit a record or records (batch) for approval process
* approvals - fetch a list of all approval processes
* composite - submit up to 25 possibly related REST requests and receive individual responses
* composite-tree - create up to 200 records with parent-child relationships (up to 5 levels) in one go
* composite-batch - submit a composition of requests in batch
* queryAll - Runs a SOQL query. It returns the results that are deleted because of a merge or delete. Also returns the  information about archived Task and Event records.
* getBlobField - Retrieves the specified blob field from an individual record.
* apexCall - Executes a user defined APEX REST API call.

For example, the following producer endpoint uses the upsertSObject API,
with the sObjectIdName parameter specifying 'Name' as the external id
field. 
The request message body should be an SObject DTO generated using the
maven plugin.  
The response message will either be `null` if an existing record was
updated, or `CreateSObjectResult` with an id of the new record, or a
list of errors while creating the new object.

[source,java]
----
...to("salesforce:upsertSObject?sObjectIdName=Name")...
----

=== Rest Bulk API

Producer endpoints can use the following APIs. All Job data formats,
i.e. xml, csv, zip/xml, and zip/csv are supported.  +
 The request and response have to be marshalled/unmarshalled by the
route. Usually the request will be some stream source like a CSV file,
 +
 and the response may also be saved to a file to be correlated with the
request.

You can use the following for `operationName`:

* createJob - Creates a Salesforce Bulk Job
* getJob - Gets a Job using its Salesforce Id
* closeJob - Closes a Job
* abortJob - Aborts a Job
* createBatch - Submits a Batch within a Bulk Job
* getBatch - Gets a Batch using Id
* getAllBatches - Gets all Batches for a Bulk Job Id
* getRequest - Gets Request data (XML/CSV) for a Batch
* getResults - Gets the results of the Batch when its complete
* createBatchQuery - Creates a Batch from an SOQL query
* getQueryResultIds - Gets a list of Result Ids for a Batch Query
* getQueryResult - Gets results for a Result Id
* getRecentReports - Gets up to 200 of the reports you most recently viewed by sending a GET request to the Report List resource.
* getReportDescription - Retrieves the report, report type, and related metadata for a report, either in a tabular or summary or matrix format.
* executeSyncReport - Runs a report synchronously with or without changing filters and returns the latest summary data.
* executeAsyncReport - Runs an instance of a report asynchronously with or without filters and returns the summary data with or without details.
* getReportInstances - Returns a list of instances for a report that you requested to be run asynchronously. Each item in the list is treated as a separate instance of the report.
* getReportResults: Contains the results of running a report.

For example, the following producer endpoint uses the createBatch API to
create a Job Batch. The in message must contain a body that can be converted into an
`InputStream` (usually UTF-8 CSV or XML content from a file, etc.) and
header fields 'jobId' for the Job and 'contentType' for the Job content
type, which can be XML, CSV, ZIP_XML or ZIP_CSV. The put message body
will contain `BatchInfo` on success, or throw a `SalesforceException` on
error.

[source,java]
----
...to("salesforce:createBatchJob")..
----

=== Rest Streaming API

Consumer endpoints can use the following syntax for streaming endpoints
to receive Salesforce notifications on create/update.

To create and subscribe to a topic

[source,java]
----
from("salesforce:CamelTestTopic?notifyForFields=ALL&notifyForOperations=ALL&sObjectName=Merchandise__c&updateTopic=true&sObjectQuery=SELECT Id, Name FROM Merchandise__c")...
----

To subscribe to an existing topic

[source,java]
----
from("salesforce:CamelTestTopic&sObjectName=Merchandise__c")...
----

=== Platform events

To emit a platform event use `createSObject` operation. And set the
message body can be JSON string or InputStream with key-value data --
in that case `sObjectName` needs to be set to the API name of the
event, or a class that extends from AbstractDTOBase with the
appropriate class name for the event.

For example using a DTO:

[source,java]
----
class Order_Event__e extends AbstractDTOBase {
  @JsonProperty("OrderNumber")
  private String orderNumber;
  // ... other properties and getters/setters
}

from("timer:tick")
    .process(exchange -> {
        final Message in = exchange.getIn();
        String orderNumber = "ORD" + String.valueOf(in.getHeader(Exchange.TIMER_COUNTER));
        Order_Event__e event = new Order_Event__e();
        event.setOrderNumber(orderNumber);
        in.setBody(event);
    })
    .to("salesforce:createSObject");
----

Or using JSON event data:

[source,java]
----
from("timer:tick")
    .process(exchange -> {
        final Message in = exchange.getIn();
        String orderNumber = "ORD" + String.valueOf(in.getHeader(Exchange.TIMER_COUNTER));
        in.setBody("{\"OrderNumber\":\"" + orderNumber + "\"}");
    })
    .to("salesforce:createSObject?sObjectName=Order_Event__e");
----

To receive platform events use the consumer endpoint with the API name of
the platform event prefixed with `event/` (or `/event/`), e.g.:
`salesforce:events/Order_Event__e`. Processor consuming from that
endpoint will receive either `org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.PlatformEvent`
object or `org.cometd.bayeux.Message` in the body depending on the
`rawPayload` being `false` or `true` respectively.

For example, in the simplest form to consume one event:

[source,java]
----
PlatformEvent event = consumer.receiveBody("salesforce:event/Order_Event__e", PlatformEvent.class);
----

=== Change data capture events

On the one hand, Salesforce could be configured to emit notifications for record changes of select objects.
On the other hand, the Camel Salesforce component could react to such notifications, allowing for instance to
https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/change-data-capture/understand-change-data-capture[synchronize those changes into an external system].

The notifications of interest could be specified in the `from("salesforce:XXX")` clause of a Camel route via the subscription channel, e.g:

[source,java]
----
from("salesforce:data/ChangeEvents?replayId=-1").log("being notified of all change events")
from("salesforce:data/AccountChangeEvent?replayId=-1").log("being notified of change events for Account records")
from("salesforce:data/Employee__ChangeEvent?replayId=-1").log("being notified of change events for Employee__c custom object")
----

The received message contains either `java.util.Map<String,Object>` or `org.cometd.bayeux.Message` in the body depending on the `rawPayload` being `false` or `true` respectively. The `CamelSalesforceChangeType` header could be valued to one of `CREATE`, `UPDATE`,  `DELETE` or `UNDELETE`.

More details about how to use the Camel Salesforce component change data capture capabilities could be found in the https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components/camel-salesforce/camel-salesforce-component/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/salesforce/ChangeEventsConsumerIntegrationTest.java[ChangeEventsConsumerIntegrationTest].

The https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.change_data_capture.meta/change_data_capture/cdc_intro.htm[Salesforce developer guide]
is a good fit to better know the subtleties of implementing a change data capture integration application.
The dynamic nature of change event body fields, high level replication steps as well as security considerations could be of interest.

== Examples

=== Uploading a document to a ContentWorkspace

Create the ContentVersion in Java, using a Processor instance:

[source,java]
----
public class ContentProcessor implements Processor {
    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
        Message message = exchange.getIn();

        ContentVersion cv = new ContentVersion();
        ContentWorkspace cw = getWorkspace(exchange);
        cv.setFirstPublishLocationId(cw.getId());
        cv.setTitle("test document");
        cv.setPathOnClient("test_doc.html");
        byte[] document = message.getBody(byte[].class);
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        String enc = mapper.convertValue(document, String.class);
        cv.setVersionDataUrl(enc);
        message.setBody(cv);
    }

    protected ContentWorkspace getWorkSpace(Exchange exchange) {
        // Look up the content workspace somehow, maybe use enrich() to add it to a
        // header that can be extracted here
        ....
    }
} 
----

Give the output from the processor to the Salesforce component:

[source,java]
----
from("file:///home/camel/library")
    .to(new ContentProcessor())     // convert bytes from the file into a ContentVersion SObject 
                                    // for the salesforce component
    .to("salesforce:createSObject"); 
----

== Using Salesforce Limits API

With `salesforce:limits` operation you can fetch of API limits from Salesforce and then act upon that data received.
The result of `salesforce:limits` operation is mapped to `org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.Limits`
class and can be used in a custom processors or expressions.

For instance, consider that you need to limit the API usage of Salesforce so that 10% of daily API requests is left for
other routes. The body of output message contains an instance of
`org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.Limits` object that can be used in conjunction with
Content Based Router and Content Based Router and 
xref:languages:spel-language.adoc[Spring Expression Language (SpEL)] to choose when to perform queries.

Notice how multiplying `1.0` with the integer value held in `body.dailyApiRequests.remaining` makes the expression
evaluate as with floating point arithmetic, without it - it would end up making integral division which would result
with either `0` (some API limits consumed) or `1` (no API limits consumed).

[source,java]
----
from("direct:querySalesforce")
    .to("salesforce:limits")
    .choice()
    .when(spel("#{1.0 * body.dailyApiRequests.remaining / body.dailyApiRequests.max < 0.1}"))
        .to("salesforce:query?...")
    .otherwise()
        .setBody(constant("Used up Salesforce API limits, leaving 10% for critical routes"))
    .endChoice()
----

== Working with approvals

All the properties are named exactly the same as in the Salesforce REST API prefixed with `approval.`. You can set
approval properties by setting `approval.PropertyName` of the Endpoint these will be used as template -- meaning
that any property not present in either body or header will be taken from the Endpoint configuration. Or you can set
the approval template on the Endpoint by assigning `approval` property to a reference onto a bean in the Registry.

You can also provide header values using the same `approval.PropertyName` in the incoming message headers.

And finally body can contain one `AprovalRequest` or an `Iterable` of `ApprovalRequest` objects to process as
a batch.

The important thing to remember is the priority of the values specified in these three mechanisms:

. value in body takes precedence before any other
. value in message header takes precedence before template value
. value in template is set if no other value in header or body was given

For example to send one record for approval using values in headers use:

Given a route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:example1")//
        .setHeader("approval.ContextId", simple("${body['contextId']}"))
        .setHeader("approval.NextApproverIds", simple("${body['nextApproverIds']}"))
        .to("salesforce:approval?"//
            + "approval.actionType=Submit"//
            + "&approval.comments=this is a test"//
            + "&approval.processDefinitionNameOrId=Test_Account_Process"//
            + "&approval.skipEntryCriteria=true");
----

You could send a record for approval using:

[source,java]
----
final Map<String, String> body = new HashMap<>();
body.put("contextId", accountIds.iterator().next());
body.put("nextApproverIds", userId);

final ApprovalResult result = template.requestBody("direct:example1", body, ApprovalResult.class);
----

== Using Salesforce Recent Items API

To fetch the recent items use `salesforce:recent` operation. This operation returns an `java.util.List` of
`org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.RecentItem` objects (`List<RecentItem>`) that in turn contain
the `Id`, `Name` and `Attributes` (with `type` and `url` properties). You can limit the number of returned items
by specifying `limit` parameter set to maximum number of records to return. For example:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:fetchRecentItems")
    to("salesforce:recent")
        .split().body()
            .log("${body.name} at ${body.attributes.url}");
----

== Using Salesforce Composite API to submit SObject tree

To create up to 200 records including parent-child relationships use `salesforce:composite-tree` operation. This
requires an instance of `org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.composite.SObjectTree` in the input 
message and returns the same tree of objects in the output message. The 
`org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.AbstractSObjectBase` instances within the tree get updated with
the identifier values (`Id` property) or their corresponding
`org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.dto.composite.SObjectNode` is populated with `errors` on failure.

Note that for some records operation can succeed and for some it can fail -- so you need to manually check for errors.

Easiest way to use this functionality is to use the DTOs generated by the `camel-salesforce-maven-plugin`, but you
also have the option of customizing the references that identify the each object in the tree, for instance primary keys
from your database.

Lets look at an example:

[source,java]
----
Account account = ...
Contact president = ...
Contact marketing = ...

Account anotherAccount = ...
Contact sales = ...
Asset someAsset = ...

// build the tree
SObjectTree request = new SObjectTree();
request.addObject(account).addChildren(president, marketing);
request.addObject(anotherAccount).addChild(sales).addChild(someAsset);

final SObjectTree response = template.requestBody("salesforce:composite-tree", tree, SObjectTree.class);
final Map<Boolean, List<SObjectNode>> result = response.allNodes()
                                                   .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(SObjectNode::hasErrors));

final List<SObjectNode> withErrors = result.get(true);
final List<SObjectNode> succeeded = result.get(false);

final String firstId = succeeded.get(0).getId();
----

== Using Salesforce Composite API to submit multiple requests in a batch
The Composite API batch operation (`composite-batch`) allows you to accumulate multiple requests in a batch and then
submit them in one go, saving the round trip cost of multiple individual requests. Each response is then received in a
list of responses with the order preserved, so that the n-th requests response is in the n-th place of the response.

[NOTE]
====
The results can vary from API to API so the result of the request is given as a `java.lang.Object`. In most cases
the result will be a `java.util.Map` with string keys and values or other `java.util.Map` as value. Requests made in
JSON format hold some type information (i.e. it is known what values are strings and what values are numbers), so in
general those will be more type friendly. Note that the responses will vary between XML and JSON, this is due to the
responses from Salesforce API being different. So be careful if you switch between formats without changing the response
handling code.
====

Lets look at an example:

[source,java]
----
final String acountId = ...
final SObjectBatch batch = new SObjectBatch("38.0");

final Account updates = new Account();
updates.setName("NewName");
batch.addUpdate("Account", accountId, updates);

final Account newAccount = new Account();
newAccount.setName("Account created from Composite batch API");
batch.addCreate(newAccount);

batch.addGet("Account", accountId, "Name", "BillingPostalCode");

batch.addDelete("Account", accountId);

final SObjectBatchResponse response = template.requestBody("salesforce:composite-batch?format=JSON", batch, SObjectBatchResponse.class);

boolean hasErrors = response.hasErrors(); // if any of the requests has resulted in either 4xx or 5xx HTTP status
final List<SObjectBatchResult> results = response.getResults(); // results of three operations sent in batch

final SObjectBatchResult updateResult = results.get(0); // update result
final int updateStatus = updateResult.getStatusCode(); // probably 204
final Object updateResultData = updateResult.getResult(); // probably null

final SObjectBatchResult createResult = results.get(1); // create result
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
final Map<String, Object> createData = (Map<String, Object>) createResult.getResult();
final String newAccountId = createData.get("id"); // id of the new account, this is for JSON, for XML it would be createData.get("Result").get("id")

final SObjectBatchResult retrieveResult = results.get(2); // retrieve result
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
final Map<String, Object> retrieveData = (Map<String, Object>) retrieveResult.getResult();
final String accountName = retrieveData.get("Name"); // Name of the retrieved account, this is for JSON, for XML it would be createData.get("Account").get("Name")
final String accountBillingPostalCode = retrieveData.get("BillingPostalCode"); // Name of the retrieved account, this is for JSON, for XML it would be createData.get("Account").get("BillingPostalCode")

final SObjectBatchResult deleteResult = results.get(3); // delete result
final int updateStatus = deleteResult.getStatusCode(); // probably 204
final Object updateResultData = deleteResult.getResult(); // probably null
----

== Using Salesforce Composite API to submit multiple chained requests
The `composite` operation allows submitting up to 25 requests that can be chained together, for instance identifier
generated in previous request can be used in subsequent request. Individual requests and responses are linked with the
provided _reference_.

[NOTE]
====
Composite API supports only JSON payloads.
====

[NOTE]
====
As with the batch API the results can vary from API to API so the result of the request is given as a
`java.lang.Object`. In most cases the result will be a `java.util.Map` with string keys and values or other
`java.util.Map` as value. Requests made in JSON format hold some type information (i.e. it is known what values are
strings and what values are numbers), so in general those will be more type friendly.
====

Lets look at an example:

[source,java]
----
SObjectComposite composite = new SObjectComposite("38.0", true);

// first insert operation via an external id
final Account updateAccount = new TestAccount();
updateAccount.setName("Salesforce");
updateAccount.setBillingStreet("Landmark @ 1 Market Street");
updateAccount.setBillingCity("San Francisco");
updateAccount.setBillingState("California");
updateAccount.setIndustry(Account_IndustryEnum.TECHNOLOGY);
composite.addUpdate("Account", "001xx000003DIpcAAG", updateAccount, "UpdatedAccount");

final Contact newContact = new TestContact();
newContact.setLastName("John Doe");
newContact.setPhone("1234567890");
composite.addCreate(newContact, "NewContact");

final AccountContactJunction__c junction = new AccountContactJunction__c();
junction.setAccount__c("001xx000003DIpcAAG");
junction.setContactId__c("@{NewContact.id}");
composite.addCreate(junction, "JunctionRecord");

final SObjectCompositeResponse response = template.requestBody("salesforce:composite?format=JSON", composite, SObjectCompositeResponse.class);
final List<SObjectCompositeResult> results = response.getCompositeResponse();

final SObjectCompositeResult accountUpdateResult = results.stream().filter(r -> "UpdatedAccount".equals(r.getReferenceId())).findFirst().get()
final int statusCode = accountUpdateResult.getHttpStatusCode(); // should be 200
final Map<String, ?> accountUpdateBody = accountUpdateResult.getBody();

final SObjectCompositeResult contactCreationResult = results.stream().filter(r -> "JunctionRecord".equals(r.getReferenceId())).findFirst().get()
----

==  Sending null values to salesforce

By default, SObject fields with null values are not sent to salesforce. In order to
send null values to salesforce, use the `fieldsToNull` property, as follows:

[source,java]
----
accountSObject.getFieldsToNull().add("Site");
----

== Generating SOQL query strings

`org.apache.camel.component.salesforce.api.utils.QueryHelper` contains helper
methods to generate SOQL queries. For instance to fetch all custom fields from
_Account_ SObject you can simply generate the SOQL SELECT by invoking:

[source,java]
----
String allCustomFieldsQuery = QueryHelper.queryToFetchFilteredFieldsOf(new Account(), SObjectField::isCustom);
----

== Camel Salesforce Maven Plugin

This Maven plugin generates DTOs for the Camel. 

For obvious security reasons it is recommended that the clientId,
clientSecret, userName and password fields be not set in the pom.xml.  
The plugin should be configured for the rest of the properties, and can
be executed using the following command:

[source,java]
----
mvn camel-salesforce:generate -DcamelSalesforce.clientId=<clientid> -DcamelSalesforce.clientSecret=<clientsecret> \
    -DcamelSalesforce.userName=<username> -DcamelSalesforce.password=<password>
----

The generated DTOs use Jackson and XStream annotations. All Salesforce
field types are supported. Date and time fields are mapped to
`java.time.ZonedDateTime` by default, and picklist fields are mapped to
generated Java Enumerations.

Please refer to
https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components/camel-salesforce/camel-salesforce-maven-plugin[README.md]
for details on how to generate the DTO.

| *loginUrl* (security) | *Required* URL of the Salesforce instance used for authentication, by default set to \https://login.salesforce.com | https://login.salesforce.com | String
| *password* (security) | Password used in OAuth flow to gain access to access token. It's easy to get started with password OAuth flow, but in general one should avoid it as it is deemed less secure than other flows. Make sure that you append security token to the end of the password if using one. |  | String
| *refreshToken* (security) | Refresh token already obtained in the refresh token OAuth flow. One needs to setup a web application and configure a callback URL to receive the refresh token, or configure using the builtin callback at \https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success or \https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/success and then retrive the refresh_token from the URL at the end of the flow. Note that in development organizations Salesforce allows hosting the callback web application at localhost. |  | String
