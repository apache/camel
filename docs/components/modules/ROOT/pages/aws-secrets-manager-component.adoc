*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The AWS Secrets Manager component supports list secret
https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be
signed up to use Amazon Secrets Manager. More information is available at
https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager].


== URI Format

-------------------------
aws-secrets-manager://label[?options]
-------------------------

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...


// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The AWS Secrets Manager component supports 17 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *binaryPayload* (producer) | Set if the secret is binary or not | false | boolean
| *configuration* (producer) | Component configuration |  | SecretsManagerConfiguration
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | *Required* The operation to perform. There are 8 enums and the value can be one of: listSecrets, createSecret, getSecret, describeSecret, deleteSecret, rotateSecret, updateSecret, replicateSecretToRegions |  | SecretsManagerOperations
| *overrideEndpoint* (producer) | Set the need for overidding the endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with uriEndpointOverride option | false | boolean
| *pojoRequest* (producer) | If we want to use a POJO request as body or not | false | boolean
| *proxyHost* (producer) | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Secrets Manager client |  | String
| *proxyPort* (producer) | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Secrets Manager client |  | Integer
| *proxyProtocol* (producer) | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Secrets Manager client. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: HTTP, HTTPS | HTTPS | Protocol
| *region* (producer) | The region in which Secrets Manager client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() |  | String
| *secretsManagerClient* (producer) | *Autowired* To use a existing configured AWS Secrets Manager as client |  | SecretsManagerClient
| *trustAllCertificates* (producer) | If we want to trust all certificates in case of overriding the endpoint | false | boolean
| *uriEndpointOverride* (producer) | Set the overriding uri endpoint. This option needs to be used in combination with overrideEndpoint option |  | String
| *useDefaultCredentialsProvider* (producer) | Set whether the Translate client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *accessKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Access Key |  | String
| *secretKey* (security) | Amazon AWS Secret Key |  | String

== Endpoint Options

The AWS Secrets Manager endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
aws-secrets-manager://label

with the following path and query parameters:

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*
