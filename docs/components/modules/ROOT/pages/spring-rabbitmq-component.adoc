*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Spring RabbitMQ component allows you to produce and consume messages from
http://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] instances. Using the Spring RabbitMQ
client.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring-rabbitmq</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

== URI format

[source,text]
----
spring-rabbitmq:exchangeName?[options]
----

The exchange name determines the exchange to which the produced 
messages will be sent to. In the case of consumers, the exchange name 
determines the exchange the queue will be bound to.

== Options

// component options: START
The Spring RabbitMQ component supports 20 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *amqpAdmin* (common) | *Autowired* Optional AMQP Admin service to use for auto declaring elements (queues, exchanges, bindings) |  | AmqpAdmin
| *connectionFactory* (common) | *Autowired* The connection factory to be use. A connection factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint. |  | ConnectionFactory
| *testConnectionOnStartup* (common) | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup. This ensures that when Camel starts that all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. If a connection cannot be granted then Camel throws an exception on startup. This ensures that Camel is not started with failed connections. The JMS producers is tested as well. | false | boolean
| *autoDeclare* (consumer) | Specifies whether the consumer should auto declare binding between exchange, queue and routing key when starting. Enabling this can be good for development to make it easy to standup exchanges, queues and bindings on the broker. | false | boolean
| *autoStartup* (consumer) | Specifies whether the consumer container should auto-startup. | true | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *deadLetterExchange* (consumer) | The name of the dead letter exchange |  | String
| *deadLetterExchangeType* (consumer) | The type of the dead letter exchange. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of: direct, fanout, headers, topic | direct | String
| *deadLetterQueue* (consumer) | The name of the dead letter queue |  | String
| *deadLetterRoutingKey* (consumer) | The routing key for the dead letter exchange |  | String
| *errorHandler* (consumer) | To use a custom ErrorHandler for handling exceptions from the message listener (consumer) |  | ErrorHandler
| *listenerContainerFactory* (consumer) | To use a custom factory for creating and configuring ListenerContainer to be used by the consumer for receiving messages |  | ListenerContainerFactory
| *prefetchCount* (consumer) | Tell the broker how many messages to send to each consumer in a single request. Often this can be set quite high to improve throughput. | 250 | int
| *shutdownTimeout* (consumer) | The time to wait for workers in milliseconds after the container is stopped. If any workers are active when the shutdown signal comes they will be allowed to finish processing as long as they can finish within this timeout. | 5000 | long
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
| *ignoreDeclarationExceptions* (advanced) | Switch on ignore exceptions such as mismatched properties when declaring | false | boolean
| *messageConverter* (advanced) | To use a custom MessageConverter so you can be in control how to map to/from a org.springframework.amqp.core.Message. |  | MessageConverter
| *messagePropertiesConverter* (advanced) | To use a custom MessagePropertiesConverter so you can be in control how to map to/from a org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageProperties. |  | MessagePropertiesConverter
| *headerFilterStrategy* (filter) | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message. |  | HeaderFilterStrategy

// component options: END


// endpoint options: START
The Spring RabbitMQ endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
spring-rabbitmq:exchangeName
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *exchangeName* | *Required* The exchange name determines the exchange to which the produced messages will be sent to. In the case of consumers, the exchange name determines the exchange the queue will be bound to. Note: to use default exchange then do not use empty name, but use default instead. |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (26 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *connectionFactory* (common) | The connection factory to be use. A connection factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint. |  | ConnectionFactory
| *disableReplyTo* (common) | Specifies whether Camel ignores the ReplyTo header in messages. If true, Camel does not send a reply back to the destination specified in the ReplyTo header. You can use this option if you want Camel to consume from a route and you do not want Camel to automatically send back a reply message because another component in your code handles the reply message. You can also use this option if you want to use Camel as a proxy between different message brokers and you want to route message from one system to another. | false | boolean
| *routingKey* (common) | The value of a routing key to use. Default is empty which is not helpful when using the default (or any direct) exchange, but fine if the exchange is a headers exchange for instance. |  | String
| *testConnectionOnStartup* (common) | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup. This ensures that when Camel starts that all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. If a connection cannot be granted then Camel throws an exception on startup. This ensures that Camel is not started with failed connections. The JMS producers is tested as well. | false | boolean
| *acknowledgeMode* (consumer) | Flag controlling the behaviour of the container with respect to message acknowledgement. The most common usage is to let the container handle the acknowledgements (so the listener doesn't need to know about the channel or the message). Set to AcknowledgeMode.MANUAL if the listener will send the acknowledgements itself using Channel.basicAck(long, boolean). Manual acks are consistent with either a transactional or non-transactional channel, but if you are doing no other work on the channel at the same other than receiving a single message then the transaction is probably unnecessary. Set to AcknowledgeMode.NONE to tell the broker not to expect any acknowledgements, and it will assume all messages are acknowledged as soon as they are sent (this is autoack in native Rabbit broker terms). If AcknowledgeMode.NONE then the channel cannot be transactional (so the container will fail on start up if that flag is accidentally set). There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: NONE, MANUAL, AUTO |  | AcknowledgeMode
| *asyncConsumer* (consumer) | Whether the consumer processes the Exchange asynchronously. If enabled then the consumer may pickup the next message from the queue, while the previous message is being processed asynchronously (by the Asynchronous Routing Engine). This means that messages may be processed not 100% strictly in order. If disabled (as default) then the Exchange is fully processed before the consumer will pickup the next message from the queue. | false | boolean
| *autoDeclare* (consumer) | Specifies whether the consumer should auto declare binding between exchange, queue and routing key when starting. | true | boolean
| *autoStartup* (consumer) | Specifies whether the consumer container should auto-startup. | true | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *deadLetterExchange* (consumer) | The name of the dead letter exchange |  | String
| *deadLetterExchangeType* (consumer) | The type of the dead letter exchange. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of: direct, fanout, headers, topic | direct | String
| *deadLetterQueue* (consumer) | The name of the dead letter queue |  | String
| *deadLetterRoutingKey* (consumer) | The routing key for the dead letter exchange |  | String
| *exchangeType* (consumer) | The type of the exchange. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of: direct, fanout, headers, topic | direct | String
| *exclusive* (consumer) | Set to true for an exclusive consumer | false | boolean
| *noLocal* (consumer) | Set to true for an no-local consumer | false | boolean
| *queues* (consumer) | The queue(s) to use for consuming messages. Multiple queue names can be separated by comma. If none has been configured then Camel will generate an unique id as the queue name for the consumer. |  | String
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *replyTimeout* (producer) | Specify the timeout in milliseconds to be used when waiting for a reply message when doing request/reply messaging. The default value is 5 seconds. A negative value indicates an indefinite timeout. | 5000 | long
| *usePublisherConnection* (producer) | Use a separate connection for publishers and consumers | false | boolean
| *args* (advanced) | Specify arguments for configuring the different RabbitMQ concepts, a different prefix is required for each element: arg.consumer. arg.exchange. arg.queue. arg.binding. arg.dlq.exchange. arg.dlq.queue. arg.dlq.binding. For example to declare a queue with message ttl argument: args=arg.queue.x-message-ttl=60000 |  | Map
| *messageConverter* (advanced) | To use a custom MessageConverter so you can be in control how to map to/from a org.springframework.amqp.core.Message. |  | MessageConverter
| *messagePropertiesConverter* (advanced) | To use a custom MessagePropertiesConverter so you can be in control how to map to/from a org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageProperties. |  | MessagePropertiesConverter
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used | false | boolean
|===
// endpoint options: END

== Using a connection factory

To connect to RabbitMQ you need to setup a `ConnectionFactory` (same as with JMS) with the login details such as:

TIP: It is recommended to use `CachingConnectionFactory` from spring-rabbit as it comes with connection pooling out of the box.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="rabbitConnectionFactory" class="org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.CachingConnectionFactory">
  <property name="uri" value="amqp://lolcalhost:5672"/>
</bean>
----

The `ConnectionFactory` is auto-detected by default, so you can just do

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:cheese"/>
    <to uri="spring-rabbitmq:foo?routingKey=cheese"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

== Default Exchange Name

To use default exchange name (which would be an empty exchange name in RabbitMQ) then you should use `default` as name
in the endpoint uri, such as:

[source,java]
----
to("spring-rabbitmq:default?routingKey=foo")
----

== Auto declare exchanges, queues and bindings

Before you can send or receive messages from RabbitMQ, then exchanges, queues and bindings must be setup first.

In development mode it may be desirable to let Camel automatic do this.
You can enable this by setting `autoDeclare=true` on the `SpringRabbitMQComponent`.

Then Spring RabbitMQ will automatic necessary declare the elements and setup the binding between the exchange, queue and routing keys.

The elements can be configured using the multi-valued `args` option.

For example to specify the queue as durable and exclusive, you can configure the endpoint uri with `arg.queue.durable=true&arg.queue.exclusive=true`.

*Exchanges*

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,70%,10%",options="header",]
|=====================================================================
|Option |Type |Description|Default
| autoDelete | boolean | True if the server should delete the exchange when it is no longer in use (if all bindings are deleted). | false
| durable | boolean | A durable exchange will survive a server restart. | true
|=====================================================================

You can also configure any additional `x-` arguments.
See details in the RabbitMQ documentation.


*Queues*

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,70%,10%",options="header",]
|=====================================================================
|Option |Type |Description|Default
| autoDelete | boolean | True if the server should delete the exchange when it is no longer in use (if all bindings are deleted). | false
| durable | boolean | A durable queue will survive a server restart. | false
| exclusive | boolean | Whether the queue is exclusive | false
| x-dead-letter-exchange | String | The name of the dead letter exchange. If none configured then the component configured value is used. |
| x-dead-letter-routing-key | String | The routing key for the dead letter exchange. If none configured then the component configured value is used. |
|=====================================================================

You can also configure any additional `x-` arguments, such as the message time to live, via `x-message-ttl`, and many others.
See details in the RabbitMQ documentation.

== Mapping from Camel to RabbitMQ

The message body is mapped from Camel Message body to a `byte[]` which is the type that RabbitMQ uses for message body.
Camel wil use its type converter to convert the message body to byte array.

Spring Rabbit comes out of the box with support for mapping Java serialized objects but Camel Spring RabbitMQ
does *not* support this due to security vulnerabilities and using Java objects is a bad design as it enforces strong coupling.

Custom message headers is mapped from Camel Message headers to RabbitMQ headers. This behaviour can be customized by configuring
a new implementation of `HeaderFilterStrategy` on the Camel component.

== Request / Reply

Request and reply messaging is supported using https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html[RabbitMQ direct reply-to].

The example below will do request/reply, where the message is sent via the cheese exchange name and routing key _foo.bar_,
which is being consumed by the 2nd Camel route, that prepends the message with `Hello `, and then sends back the message.

So if we send `World` as message body to _direct:start_ then, we will se the message being logged

- log:request => World
- log:input => World
- log:response => Hello World

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("log:request")
    .to(ExchangePattern.InOut, "spring-rabbitmq:cheese?routingKey=foo.bar")
    .to("log:response");

from("spring-rabbitmq:cheese?queues=myqueue&routingKey=foo.bar")
    .to("log:input")
    .transform(body().prepend("Hello "));
----

== Reuse endpoint and send to different destinations computed at runtime

If you need to send messages to a lot of different RabbitMQ exchanges, it
makes sense to reuse a endpoint and specify the real destination in
a message header. This allows Camel to reuse the same endpoint, but send
to different exchanges. This greatly reduces the number of endpoints
created and economizes on memory and thread resources.

TIP: Using xref:{eip-vc}:eips:toD-eip.adoc[toD] is easier than specifying the dynamic destination with headers

You can specify using the following headers:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=====================================================================
|Header |Type |Description
|`CamelSpringRabbitmqExchangeOverrideName` |`String` |The exchange name.
|`CamelSpringRabbitmqRoutingOverrideKey` |`String` |The routing key.
|=====================================================================

For example, the following route shows how you can compute a destination
at run time and use it to override the exchange appearing in the endpoint
URL:

[source,java]
----
from("file://inbox")
  .to("bean:computeDestination")
  .to("spring-rabbitmq:dummy");
----

The exchange name, `dummy`, is just a placeholder. It must be provided as
part of the RabbitMQ endpoint URL, but it will be ignored in this example.

In the `computeDestination` bean, specify the real destination by
setting the `CamelRabbitmqExchangeOverrideName` header as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void setExchangeHeader(Exchange exchange) {
   String region = ....
   exchange.getIn().setHeader("CamelSpringRabbitmqExchangeOverrideName", "order-" + region);
}
----

Then Camel will read this header and use it as the exchange name instead
of the one configured on the endpoint. So, in this example Camel sends
the message to `spring-rabbitmq:order-emea`, assuming the `region` value was `emea`.

Keep in mind that the producer removes both `CamelSpringRabbitmqExchangeOverrideName` and `CamelSpringRabbitmqRoutingOverrideKey`
headers from the exchange and do not propagate them to the created Rabbitmq
message in order to avoid the accidental loops
in the routes (in scenarios when the message will be forwarded to the
another RabbitMQ endpoint).

== Using toD

If you need to send messages to a lot of different exchanges, it
makes sense to reuse a endpoint and specify the dynamic destinations
with simple language using xref:{eip-vc}:eips:toD-eip.adoc[toD].

For example suppose you need to send messages to exchanges with order types,
then using toD could for example be done as follows:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:order")
  .toD("spring-rabbit:order-${header.orderType}");
----
