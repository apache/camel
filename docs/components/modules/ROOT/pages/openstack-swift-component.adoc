*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Openstack Swift component allows messages to be sent to an OpenStack object storage services.

== Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-openstack</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel.


== URI Format

----------------------------
openstack-swift://hosturl[?options]
----------------------------

// component-configure options: START
== Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

=== Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:latest@manual::component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL],
in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

=== Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to
configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from)
or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:latest@manual::Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:latest@manual::using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.
// component-configure options: END

// component options: START
== Component Options


The OpenStack Swift component supports 2 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean
|===
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START
== Endpoint Options

The OpenStack Swift endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
openstack-swift:host
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *host* | *Required* OpenStack host url |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (9 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *apiVersion* (producer) | OpenStack API version. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: V2, V3 | V3 | String
| *config* (producer) | OpenStack configuration |  | Config
| *domain* (producer) | Authentication domain | default | String
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | The operation to do |  | String
| *password* (producer) | *Required* OpenStack password |  | String
| *project* (producer) | *Required* The project ID |  | String
| *subsystem* (producer) | *Required* OpenStack Swift subsystem. There are 2 enums and the value can be one of: objects, containers |  | String
| *username* (producer) | *Required* OpenStack username |  | String
|===
// endpoint options: END


== Usage

You can use following settings for each subsystem:

== containers

=== Operations you can perform with the Container producer
[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|=========================================================================
|Operation | Description

|`create` | Create new container.

|`get` | Get the container.

|`getAll` | Get all containers.

|`update` | Update the container.

|`delete` | Delete the container.

|`getMetadata` | Get metadata.

|`createUpdateMetadata` | Create/update metadata.

|`deleteMetadata` | Delete metadata.
|=========================================================================

=== Message headers evaluated by the Volume producer

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,70%",options="header",]
|=========================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

|`operation` | `String` | The operation to perform.

|`name` |`String` |The container name.

|`X-Container-Meta-` |`Map` | Container metadata prefix.

|`X-Versions-Location` |`String` | Versions location.

|`X-Container-Read` |`String` |  ACL - container read.

|`X-Container-Write` |`String` | ACL - container write.

|=========================================================================

If you need more precise container settings you can create new object of the type *org.openstack4j.model.storage.object.options.CreateUpdateContainerOptions* (in case of create or update operation) 
or *org.openstack4j.model.storage.object.options.ContainerListOptions* for listing containers and send in the message body.
