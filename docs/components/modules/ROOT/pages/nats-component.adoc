*Since Camel 2.17*

// HEADER END

http://nats.io/[NATS] is a fast and reliable messaging platform.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to
their `pom.xml` for this component.

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-nats</artifactId>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
------------------------------------------------------------

== URI format

[source,java]
----------------------
nats:servers[?options]
----------------------

Where *servers* represents the list of NATS servers.

== Options


// component options: START
The Nats component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *servers* (common) | URLs to one or more NAT servers. Use comma to separate URLs when specifying multiple servers. |  | String
| *useGlobalSslContext Parameters* (security) | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | boolean
| *basicPropertyBinding* (advanced) | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
|===

// endpoint options: START
The Nats endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
nats:topic
----

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *topic* | *Required* The name of topic we want to use |  | String
|===


=== Query Parameters (28 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===

| *servers* (common) | URLs to one or more NAT servers. Use comma to separate URLs when specifying multiple servers. |  | String
| *verbose* (common) | Whether or not running in verbose mode | false | boolean
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *maxMessages* (consumer) | Stop receiving messages from a topic we are subscribing to after maxMessages |  | String
| *poolSize* (consumer) | Consumer thread pool size (default is 10) | 10 | int
| *queueName* (consumer) | The Queue name if we are using nats for a queue configuration |  | String
| *replyToDisabled* (consumer) | Can be used to turn off sending back reply message in the consumer. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.

== Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-nats-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
----


The component supports 5 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *camel.component.nats.basic-property-binding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.nats.bridge-error-handler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean
| *camel.component.nats.enabled* | Whether to enable auto configuration of the nats component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean
| *camel.component.nats.lazy-start-producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.

Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean

== Headers

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description
| CamelNatsSID | String | The SID of a consumed message.
| CamelNatsReplyTo | String | The ReplyTo of a consumed message (may be null).
| CamelNatsSubject | String | The Subject of a consumed message.
| CamelNatsQueueName | String | The Queue name of a consumed message (may be null).
| CamelNatsMessageTimestamp | long | The timestamp of a consumed message.
|=======================================================================

== Request/Reply support
The producer only supports publishing (sending) messages.
The producer does not support request/reply where it can wait for an expected reply message.

The consumer will when routing the message is complete, send back the message as reply-message if required.

== Examples

*Producer example:*

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:send").to("nats://localhost:4222?topic=test");
-----------------------------------------------------------

In case of using Authorization you can directly specify your credentials in the server URL

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:send").to("nats://username:password@localhost:4222?topic=test");
-----------------------------------------------------------

or your token

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
from("direct:send").to("nats://token@localhost:4222?topic=test");
-----------------------------------------------------------

*Consumer example:*

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("nats://localhost:4222?topic=test&maxMessages=5&queueName=test").to("mock:result");
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
