= How does Camel work with ActiveMQ?

You can use Camel to do smart routing and implement the
xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] inside:

* the ActiveMQ message broker
* the ActiveMQ JMS client

So Camel can route messages to and from xref:components::mail-component.adoc[Mail],
xref:components::file-component.adoc[File], xref:components::ftp-component.adoc[FTP], xref:components::jpa-component.adoc[JPA],
xref:components::xmpp-component.adoc[XMPP] other xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] providers and any of the
other Camel xref:component.adoc[Components] as well as implementating
all of the xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] such as xref:{eip-vc}:eips:content-based-router-eip.adoc[Content
Based Router] or xref:{eip-vc}:eips:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator].
