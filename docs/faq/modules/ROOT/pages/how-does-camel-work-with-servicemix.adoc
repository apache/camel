= How does Camel work with ServiceMix?

You can use Camel to do smart routing and implement the
xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] inside of the JBI container, routing between existing JBI
components together with communicating with any of the other Camel
xref:component.adoc[Components].

To do this you take your Camel xref:components::spring.adoc[Spring] configuration
and turn it into a JBI Service Unit using the maven plugin or archetype.

Camel plugin].
