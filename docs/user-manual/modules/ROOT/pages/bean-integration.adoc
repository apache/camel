= Bean Integration

Camel supports the integration of beans and POJOs in a number of ways.

== Annotations

If a bean is defined in Spring XML or scanned using
the Spring component scanning mechanism, and a *<camelContext>* is used
or a `CamelBeanPostProcessor` then we process a number of Camel
annotations to do various things such as injecting resources or
producing, consuming or routing messages.

The following annotations is supported and inject by Camel's
`CamelBeanPostProcessor`

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Annotation |Description
|`@EndpointInject` |To inject an endpoint, see more details at xref:pojo-producing.adoc[POJO Producing].
|`@BeanInject` |To inject a bean obtained from the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]. See xref:bean-injection.adoc[Bean Injection].
|`@BeanConfigInject` |To inject a configuration bean obtained from the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]. The bean is a POJO that represents
a set of configuration options, which is automatic configured with values loaded via Camel xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders].
|`@PropertyInject` |To inject a value using property placeholder.
|`@Produce` |To inject a producer to send message to an endpoint. See xref:pojo-producing.adoc[POJO Producing].
|`@Consume` |To inject a consumer on a method. See xref:pojo-consuming.adoc[POJO Consuming].
|`@BindToRegistry` |Used for binding a bean to the registry.
  If no name is specified then the bean will have its name auto computed based on the class name,
 field name, or method name where the annotation is configured.
|`@DeferredContextBinding` | Used to indicate that if the target type is `CamelContextAware` then the `CamelContext` is deferred and injected later; after the bootstrap of Camel so the `CamelContext` is ready for use.

  the behaviour of method invocations with Spring Remoting or POJO Producing

*Example*

See the https://github.com/apache/camel-examples/tree/main/examples/pojo-messaging[POJO Messaging Example]
for how to use the annotations for routing and messaging.

== Using @PropertyInject

Camel allows injecting property placeholders in POJOs using
the `@PropertyInject` annotation which can be set on fields and setter
methods. For example, you can use that with `RouteBuilder` classes,
such as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

    @PropertyInject("hello")
    private String greeting;

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("direct:start")
            .transform().constant(greeting)
            .to("{{result}}");
    }
}
----

Notice we have annotated the greeting field with `@PropertyInject` and
define it to use the key `hello`. Camel will then lookup the property
with this key and inject its value, converted to a String type.

You can also use multiple placeholders and text in the key, for example
we can do:

[source,java]
----
@PropertyInject("Hello {{name}} how are you?")
private String greeting;
----

This will lookup the placeholder with they key `name`.

You can also add a default value if the key does not exist, such as:

[source,java]
----
@PropertyInject(value = "myTimeout", defaultValue = "5000")
private int timeout;
----
