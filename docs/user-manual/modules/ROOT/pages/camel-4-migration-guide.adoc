= Apache Camel 3.x to 4.0 Migration Guide

This document is intended to help you migrate your Apache Camel applications
from version 3.20 or higher to 4.0. If you are upgrading from an older Camel 3.x release,
such as 3.14, then make sure to read the individual xref:camel-3x-upgrade-guide.adoc[Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide]
to upgrade to the 3.20 release, prior to upgrade to Camel 4.

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading Camel 4.x to 4.y then use the
xref:camel-4x-upgrade-guide.adoc[Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide].

== Java versions

Camel 4 supports Java 17. Support for Java 11 is dropped.

|===

== Logging

Camel 4 has upgraded logging facade API `slf4j-api` from 1.7 to 2.0.

== JUnit 4

All the `camel-test` modules that were JUnit 4.x based has been removed. All test modules now use JUnit 5.

== API Changes

We have removed deprecated APIs such as the following:

- The `org.apache.camel.ExchangePattern` has removed `InOptionalOut`.
- Removed `getEndpointMap()` method from `CamelContext`.
- Removed `@FallbackConverter` as you should use `@Converter(fallback = true)` instead.
- Removed `uri` attribute on `@EndpointInject`, `@Produce`, and `@Consume` as you should use `value` (default) instead.
  For example `@Produce(uri = "kafka:cheese")` should be changed to `@Produce("kafka:cheese")`
- Removed `label` on `@UriEndpoint` as you should use `category` instead.
- Removed `consumerClass` on `@UriEndpoint`.
- Removed all `asyncCallback` methods on `ProducerTemplate`. Use `asyncSend` or `asyncRequest` instead.
- Removed `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStart`. Use `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStarting` instead.
- Removed `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStop`. Use `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStopping` instead.
- Decoupled the `org.apache.camel.ExtendedCamelContext` from the `org.apache.camel.CamelContext`.
- Replaced `adapt()` from `org.apache.camel.CamelContext` with `getCamelContextExtension`
- Decoupled the `org.apache.camel.ExtendedExchange` from the `org.apache.camel.Exchange`.
- Replaced `adapt()` from `org.apache.camel.ExtendedExchange` with `getExchangeExtension`
- Exchange failure handling status has moved from being a property defined as `ExchangePropertyKey.FAILURE_HANDLED` to a member of the ExtendedExchange, accessible via `isFailureHandled()`method.
- Removed `Discard` and `DiscardOldest` from `org.apache.camel.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolRejectedPolicy`.
- Removed `org.apache.camel.builder.SimpleBuilder`. Was mostly used internally in Camel with the Java DSL in some situations.
- Moved `org.apache.camel.support.IntrospectionSupport` to `camel-core-engine` for internal use only. End users should use `org.apache.camel.spi.BeanIntrospection` instead.
- Removed `archetypeCatalogAsXml` method from `org.apache.camel.catalog.CamelCatalog`.
- The `org.apache.camel.health.HealthCheck` method `isLiveness` is now default `false` instead of `true`.
- Added `position` method to `org.apache.camel.StreamCache`.
- The method `configure` from the interface `org.apache.camel.main.Listener` was removed
- The `org.apache.camel.support.EventNotifierSupport` abstract class now implements `CamelContextAware`.
- The type for `dumpRoutes` on `CamelContext` has changed from `boolean` to `String` to allow specifying either xml or yaml.

TIP: The `org.apache.camel.support.PluginHelper` gives easy access to various extensions and context plugins, that
was available previously in Camel v3 directly from `CamelContext`.

== EIP Changes

Removed `lang` attribute for the `<description>` on every EIPs.

The `InOnly` and `InOut` EIPs has been removed.
Instead, use `SetExchangePattern` or `To` where you can specify exchange pattern to use.

=== Poll Enrich EIP

The polled endpoint URI is now stored as property on the `Exchange` (with key `CamelToEndpoint`) like all other EIPs.
Before the URI was stored as a message header.

== CircuitBreaker EIP

The following options in `camel-resilience4j` was mistakenly not defined as attributes:

|===
| *Option*
| bulkheadEnabled
| bulkheadMaxConcurrentCalls
| bulkheadMaxWaitDuration
| timeoutEnabled
| timeoutExecutorService
| timeoutDuration
| timeoutCancelRunningFuture
|===

These options were not exposed in YAML DSL, and in XML DSL you need to migrate from:

[source,xml]
----
<circuitBreaker>
    <resilience4jConfiguration>
        <timeoutEnabled>true</timeoutEnabled>
        <timeoutDuration>2000</timeoutDuration>
    </resilience4jConfiguration>
...
</circuitBreaker>
----

To use attributes instead:

[source,xml]
----
<circuitBreaker>
    <resilience4jConfiguration timeoutEnabled="true" timeoutDuration="2000"/>
...
</circuitBreaker>
----


== XML DSL

The `<description>` to set a description on a route or node, has been changed from an element to an attribute.

Before:

[source,xml]
----
<route id="myRoute">
  <description>Something that this route do</description>
  <from uri="kafka:cheese"/>
  ...
</route>
----

After:

[source,xml]
----
<route id="myRoute" description="Something that this route do">
  <from uri="kafka:cheese"/>
  ...
</route>
----

== Type Converter

The `String` -> `java.io.File` converter has been removed.

== Tracing

The xref:tracer.adoc[Tracer] and xref:backlog-tracer.adoc[Backlog Tracer] no longer includes internal tracing events
from routes that was created by Rest DSL or route templates or Kamelets. You can turn this on, by setting
`traceTemplates=true` in the tracer.

The xref:backlog-tracer.adoc[Backlog Tracer] has been enhanced and _fixed_ to trace message headers (also streaming types).
This means that previously headers of type `InputStream` was not traced before, but is now included. This could mean that
the header stream is positioned at end, and logging the header afterward, may appear as the header value is empty.

== UseOriginalMessage / UseOriginalBody

When `useOriginalMessage` or `useOriginalBody` is enabled in `OnException`, `OnCompletion` or error handlers,
then the original message body is defensively copied and if possible converted to `StreamCache` to ensure
the body can be re-read when accessed. Previously the original body was not converted to `StreamCache` which
could lead to the body not able to be read or the stream has been closed.

== Camel Health

Health checks are now by default only readiness checks out of the box.

Camel provides the `CamelContextCheck` as both readiness and liveness checks, so there is at least
one of each out of the box.

Only consumer based health-checks is enabled by default.

=== Producer Health Checks

The option `camel.health.components-enabled` has been renamed to `camel.health.producers-enabled`.

Some components (in particular AWS) provides also health checks for producers; in Camel 3.x
these health checks did not work properly and has been disabled in the source.
To continue this behaviour in Camel 4, then producer based health checks are disabled.

Notice that `camel-kafka` comes with producer based health-check that worked in Camel 3,
and therefore this change in Camel 4, means that this health-check is disabled.

You *MUST* enable producer health-checks globally, such as in `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.producers-enabled = true
----

== JMX

Camel now also include MBeans for `doCatch` and `doFinally` in the tree of processor MBeans.

The `ManagedChoiceMBean` have renamed `choiceStatistics` to `extendedInformation`.
The `ManagedFailoverLoadBalancerMBean` have renamed `exceptionStatistics` to `extendedInformation`.

The `CamelContextMBean` and `CamelRouteMBean` has removed method `dumpRouteAsXml(boolean resolvePlaceholders, boolean resolveDelegateEndpoints)`.

== YAML DSL

The backwards compatible mode Camel 3.14 or older, which allowed to have _steps_ as child to _route_ has been removed.

The old syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: "direct:info"
    steps:
    - log: "message"
----

should be changed to:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: "direct:info"
      steps:
      - log: "message"
----

== Backlog Tracing

The option `backlogTracing=true` now automatic enabled the tracer on startup. The previous behavior
was _surprisingly_ that the tracer was only made available, and had to be manually enabled afterwards.
The old behavior can be archived by setting `backlogTracingStandby=true`.

Move the following class from `org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean.BacklogTracerEventMessage` in `camel-management-api` JAR
to `org.apache.camel.spi.BacklogTracerEventMessage` in `camel-api` JAR.

The `org.apache.camel.impl.debugger.DefaultBacklogTracerEventMessage` has been refactored into an interface `org.apache.camel.spi.BacklogTracerEventMessage`
with some additional details about traced messages. For example Camel now captures a _first_ and _last_ trace
that contains the input and outgoing (if `InOut`) messages.

== XML serialization

The default xml serialization using `ModelToXMLDumper` has been improved and now uses a generated xml
serializer located in the `camel-xml-io` module instead of the JAXB based one from `camel-jaxb`.

== OpenAPI Maven Plugin

The `camel-restdsl-openapi-plugin` Maven plugin now uses `platform-http` as the default rest component
in the generated Rest DSL code. Previously the default was servlet. However, platform-http is a better
default that works out of the box with Spring Boot and Quarkus.

== Component changes

=== Category

The number of enums for `org.apache.camel.Category` has been reduced from 83 to 37, which means custom components
that are using removed values need to choose one of the remainder values. We have done this to consolidate
the number of categories of all components in the Camel community.

=== camel-openapi-rest-dsl-generator

This dsl-generator has updated the underlying model classes (`apicurio-data-models`) from 1.1.27 to 2.0.3.

=== camel-atom

The `camel-atom` component has changed the 3rd party atom client from Apache Abdera to RSSReader.
This means the feed object is changed from `org.apache.abdera.model.Feed` to `com.apptasticsoftware.rssreader.Item`.

=== camel-azure-cosmosdb

The `itemPartitionKey` has been updated. It's now a String a not a PartitionKey anymore. More details in CAMEL-19222.

=== camel-bean

When using the `method` option to refer to a specific method, and using parameter types and values, such as:
`"bean:myBean?method=foo(com.foo.MyOrder, true)"` then any class types must now be using `.class` syntax,
i.e. `com.foo.MyOrder` should now be `com.foo.MyOrder.class`.

The example from above should now be as follows:

    "bean:myBean?method=foo(com.foo.MyOrder.class, true)"

This also applies to Java types such as String, int, etc:

    "bean:myBean?method=bar(String.class, int.class)"

=== camel-box

Upgraded from Box Java SDK v2 to v4, which have some method signature changes.
The method to get a file thumbnail is no longer available.

=== camel-caffeine

The `keyType` parameter has been removed. The Key for the cache will now be only `String` type. More information in CAMEL-18877.

=== camel-fhir

The underlying `hapi-fhir` library has been upgraded from 4.2.0 to 6.2.4. Only the `Delete` API method has changed and now returns `ca.uhn.fhir.rest.api.MethodOutcome` instead of `org.hl7.fhir.instance.model.api.IBaseOperationOutcome`. See https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/blog/ for a more detailed list of underlying changes (only the hapi-fhir client is used in Camel).

=== camel-google

The API based components `camel-google-drive`, `camel-google-calendar`, `camel-google-sheets` and `camel-google-mail`
has been upgraded from Google Java SDK v1 to v2 and to latest API revisions. The `camel-google-drive` and `camel-google-sheets`
have some API methods changes, but the others are identical as before.

=== camel-http

The component has been upgraded to use Apache HttpComponents v5 which has an impact on how the underlying client is configured. There are 4 different
timeouts (`connectionRequestTimeout`, `connectTimeout`, `soTimeout` and `responseTimeout`) instead of initially 3
(`connectionRequestTimeout`, `connectTimeout` and `socketTimeout`) and the default value of some of them has changed so please refer to the documentation
for more details.

Please note that the `socketTimeout` has been removed from the possible configuration parameters of `HttpClient`, use `responseTimeout` instead.

Finally, the option `soTimeout` along with any parameters included into `SocketConfig`, need to be prefixed by `httpConnection.`,
the rest of the parameters including those defined into `HttpClientBuilder` and `RequestConfig` still need to be prefixed by `httpClient.` like before.

=== camel-http-common

The API in `org.apache.camel.http.common.HttpBinding` has changed slightly to be more reusable.
The `parseBody` method now takes in `HttpServletRequest` as input parameter. And all `HttpMessage`
has been changed to generic `Message` types.

=== camel-kubernetes

The `io.fabric8:kubernetes-client` library has been upgraded and some deprecated API usage has been removed. Operations previously prefixed with `replace` are now prefixed with `update`.

For example `replaceConfigMap` is now `updateConfigMap`, `replacePod` is now `updatePod` etc. The corresponding 
constants in class `KubernetesOperations` are also renamed. `REPLACE_CONFIGMAP_OPERATION` is now `UPDATE_CONFIGMAP_OPERATION`, `REPLACE_POD_OPERATION` is now `UPDATE_POD_OPERATION` etc.

=== camel-web3j

The `camel-web3j` has upgrade web3j JAR from 3.x to 5.0 which has many API changes, and so
some previous API calls are no long provided.

=== camel-main

The following constants has been moved from `BaseMainSupport` / `Main` to `MainConstants`:

|===
| Old Name | New Name
| Main.DEFAULT_PROPERTY_PLACEHOLDER_LOCATION | MainConstants.DEFAULT_PROPERTY_PLACEHOLDER_LOCATION
| Main.INITIAL_PROPERTIES_LOCATION | MainConstants.INITIAL_PROPERTIES_LOCATION
| Main.OVERRIDE_PROPERTIES_LOCATION | MainConstants.OVERRIDE_PROPERTIES_LOCATION
| Main.PROPERTY_PLACEHOLDER_LOCATION | MainConstants.PROPERTY_PLACEHOLDER_LOCATION
|===


=== camel-micrometer

The metrics has been renamed to follow Micrometer naming convention https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_naming_meters[Naming Meters].

|===
| Old Name | New Name
| CamelExchangeEventNotifier | camel.exchange.event.notifier
| CamelExchangesFailed | camel.exchanges.failed
| CamelExchangesFailuresHandled | camel.exchanges.failures.handled
| CamelExchangesInflight | camel.exchanges.external.redeliveries
| CamelExchangesSucceeded | camel.exchanges.succeeded
| CamelExchangesTotal | camel.exchanges.total
| CamelMessageHistory | camel.message.history
| CamelRoutePolicy | camel.route.policy
| CamelRoutePolicyLongTask | camel.route.policy.long.task
| CamelRoutesAdded | camel.routes.added
| CamelRoutesRunning | camel.routes.running
|===

=== camel-jbang

The command `camel dependencies` has been renamed to `camel dependency`.

In Camel JBang the `-dir` parameter for `init` and `run` goal has been renamed to require 2 dashes `--dir` like all the other options.

The `camel stop` command will now by default stop all running integrations (the option `--all` has been removed).

The _Placeholders substitutes_ is changed to use `#name` instead of `$name` syntax.

=== camel-openapi-java

The `camel-openapi-java` component has been changed to use `io.swagger.v3` libraries instead of `io.apicurio.datamodels`.
As a result, the return type of the public method org.apache.camel.openapi.RestOpenApiReader.read() is now `io.swagger.v3.oas.models.OpenAPI` instead of `io.apicurio.datamodels.openapi.models.OasDocument`.
When an OpenAPI 2.0 (swagger) specification is parsed, it is automatically upgraded to OpenAPI 3.0.x by the swagger parser.
This version also supports OpenAPI 3.1.x specifications.
The related spring-boot starter components have been modified to use the new return type.

=== camel-optaplanner

The `camel-optaplanner` component has been change to use `SolverManager`. If you were using `SoverManager` in Camel 3, you don't need anymore the boolean useSolverManager in the Route.
Deprecated `ProblemFactChange` has been replaced by `ProblemChange`.

The new URI path is:

[source,java]
----
from("optaplanner:myProblemName")
  .to("...")
----

You can pass the Optaplanner SolverManager in 2 ways:

- as #parameter
- as header

When running `camel-optaplanner` on Spring Boot or Quarkus, it is preferable to use the Spring Boot or Quarkus way of creating the SolverManager.

It is possible to migrate legacy Camel Optaplanner Routes, by putting the XML config file, as show in the code below. Camel Optaplanner will handle creating the SolverManager for those legacy Routes:

[source,java]
----
from("optaplanner:myProblemName?configFile=PATH/TO/CONFIG.FILE.xml")
  .to("...")
----

Solver Daemon solutions should be migrated to use SolverManager.

=== camel-platform-http-vertx

If the route or consumer is suspended then http status 503 is now returned instead of 404.

=== camel-salesforce

Property names of blob fields on generated DTOs no longer have 'Url' affixed. E.g., the `ContentVersionUrl` property is now just `ContentVersion`.

=== camel-slack

The default delay (on slack consumer) is changed from 0.5s to 10s to avoid being rate limited to often by Slack.

=== camel-spring-rabbitmq

The option `replyTimeout` in `camel-spring-rabbitmq` has been fixed and the default value from 5 to 30 seconds
(this is the default used by Spring).


== Camel Spring Boot

The `camel-spring-boot` dependency no longer includes `camel-spring-xml`. To use legacy Spring XML files `<beans>`
with Camel on Spring Boot, then include the `camel-spring-boot-xml-starter` dependency.

=== Graceful Shutdown

Camel now shutdowns a bit later during Spring Boot shutdown. This allows Spring Boot graceful shutdown
to complete first (stopping Spring Boot HTTP server gracefully),
and then afterward Camel is doing its own xref:graceful-shutdown.adoc[].

Technically `camel-spring` has changed `getPhase()` from returning `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to
`Integer.MAX_VALUE - 2049`. This gives room for Spring Boot services to shut down first.

=== camel-micrometer-starter

The `uri` tags are now static instead of dynamic (by default), as potential too many tags generated due to URI with dynamic values.
This can be enabled again by setting `camel.metrics.uriTagDynamic=true`.

=== camel-platform-http-starter

The `platform-http-starter` has been changed from using `camel-servlet` to use Spring HTTP server directly.
Therefore, all the HTTP endpoints are no longer prefixed with the servlet context-path (default is `camel`).

For example:

[source,java]
----
from("platform-http:myservice")
  .to("...")
----

Then calling _myservice_ would before require to include the context-path, such as `http://localhost:8080/camel/myservice`.
Now the context-path is not in use, and the endpoint can be called with `http://localhost:8080/myservice`.

NOTE: The `platform-http-starter` can also be used with Rest DSL.

If the route or consumer is suspended then http status 503 is now returned instead of 404.

=== camel-twitter

The component was updated to use Twitter4j version 4.1.2, which https://twitter4j.org/2022/10/21/264[has moved the packages] used by a few of its classes. If accessing certain twitter-related data, such as the Twit status, you need to update the packages used from `twitter4j.Status` to `twitter4j.v1.Status`.
