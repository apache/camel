= Apache Camel 3.x to 4.0 Migration Guide

This document is intended to help you migrate your Apache Camel applications
from version 3.20 or higher to 4.0. If you are upgrading from an older Camel 3.x release,
such as 3.14, then make sure to read the individual xref:camel-3x-upgrade-guide.adoc[Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide]
to upgrade to the 3.20 release, prior to upgrade to Camel 4.

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading Camel 4.x to 4.y then use the
xref:camel-4x-upgrade-guide.adoc[Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide].

== Java versions

Camel 4 supports Java 17. Support for Java 11 is dropped.

|===

== Logging

Camel 4 has upgraded logging facade API `slf4j-api` from 1.7 to 2.0.

== JUnit 4

All the `camel-test` modules that were JUnit 4.x based has been removed. All test modules now use JUnit 5.

== API Changes

We have removed deprecated APIs such as the following:

- The `org.apache.camel.ExchangePattern` has removed `InOptionalOut`.
- Removed `getEndpointMap()` method from `CamelContext`.
- Removed `@FallbackConverter` as you should use `@Converter(fallback = true)` instead.
- Removed `uri` attribute on `@EndpointInject`, `@Produce`, and `@Consume` as you should use `value` (default) instead.
  For example `@Produce(uri = "kafka:cheese")` should be changed to `@Produce("kafka:cheese")`
- Removed `label` on `@UriEndpoint` as you should use `category` instead.
- Removed all `asyncCallback` methods on `ProducerTemplate`. Use `asyncSend` or `asyncRequest` instead.
- Removed `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStart`. Use `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStarting` instead.
- Removed `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStop`. Use `org.apache.camel.spi.OnCamelContextStopping` instead.
- Decoupled the `org.apache.camel.ExtendedCamelContext` from the `org.apache.camel.CamelContext`.
- Replaced `adapt()` from `org.apache.camel.CamelContext` with `getCamelContextExtension`
- Decoupled the `org.apache.camel.ExtendedExchange` from the `org.apache.camel.Exchange`.
- Replaced `adapt()` from `org.apache.camel.ExtendedExchange` with `getExchangeExtension`
- Exchange failure handling status has moved from being a property defined as `ExchangePropertyKey.FAILURE_HANDLED` to a member of the ExtendedExchange, accessible via `isFailureHandled()`method.
- Removed `Discard` and `DiscardOldest` from `org.apache.camel.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolRejectedPolicy`.
- Removed `org.apache.camel.builder.SimpleBuilder`. Was mostly used internally in Camel with the Java DSL in some situations.
- Moved `org.apache.camel.support.IntrospectionSupport` to `camel-core-engine` for internal use only. End users should use `org.apache.camel.spi.BeanInspection` instead.
- Removed `archetypeCatalogAsXml` method from `org.apache.camel.catalog.CamelCatalog`.
- The `org.apache.camel.health.HealthCheck` method `isLiveness` is now default `false` instead of `true`.

== EIP Changes

Removed `lang` attribute for the `<description>` on every EIPs.

The `InOnly` and `InOut` EIPs has been removed.
Instead, use `SetExchangePattern` or `To` where you can specify exchange pattern to use.

=== UseOriginalMessage / UseOriginalBody

When `useOriginalMessage` or `useOriginalBody` is enabled in `OnException`, `OnCompletion` or error handlers,
then the original message body is defensively copied and if possible converted to `StreamCache` to ensure
the body can be re-read when accessed. Previously the original body was not converted to `StreamCache` which
could lead to the body not able to be read or the stream has been closed.

== Camel Health

Health checks are now by default only readiness checks out of the box.

Camel provides the `CamelContextCheck` as both readiness and liveness checks, so there is at least
one of each out of the box.

== YAML DSL

The backwards compatible mode Camel 3.14 or older, which allowed to have _steps_ as child to _route_ has been removed.

The old syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: "direct:info"
    steps:
    - log: "message"
----

should be changed to:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: "direct:info"
      steps:
      - log: "message"
----

== Backlog Tracing

The option `backlogTracing=true` now automatic enabled the tracer on startup. The previous behavior
was _surprisingly_ that the tracer was only made available, and had to be manually enabled afterwards.
The old behavior can be archived by setting `backlogTracingStandby=true`.

Move the following class from `org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean.BacklogTracerEventMessage` in `camel-management-api` JAR
to `org.apache.camel.spi.BacklogTracerEventMessage` in `camel-api` JAR.

The `org.apache.camel.impl.debugger.DefaultBacklogTracerEventMessage` has been refactored into an interface `org.apache.camel.spi.BacklogTracerEventMessage`
with some additional details about traced messages. For example Camel now captures a _first_ and _last_ trace
that contains the input and outgoing (if `InOut`) messages.

== XML serialization

The default xml serialization using `ModelToXMLDumper` has been improved and now uses a generated xml
serializer located in the `camel-xml-io` module instead of the JAXB based one from `camel-jaxb`.

== Component changes

=== camel-caffeine

The `keyType` parameter has been removed. The Key for the cache will now be only `String` type. More information in CAMEL-18877.

=== camel-fhir

The underlying `hapi-fhir` library has been upgraded from 4.2.0 to 6.2.4. Only the `Delete` API method has changed and now returns `ca.uhn.fhir.rest.api.MethodOutcome` instead of `org.hl7.fhir.instance.model.api.IBaseOperationOutcome`. See https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/blog/ for a more detailed list of underlying changes (only the hapi-fhir client is used in Camel).

=== camel-http

The component has been upgraded to use Apache HttpComponents v5 which has an impact on how the underlying client is configured. There are 4 different
timeouts (`connectionRequestTimeout`, `connectTimeout`, `soTimeout` and `responseTimeout`) instead of initially 3
(`connectionRequestTimeout`, `connectTimeout` and `socketTimeout`) and the default value of some of them has changed so please refer to the documentation
for more details.

Please note that the `socketTimeout` has been removed from the possible configuration parameters of `HttpClient`, use `responseTimeout` instead.

Finally, the option `soTimeout` along with any parameters included into `SocketConfig`, need to be prefixed by `httpConnection.`,
the rest of the parameters including those defined into `HttpClientBuilder` and `RequestConfig` still need to be prefixed by `httpClient.` like before.

=== camel-http-common

The API in `org.apache.camel.http.common.HttpBinding` has changed slightly to be more reusable.
The `parseBody` method now takes in `HttpServletRequest` as input parameter. And all `HttpMessage`
has been changed to generic `Message` types.

=== camel-micrometer

The metrics has been renamed to follow Micrometer naming convention https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_naming_meters[Naming Meters].

|===
| Old Name | New Name
| CamelExchangeEventNotifier | camel.exchange.event.notifier
| CamelExchangesFailed | camel.exchanges.failed
| CamelExchangesFailuresHandled | camel.exchanges.failures.handled
| CamelExchangesInflight | camel.exchanges.external.redeliveries
| CamelExchangesSucceeded | camel.exchanges.succeeded
| CamelExchangesTotal | camel.exchanges.total
| CamelMessageHistory | camel.message.history
| CamelRoutePolicy | camel.route.policy
| CamelRoutePolicyLongTask | camel.route.policy.long.task
| CamelRoutesAdded | camel.routes.added
| CamelRoutesRunning | camel.routes.running
|===

== Camel Spring Boot

The `camel-spring-boot` dependency no longer includes `camel-spring-xml`. To use legacy Spring XML files `<beans>`
with Camel on Spring Boot, then include the `camel-spring-boot-xml-starter` dependency.

=== camel-micrometer-starter

The `uri` tags are now static instead of dynamic (by default), as potential too many tags generated due to URI with dynamic values.
This can be enabled again by setting `camel.metrics.uriTagDynamic=true`.

=== camel-platform-http-starter

The `platform-http-starter` has been changed from using `camel-servlet` to use Spring HTTP server directly.
Therefore, all the HTTP endpoints are no longer prefixed with the servlet context-path (default is `camel`).

For example:

[source,java]
----
from("platform-http:myservice")
  .to("...")
----

Then calling _myservice_ would before require to include the context-path, such as `http://localhost:8080/camel/myservice`.
Now the context-path is not in use, and the endpoint can be called with `http://localhost:8080/myservice`.

NOTE: The `platform-http-starter` can also be used with Rest DSL.
