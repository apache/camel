[[URIs-URIs]]
= URIs

Camel makes extensive use of URIs to allow you to refer to endpoints
which are lazily created by a xref:component.adoc[Component] if you
refer to them within xref:routes.adoc[Routes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to read
xref:faq/how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints]
to learn more about configuring endpoints. For
example how to refer to beans in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] or how
to use raw values for password options, and using
xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders] etc.
