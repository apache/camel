= URIs

Camel makes extensive use of URIs to allow you to refer to xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoints].

For example, consider the following URI:

[source,text]
----
kafka:cheese?brokers=mykafka:1234&clientId=foo
----

This endpoint is created by the xref:components::kafka-component.adoc[Kafka] component.
The URI contains endpoint configurations as context-path and query parameters.
In this example, the context-path is `cheese` which is the kafka topic to use.

The query parameters have two parameters:

1. `brokers=mykafka:1234`: the remote Kafka broker to connect to.
2. `clientId=foo`: the client id, which is a configuration of the Kafka component

== More Information

You can read the guide xref:faq:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints] to learn more about configuring _endpoints_. Among other things, this guide explains how to refer to beans in the xref:registry.adoc[registry], how to use raw values for password options, how to use xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders], or how to use the type safe xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] and xref:dataformat-dsl.adoc[DataFormat DSL].
