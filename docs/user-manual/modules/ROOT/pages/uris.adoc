= URIs

Camel makes extensive use of URIs to allow you to refer to xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint]s.

For example the following URI:

[source,text]
----
kafka:cheese?brokers=mykafka:1234&clientId=foo
----

This endpoint is created by the xref:components::kafka-component.adoc[Kafka] component.
The URI contains endpoint configurations as context-path and query parameters.
In this example the context-path is `cheese` which is the kafka topic to use.

The query parameters have two parameters:

- `brokers=mykafka:1234` which is the remote Kafka broker to connect to.
- `clientId=foo` is the client id

Make sure to read
xref:faq:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints]
to learn more about configuring endpoints. For
example how to refer to beans in the xref:registry.adoc[registry] or how
to use raw values for password options, and using
xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders], or how to use
the type safe xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] and xref:dataformat-dsl.adoc[DataFormat DSL].
