To support flexible and powerful
xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns], Camel supports various Languages to create an
xref:expression.adoc[Expression] or xref:predicate.adoc[Predicate]
within either the xref:dsl.adoc[Routing Domain Specific Language] or the
xref:xml-configuration.adoc[XML Configuration].

== Note
*Combining Predicates**

When creating predicates (expressions that evaluate to `true` or
`false`), you can combine several predicates -- regardless of the
language they are built with -- by using the `PredicateBuilder` class.
For more information, see xref:predicate.adoc[Compound Predicates].
