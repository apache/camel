= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.3 to 4.4

=== camel-core

Removed the deprecated constructor from the internal class `org.apache.camel.util.StopWatch`. Users of this class are advised to
use the default constructor if necessary.

=== camel-azure-cosmosdb

The useDefaultIdentity parameter has been removed in favor of the credentialType parameter. Now user should select between SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY and AZURE_IDENTITY.
This is part of the effort explained in CAMEL-18590.
