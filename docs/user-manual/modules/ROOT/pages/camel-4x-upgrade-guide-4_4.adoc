= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.3 to 4.4

=== camel-core

Removed the deprecated constructor from the internal class `org.apache.camel.util.StopWatch`. Users of this class are advised to
use the default constructor if necessary.

The method `getCreated` is now deprecated. Access to the time-related information from the exchange should be done via `getClock`.

=== camel-azure-cosmosdb

The useDefaultIdentity parameter has been removed in favor of the credentialType parameter. Now user should select between SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY and AZURE_IDENTITY.
This is part of the effort explained in CAMEL-18590.

=== camel-azure-eventhubs

The credentialType parameter has been introduced with three possible values: AZURE_IDENTITY, CONNECTION_STRING and TOKEN_CREDENTIAL.
With the CONNECTION_STRING mode the user could explicitly set the connectionString parameters or use the sharedAccessName and sharedAccessKey to automatically build the connection string.
With the TOKEN_CREDENTIAL mode the user could pass a TokenCredential instance.
With the AZURE_IDENTITY mode the user will be able to use the Default Azure Credentials Chain.
This is part of the effort explained in CAMEL-18590.

=== camel-azure-servicebus

The credentialType parameter has been introduced with three possible values: AZURE_IDENTITY, CONNECTION_STRING and TOKEN_CREDENTIAL.
With the CONNECTION_STRING mode the user could explicitly set the connectionString parameter.
With the TOKEN_CREDENTIAL mode the user could pass a TokenCredential instance.
With the AZURE_IDENTITY mode the user will be able to use the Default Azure Credentials Chain.
