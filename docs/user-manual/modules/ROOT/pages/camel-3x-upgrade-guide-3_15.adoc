= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.14 to 3.15

IMPORTANT: Java 8 is no longer supported. Camel 3.15 onwards requires Java 11 or 17.

=== Removed components

The `camel-kamelet-reify` and `camel-spring-javaconfig` has been removed.

=== API changes

Added `getScheme` method to `org.apache.camel.spi.Resource`.

=== Core Dependency changes

As part of CAMEL-17429 and CAMEL-17435, the following dependencies are no longer included by default on all the Camel modules:

 * com.sun.xml.messaging.saaj:saaj-impl
 * jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api
 * javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api
 * javax.xml.soap:javax.xml.soap-api
 * javax.xml.ws:jaxws-api
 * org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-jta_1.1_spec
 * org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-ws-metadata_2.0_spec
 * org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime

These dependencies were included on the specific modules and components that required them on a per-case basis.

Applications with dependency on any of those, but using them transitively, should be modified to include them.

=== camel-core

Removed the deprecated `Classic` value from `startupSummaryLevel` enums.

The deprecated `propertyName` on `removeProperty` EIP has been removed, use `name` instead.

=== Data Formats

The data formats naming has been made consistent to use Camel Case:

[width="100%",cols="1m,1m",options="header"]
|====
| Old Name | New Name
| gzip-deflater | gzipDeflater
| zip-deflater | zipDeflater
| jacksonxml | jacksonXml
| mime-multipart | mimeMultipart
| secureXML | xmlSecurity
| soapjaxb | soap
| univociy-csv | univociyCsv
| univociy-fixed | univociyFixed
| univociy-tsv | univociyTsv
| tarfile | tarFile
| zipfile | zipFile
|====

==== Message History

The message history output has changed to include source column, which refers to the Java class/XML file
from the DSL the message was at the given time. (line precise error reporting).

This default formatting are (Source, ID, Processor, Elapsed):
```
    MESSAGE_HISTORY_HEADER = "%-40s %-30s %-50s %-12s";
    MESSAGE_HISTORY_OUTPUT = "%-40.40s %-30.30s %-50.50s %12.12s";
```

If you are using custom sizes then you need to adjust accordingly.

=== camel-endpointdsl

The Endpoint DSL is now more type-safe, where previously an option would be declared as `Object` type,
is now declared using its actual type, such as `javax.sql.DataSource`.

Option that are enums is now using the real enum FQN class name, instead of a duplicate enum
class that was embedded inside the Endpoint DSL. For example when using `aws2sq` the
namingStrategy enum is changed from `org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.dsl.AWS2S3EndpointBuilderFactory`
to `org.apache.camel.component.aws2.s3.stream.AWSS3NamingStrategyEnum` class name.

=== camel-management

The route controller MBeans are moved from `routecontrollers` to the existing `services`
node in the JMX MBean tree.

Removed deprecated operations on `CamelContextMBean` and `CamelRouteMBean`.

=== camel-util

Deleted the `replaceAll` method of `org.apache.camel.util.StringHelper`. Please use the `replace` method of `java.lang.String` instead, as it is much faster from Java 11 onward.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

Removed `steps` from `route` because steps should only be configured on `from` making
the DSL consistent and similar to Java DSL.

Before it was possible to do:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    id: demo-route
    from:
      uri: "timer:info"
    steps:
      - log: "message"
----

This should correctly be done with `steps` as child of `from`:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    id: demo-route
    from:
      uri: "timer:info"
      steps:
        - log: "message"
----

=== camel-jbang

The JBang app that was previously named `CamelJBang` is now named `camel`. It is still possible to use the older name by installing it using `CamelJBang@apache/camel` but this approach is deprecated and should not be used in the future.

=== camel-debezium

Upgraded to Debezium 1.8 which requires Java 11 and Kafka Client 3.0 JARs.

=== camel-cdi

The legacy XML in `camel-cdi` with `<camelContext>` is deprecated, instead the XML DSL route loader should be used.

JTA support is moved out of `camel-cdi` to its own `camel-cdi-jta` module.

The `org.apache.camel.cdi.Main` class has moved from `camel-cdi` to `camel-cdi-main` JAR.

=== camel-karaf

The `camel-endpointdsl` and `camel-componentdsl` is no longer supported on Apache Karaf.

The `camel-osg-activator` and `camel-google-mail` has been removed.

=== camel-netty / camel-netty-http

The netty producer has migrated from commons-poll v1 to v2.
The option `producerPoolMaxActive` is renamed to `producerPoolMaxTotal`.

=== camel-quartz

Removed the option `startDelaySeconds` as this does not work correctly and causes problems if in use.

=== camel-rabbitmq

The rabbitmq producer has migrated from commons-poll v1 to v2.
