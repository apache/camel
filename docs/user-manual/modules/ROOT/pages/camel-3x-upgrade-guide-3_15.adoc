= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.14 to 3.15

=== API changes

Added `getScheme` method to `org.apache.camel.spi.Resource`.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

Removed `steps` from `route` because steps should only be configured on `from` making
the DSL consistent and similar to Java DSL.

Before it was possible to do:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    id: demo-route
    from:
      uri: "timer:info"
    steps:
      - log: "message"
----

This should correctly be done with `steps` as child of `from`:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    id: demo-route
    from:
      uri: "timer:info"
      steps:
        - log: "message"
----
