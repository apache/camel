= Message Expiration

Camel supports the
https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessageExpiration.html[Message Expiration]
from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP patterns].

How can a sender indicate when a message should be considered stale and thus shouldnâ€™t be processed?

Set the Message Expiration to specify a time limit how long the message is viable.

Message expiration is supported by some Camel components such as xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS]
or which allows to set a time-to-live value on messages sent to the broker.
The xref:components::aws-sqs-component.adoc[AWS SQS] supports message expiration using its _message visibility_ settings.

TIP: When using message expiration then mind about keeping clock's synchronized among the systems.

== Sample

A message should expire after 5 seconds, if a consumer is not available to receive and process the message.
