= Camel JBang Launcher

*Available as of Camel 4.13*

This module provides a self-contained executable JAR that includes all dependencies required to run Camel JBang without the need for the JBang two-step process.

The launcher uses Spring Boot's loader tools to create a self-executing JAR with a nested structure, similar to Spring Boot's executable JARs. This provides better performance and avoids classpath conflicts compared to traditional fat JARs.

== Downloading

You can download the `camel-launcher` JAR from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/camel-launcher/[Maven Central].

== Using the fat-jar directly

Then you can run the JAR using standard Java as follows:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar camel-launcher-<version>.jar [command] [options]
----

For example:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar camel-launcher-<version>.jar version
java -jar camel-launcher-<version>.jar run hello.java
----

== Using the distribution (recommended)

Extract the distribution archive:

[source,bash]
----
unzip camel-launcher-<version>-bin.zip
# or
tar -xzf camel-launcher-<version>-bin.tar.gz
----

And then use the provided scripts:

[source,bash]
----
# On Unix/Linux
./bin/camel.sh [command] [options]

# On Windows
bin\camel.bat [command] [options]
----

== Benefits of using Camel Launcher

- No need for JBang installation
- Single executable JAR with all dependencies included
- Faster startup time (no dependency resolution step, on-demand class loading)
- Better memory usage (only loads classes that are actually used)
- Avoids classpath conflicts (dependencies kept as separate JARs)
- Each self-executing JAR is its own release, avoiding version complexity
- Can still be used with JBang if preferred
