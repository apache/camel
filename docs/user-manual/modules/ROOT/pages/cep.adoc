http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing[Complex Event
Processing] or
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_stream_processing[Event Stream
Processing] are approaches of processing streams of events, usually from
multiple sources.

Another approach to CEP with Camel is to use Camel RX
which provides a typesafe DSL in Java, Scala, Groovy, clojure for
processing events in a natural collection-like way (while being high
performance and asynchronous under the covers). Camel RX
uses the https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/wiki[RxJava]
http://netflix.github.com/RxJava/javadoc/[API] which is a JVM port of
the https://rx.codeplex.com/[Reactive Extensions]

== CEP with Camel RX

Camel RX provides various ways to get an
http://netflix.github.com/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable.html[Observable<T>]
which provides the typesafe DSL for processing events on a single
stream.

Once you have an
http://netflix.github.com/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable.html[Observable<T>]
you can then:
