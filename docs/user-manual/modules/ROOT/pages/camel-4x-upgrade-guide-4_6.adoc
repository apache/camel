= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.5 to 4.6

=== variables

When using `variableReceive` then the variable is only set if processing the `Exchange` was completely successfully.

For example calling a route that fails due to an exception being thrown (even if `onException` or `errorHandler` are in use)
then the variable is no longer set. Also, if the route is marked for rollback, or to stop continue routing with `.stop()`.

This is the same logic that the routing engine uses, whether to continue routing the `Exchange` or not.

=== camel-as2

The `camel-as2` component has upgraded HTTP Client 4.x to 5.x and because of that, there are some options that have changed.

=== camel-elasticsearch

The class `org.apache.camel.component.es.aggregation.ElastichsearchBulkRequestAggregationStrategy` has been renamed to `org.apache.camel.component.es.aggregation.ElasticsearchBulkRequestAggregationStrategy`.

=== camel-rest-openapi

The `specifciationUri` in the `rest-api` component has changed from being a `java.net.URI` to a `String` type
, as it uses Camels `ResourceLoader` to load from pluggable resources and also more tooling friendly.

The validator using Atlassian `swagger-request-validator` JAR has been removed, as this library is not JakartaEE compatible,
and was causing classloading problems. The validator is now using similar validation as Rest DSL. However, the validator
no longer check for JSon payloads if any required nodes is missing.

=== camel-langchain4j-chat

The Camel Langchain4j Chat component name has been changed from `camel-langchain-chat`to `camel-langchain4j-chat` to adhere to the standardized naming conventions within the LangChain4j ecosystem.

If you are migrating from Camel 4.5, please ensure the following:

- Update your maven dependencies, changing from `camel-langchain-chat`to `camel-langchain4j-chat`
- Adjust your endpoints, replacing `langchain-chat` with `langchain4j-chat`
- Transfer any Camel class references from `org.apache.camel.component.chat.ChatLangchain*` to `org.apache.camel.component.langchain4j.chat.ChatLangchain4j*`
- Modify the header name `The prompt Template`  from  `CamelLangChainChatPromptTemplate` to `CamelLangChain4jChatPromptTemplate`

=== camel-langchain4j-embeddings

The Camel Langchain4j Embeddings component name has been changed from `camel-langchain-embedings` to `camel-langchain4j-embedings` to adhere to the standardized naming conventions within the LangChain4j ecosystem.

If you are migrating from Camel 4.5, please ensure the following

- Update your maven dependencies, changing from  `camel-langchain-embedings`to `camel-langchain4j-embedings`
- Adjust your endpoints, replacing `langchain-embedings` with `langchain4j-embedings`
- Transfer any Camel class references from `org.apache.camel.component.langchain.embeddings.LangChainEmbeddings*` to `org.apache.camel.component.langchain4j.embeddings.LangChain4jEmbeddings*`
- Modify the header name `The Finish Reason` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsFinishReason` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsFinishReason`
- Modify the header name `The Input Token Count` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsInputTokenCount` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsInputTokenCount`
- Modify the header name `The Output Token Count` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsOutputTokenCount` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsOutputTokenCount`
- Modify the header name `The Total Token Count` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsTotalTokenCount` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsTotalTokenCount`
- Modify the header name `A dense vector embedding of a text` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsVector` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsVector`

=== camel-platform-http

The `PlatformHttpEngine` class has changed the `createConsumer` method to return a `org.apache.camel.component.platform.http.spi.PlatformHttpConsumer` type,
instead of `org.apache.camel.Consumer`.

=== camel-platform-http-vertx

The id used for multipart file upload attachments on `AttachmentMessage` has changed from being the name of the uploaded file, to the value specifed on the `name` field of the `Content-Disposition` header sent in the request body.

=== camel-kafka

The Kafka component now supports custom subscription adapters for applications with very complex subscription logic.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

  from:
    uri: "direct:foo"
    steps:
      - to: "mock:bar"
----

After:

[source,yaml]
----
route:
  streamCache: false
  from:
    uri: "direct:foo"
