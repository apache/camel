= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.5 to 4.6

=== variables

When using `variableReceive` then the variable is only set if processing the `Exchange` was completely successfully.

For example calling a route that fails due to an exception being thrown (even if `onException` or `errorHandler` are in use)
then the variable is no longer set. Also, if the route is marked for rollback, or to stop continue routing with `.stop()`.

This is the same logic that the routing engine uses, whether to continue routing the `Exchange` or not.

=== XML DSL

When using XML DSL to define properties on `<bean>` then `<property>` must now be declared inside `<properties>`.

=== YAML DSL

When using YAML DSL to define properties on `bean` then `property` has been removed in favour of using `properties`.

Before:
[source,yaml]
----
    beans:
      - name: "myProcessor"
        type: "#class:com.foo.MyClass"
        property:
          - key: "payload"
            value: "test-payload"
----

After:
[source,yaml]
----
    beans:
      - name: "myProcessor"
        type: "#class:com.foo.MyClass"
        properties:
          payload: "test-payload"
----

=== camel-as2

The `camel-as2` component has upgraded HTTP Client 4.x to 5.x and because of that, there are some options that have changed.

=== camel-elasticsearch

The class `org.apache.camel.component.es.aggregation.ElastichsearchBulkRequestAggregationStrategy` has been renamed to `org.apache.camel.component.es.aggregation.ElasticsearchBulkRequestAggregationStrategy`.

=== camel-rest-openapi

The `specifciationUri` in the `rest-api` component has changed from being a `java.net.URI` to a `String` type
, as it uses Camels `ResourceLoader` to load from pluggable resources and also more tooling friendly.

The validator using Atlassian `swagger-request-validator` JAR has been removed, as this library is not JakartaEE compatible,
and was causing classloading problems. The validator is now using similar validation as Rest DSL. However, the validator
no longer check for JSon payloads if any required nodes is missing.

=== camel-langchain4j-chat

The Camel Langchain4j Chat component name has been changed from `camel-langchain-chat`to `camel-langchain4j-chat` to adhere to the standardized naming conventions within the LangChain4j ecosystem.

If you are migrating from Camel 4.5, please ensure the following:

- Update your maven dependencies, changing from `camel-langchain-chat`to `camel-langchain4j-chat`
- Adjust your endpoints, replacing `langchain-chat` with `langchain4j-chat`
- Transfer any Camel class references from `org.apache.camel.component.chat.ChatLangchain*` to `org.apache.camel.component.langchain4j.chat.ChatLangchain4j*`
- Modify the header name `The prompt Template`  from  `CamelLangChainChatPromptTemplate` to `CamelLangChain4jChatPromptTemplate`

=== camel-langchain4j-embeddings

The Camel Langchain4j Embeddings component name has been changed from `camel-langchain-embedings` to `camel-langchain4j-embedings` to adhere to the standardized naming conventions within the LangChain4j ecosystem.

If you are migrating from Camel 4.5, please ensure the following

- Update your maven dependencies, changing from  `camel-langchain-embedings`to `camel-langchain4j-embedings`
- Adjust your endpoints, replacing `langchain-embedings` with `langchain4j-embedings`
- Transfer any Camel class references from `org.apache.camel.component.langchain.embeddings.LangChainEmbeddings*` to `org.apache.camel.component.langchain4j.embeddings.LangChain4jEmbeddings*`
- Modify the header name `The Finish Reason` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsFinishReason` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsFinishReason`
- Modify the header name `The Input Token Count` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsInputTokenCount` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsInputTokenCount`
- Modify the header name `The Output Token Count` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsOutputTokenCount` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsOutputTokenCount`
- Modify the header name `The Total Token Count` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsTotalTokenCount` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsTotalTokenCount`
- Modify the header name `A dense vector embedding of a text` from  `CamelLangChainEmbeddingsVector` to `CamelLangChain4jEmbeddingsVector`

=== camel-platform-http

The `PlatformHttpEngine` class has changed the `createConsumer` method to return a `org.apache.camel.component.platform.http.spi.PlatformHttpConsumer` type,
instead of `org.apache.camel.Consumer`.

=== camel-platform-http-vertx

The id used for multipart file upload attachments on `AttachmentMessage` has changed from being the name of the uploaded file, to the value specifed on the `name` field of the `Content-Disposition` header sent in the request body.

=== camel-google-sheets

The option `scopes` is changed from a `Collection` to be a `String` type to make it easy to configure in endpoint URI from all DSLs and tooling.
Multiple scopes can be separated by comma.

=== camel-kafka

The Kafka component now supports custom subscription adapters for applications with very complex subscription logic.

=== camel-azure-servicebus

The Camel Azure ServiceBus consumer has been refactored to internally use the high-level client instead of the low-level client to more easily support automatic reconnection, competing consumers and high availability, amongst other concerns. The corresponding changes to configuration options are:

- The consumer now supports the Competing Consumers EIP. This can be enabled by increasing the newly added `maxConcurrentCalls` option to a value greater than 1.
- The `disableAutoComplete` option has been removed. Auto-complete is always disabled on the underlying client to ensure that Camel is able to correctly complete, abandon or dead-letter consumed messages as appropriate. The presence of the `disableAutoComplete` option made little sense, since it is not propagated to the underlying client and enabling this option caused Camel not to take any steps to acknowledge/reject consumed messages. Enabling this option would result in message locks being held indefinitely, which is almost certainly not the desired behaviour.
- The high level client always operates in `receiveMessages` mode (peek mode is not supported), so the `consumerOperation` option has been removed, along with the `ServiceBusConsumerOperationDefinition` enum. The associated `peekNumMaxMessages` option has also been removed.
- The `receiverAsyncClient` option has been replaced with a `processorClient` option to enable use of a custom-configured client. The parameter type accepted by this option is `ServiceBusProcessorClient`.
- The `reconnectDelay` option has been removed, since reconnection is now handled internally by the client.


=== camel-yaml-dsl

Renamed `streamCaching` to `streamCache` on the `route`

Before:

[source,yaml]
----
route:
  streamCaching: false
  from:
    uri: "direct:foo"
    steps:
      - to: "mock:bar"
----

After:

[source,yaml]
----
route:
  streamCache: false
  from:
    uri: "direct:foo"
    steps:
      - to: "mock:bar"
----

=== camel-jbang

When running using `camel run --source-dir=mydir` then Camel JBang will now preload existing files on startup, such as `application.properties`,
and beans and routes (same as if you run with `cd mydir; camel run *`). This allows to configure settings on Camel on startup, which was not possible beforehand.

The `--open-api` option has changed from _code-first_ to use the new _contract-first_ Rest DSL style by using the specification file direct as-is.

=== camel-spring-boot

The auto configuration of xref:clustering.adoc[Cluster Service] implementations has been moved to dedicated starters:

[%header, cols="1,2"]
|===
| Type         | Starter
| Consul       | camel-consul-cluster-service-starter
| File         | camel-file-cluster-service-starter
| Infinispan   | camel-infinispan-cluster-service-starter
| JGroups Lock | camel-jgroups-cluster-service-starter
| JGroups Raft | camel-jgroups-raft-cluster-service-starter
| Kubernetes   | camel-kubernetes-cluster-service-starter
| Zookeeper    | camel-zookeeper-cluster-service-starter
|===


The Cluster Services are turned on by default unless they are explicit disabled, as example:

[source, properties]
----
camel.cluster.consul.enabled = false
----

=== camel-as2

Changes for AS2-MDN asynchronous delivery:

 - Added an option allowing clients to request an asynchronous receipt by including a 'Receipt-Delivery-Option' header specifying
the return URL in the request that is sent to the server.
 - Added a consumer capable of receiving signed or unsigned asynchronous message disposition notifications sent by the
message receiver confirming receipt of the message.
