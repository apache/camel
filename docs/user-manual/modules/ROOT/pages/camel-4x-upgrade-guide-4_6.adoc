= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.5 to 4.6

=== variables

When using `variableReceive` then the variable is only set if processing the `Exchange` was completely successfully.

For example calling a route that fails due to an exception being thrown (even if `onException` or `errorHandler` are in use)
then the variable is no longer set. Also, if the route is marked for rollback, or to stop continue routing with `.stop()`.

This is the same logic that the routing engine uses, whether to continue routing the `Exchange` or not.
