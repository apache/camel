= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.4 to 4.5

=== camel-core

Camel startup summary will now report total number of routes without (internal routes created by Kamelets or Rest DSL).
This ensures the total number better reflect the total number of user created routes. The summary now includes a separate
number of Kamelets and Rest DSL routes. See also the camel-kamelet section.

The following deprecated methods from the `AbstractCamelContext`, deprecated on 4.2 as part of CAMEL-19998, were finally removed:

* `setTypeConverter`
* `getOrCreateTypeConverter`
* `setManagementMBeanAssembler`
* `getRestRegistryFactory`
* `setRestRegistryFactory`
* `setTransformerRegistry`
* `setValidatorRegistry`
* `setName`
* `setDescription`
* `getBootstrapFactoryFinder`
* `getFactoryFinder`
* `addInterceptStrategy`
* `getStartupStepRecorder`
* `setStartupStepRecorder`
* `resolvePropertyPlaceholders`
* `getBasePackageScan`
* `setBasePackageScan`

Users of these methods should use the respective operations from the `ExtendedCamelContext` (accessed via `getCamelContextExtension()`),
instead.

=== Intercept EIP

The `interceptFrom` and `interceptSentToEndpoint` EIPs is now storing the intercepted endpoint using key `Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT`
as exchange property instead of a header.

Before:

[source,java]
----
String uri = exchange.getIn().getHeader(Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT, String.class);
----

After:

[source,java]
----
String uri = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT, String.class);
----

=== camel-kamelet

Routes created by Kamelets are no longer registered as JMX MBeans to avoid cluttering up with unwanted MBeans, as a Kamelet
is intended to act like a Camel component, despite its implementation is Camel routes. This means that the number of routes
listed from JMX will no longer include Kamelet routes.

The old behaviour can be enabled by setting `registerRoutesCreateByKamelet=true`
on the `ManagementAgent` object. See more in the xref:jmx.adoc[JMX] documentation.

=== camel-micrometer and camel-metrics

Due to Kamelets are changed to act more like a Camel component, and not expose internal details as JMX MBeans, then
micrometer and metrics no longer include statistics for those Kamelet routes.

The old behaviour can be enabled by setting `registerRoutesCreateByKamelet=true`
on the `ManagementAgent` object. See more in the xref:jmx.adoc[JMX] documentation.
