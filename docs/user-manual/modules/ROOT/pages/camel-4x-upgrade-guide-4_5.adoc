= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application

from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

=== Intercept EIP

The `interceptFrom` and `interceptSentToEndpoint` EIPs is now storing the intercepted endpoint using key `Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT`
as exchange property instead of a header.

Before:

[source,java]
----
String uri = exchange.getIn().getHeader(Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT, String.class);
----

After:

[source,java]
----
String uri = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT, String.class);
----
