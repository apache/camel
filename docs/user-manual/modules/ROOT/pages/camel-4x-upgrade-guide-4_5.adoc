=== Intercept EIP

The `interceptFrom` and `interceptSentToEndpoint` EIPs is now storing the intercepted endpoint using key `Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT`
as exchange property instead of a header.

Before:

[source,java]
----
String uri = exchange.getIn().getHeader(Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT, String.class);
----

After:

[source,java]
----
String uri = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.INTERCEPTED_ENDPOINT, String.class);
----
