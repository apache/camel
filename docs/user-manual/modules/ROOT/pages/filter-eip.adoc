== Filter EIP

The http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Filter.html[Message
Filter] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns]
allows you to filter messages

The following example shows how to create a Message Filter route
consuming messages from an endpoint called *queue:a*, which if the
link:predicate.html[Predicate] is true will be dispatched to *queue:b*

=== EIP options

// eip options: START
The Filter EIP has no options.
// eip options: END

=== Samples

Here is a little example in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:a")
    .filter(simple("${header.foo} == 'bar'"))
        .to("direct:b");
----

You can use many different languages as the predicate, such as XPath:
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").
        filter().xpath("/person[@name='James']").
        to("mock:result");
----

Here is another example of using a bean to define the filter behavior

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .filter().method(MyBean.class, "isGoldCustomer")
      .to("mock:gold")
    .end()
    .to("mock:all");

public static class MyBean {
    public boolean isGoldCustomer(@Header("level") String level) { 
        return level.equals("gold"); 
    }
}
----

And the example in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myBean" class="com.foo.MyBean"/>

<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:a"/>
        <filter>
            <method ref="myBean" method="isGoldCustomer"/>
            <to uri="direct:b"/>
        </filter>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----


=== Using stop

Stop is a bit different than a message filter as it will filter out all
messages and end the route entirely (filter only applies to its child
processor). Stop is convenient to use in a
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] when you for
example need to stop further processing in one of the predicates.

In the example below we do not want to route messages any further that
has the word `Bye` in the message body. Notice how we prevent this in
the when predicate by using the `.stop()`.

=== Knowing if Exchange was filtered or not

*Available as of Camel 2.5*

The link:message-filter.html[Message Filter] EIP will add a property on
the link:exchange.html[Exchange] that states if it was filtered or not.

The property has the key `Exchange.FILTER_MATCHED`, which has the String
value of `CamelFilterMatched`. Its value is a boolean indicating `true`
or `false`. If the value is `true` then the link:exchange.html[Exchange]
was routed in the filter block. This property will be visible within the
link:message-filter.html[Message Filter] block who's
link:predicate.html[Predicate] matches (value set to `true`), and to the
steps immediately following the link:message-filter.html[Message Filter]
with the value set based on the results of the last
link:message-filter.html[Message Filter] link:predicate.html[Predicate]
evaluated.
