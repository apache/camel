= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.3 to 3.4

=== camel-test and JMX

The `camel-test` module no longer has dependency on `camel-management` out of the box.
In Camel JMX is optional and to use JMX then `camel-management` must be added as dependency.

For example to use JMX during testing you the following dependency as test scope:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-management</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

=== Health Check

The default health check implementation has been moved out of `camel-base` into `camel-health` as a separate module.

=== Template components

The template components which allows access to the current `Exchange` and `CamelContext` API
from the context map available for templating has now been restricted to only the message body and headers.

This option can be enabled (`allowContextMapAll=true`) for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext.
Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API.

This applies to the following templating components: camel-freemarker, camel-velocity, camel-mvel, camel-mustache,
camel-string-template, camel-chunk, camel-robotframework.

=== Using custom language in RouteBuilder

The Java DSL `RouteBuilder` allows referring to a custom language as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .filter(language("foo", "Bla bla bla"))
      .to("mock:camel");
----

This functionality is seldom in use, as you would use the provided languages from Camel.
If using, then the `language` method now requires a static import as shown below:

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.Builder.language;
----

=== camel-spring-boot

The `/actuator/camelroutes` HTTP endpoint has been removed from provided Spring Boot actuators in `camel-spring-boot`.
This actuator was becoming problematic to maintain during Spring Boot upgrades due to changes in Spring Boot.

=== camel-servlet and camel-http-common

`HttpRegistry` and `DefaultHttpRegistry` classes from camel-servlet are moved from camel-servlet into camel-http-common.
`HttpRegistryProvider` is added and used in `DefaultHttpRegistry` instead of `CamelServlet`.

These changes had effects on camel-atmosphere-websocket and camel-servlet and also camel-resteasy.
Users of these components where they would have custom implemetations on `DefaultHttpRegistry` and using `CamelServlet` class should take this change into account.

=== camel-sql

The `JdbcAggregationRepository` optimistic locking feature has been fixed to work on a distributed environment and every database.
There is a new `version` column that is required and must be added to the repository:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE aggregation (
 id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 exchange blob NOT NULL,
 version BIGINT NOT NULL,
 constraint aggregation_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE aggregation_completed (
 id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 exchange blob NOT NULL,
 version BIGINT NOT NULL,
 constraint aggregation_completed_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
----

=== Maven Archetypes

The `camel-archetype-java8` has been removed, as you can just use `camel-archetype-java` instead.

=== Camel-Kafka

From a lot of time, the headerFilterStrategy application in consumer and producer was done in an interchanged way. You need to have a look at the following issue for more information: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-15121
