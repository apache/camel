= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.3 to 3.4

=== camel-test and JMX

The `camel-test` module no longer has dependency on `camel-management` out of the box.
In Camel JMX is optional and to use JMX then `camel-management` must be added as depencency.

So for users that do not use JMX then `camel-test` will not include JMX out of the box anymore.

=== Template components

The template components which allows access to the current `Exchange` and `CamelContext` API
from the context map available for templating has now been restricted to only the message body and headers.

This option can be enabled (`allowContextMapAll=true`) for full access to the current Exchange and CamelContext.
Doing so impose a potential security risk as this opens access to the full power of CamelContext API.

This applies to the following templating components: camel-freemarker, camel-velocity, camel-mvel, camel-mustache,
camel-string-template, camel-chunk, camel-robotframework.

=== Using custom language in RouteBuilder

The Java DSL `RouteBuilder` allows referring to a custom language as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .filter(language("foo", "Bla bla bla"))
      .to("mock:camel");
----

This functionality is seldom in use, as you would use the provided languages from Camel.
If using, then the `language` method now requires a static import as shown below:

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.Builder.language;
----
