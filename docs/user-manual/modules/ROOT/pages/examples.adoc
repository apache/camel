= Examples

Once you have read about xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] and
looked at the xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns], you might want to try out some examples.

Before starting to work on example you may want to
xref:faq/what-are-the-dependencies.adoc[check the requirements for working
with Camel]. Then xref:running-examples.adoc[Running Examples] describes
how to get the examples to run

== Walk-throughs

* Walk through the code of a
xref:walk-through-an-example.adoc[beginner's example] so you can
understand how things fit together using the Java xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] to
set up some routes in a simple `main(...)` method.
* Walk through the xref:walk-through-another-example.adoc[Spring DSL
example] to look at XML-based routing.
* Walk through the xref:console-example.adoc[Console Example] to
practice reading input from the console.

[NOTE]
====
The examples listed below are hosted at Apache. We also offer the
link:../../community/articles/[Articles] page as a collection of 3rd-party Camel
material - such as tutorials, blog posts, published articles, videos,
podcasts, presentations, and so forth.

If you have written a Camel-related article, then we are happy to
provide a link to it. You can contact the Camel xref:team.adoc[Team] via
our xref:mailing-lists.adoc[Mailing Lists], or simply post a tweet with
the words "Apache Camel".
