Once you have read about xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] and
looked at the xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns], you might want to try out some examples.

[NOTE]
====
The examples listed below are hosted at Apache. We also offer the
link:/community/articles/[Articles] page as a collection of 3rd-party Camel
material - such as tutorials, blog posts, published articles, videos,
podcasts, presentations, and so forth.

If you have written a Camel-related article, then we are happy to
provide a link to it. You can contact the Camel link:/community/team/[Team] via
our link:/community/mailing-list/[Mailing Lists], or simply post a tweet with
the words "Apache Camel".
