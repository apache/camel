= Pluggable Class Resolvers

Camel provides pluggable class resolvers allowing third party platforms
and containers to provide their own resolvers in case the default ones
would not fit.

When running Camel on platforms such as Spring Boot, Quarkus, or Apache Karaf,
then Camel uses platform specific resolvers to support classloading in these runtimes.

== Configuration of a custom class resolver

To instruct Camel to use your own custom class resolver, you set the
resolver on the `CamelContext` using the appropriate setters;
or register a custom resolver in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] then Camel
will automatically detect this during startup.

=== SPI providers

Platform providers should look in the `org.apache.camel.spi` package for
the pluggable resolvers, such as:

* `ClassResolver`
* `FactoryFinderResolver`
* `PackageScanClassResolver`
* `PackageScanResourceResolver`
* `ResourceResolver`
