= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.9 to 4.10

=== camel-jgroups

The cluster lock has been removed as it has been removed in JGroups 5.4 onwards, and it was
not recommended to be used in older JGroups releases. You can use another Camel component such as
`camel-infinispan` that has cluster locking.

The `camel-jgroups-cluster-service-starter` in Camel Spring Boot has been removed.
