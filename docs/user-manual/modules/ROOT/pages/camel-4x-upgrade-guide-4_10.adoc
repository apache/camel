= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.9 to 4.10

=== camel-jgroups

The cluster lock has been removed as it has been removed in JGroups 5.4 onwards, and it was
not recommended to be used in older JGroups releases. You can use another Camel component such as
`camel-infinispan` that has cluster locking.

The `camel-jgroups-cluster-service-starter` in Camel Spring Boot has been removed.

=== camel-jbang

The camel-jbang commands for `camel-k` has been removed.


=== camel-google-pubsub-lite

The component `camel-google-pubsub-lite` has been deprecated following the deprecation of the corresponding service by Google Cloud Platform. 

Google recommends migrating your Pub/Sub Lite service to either Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka or Google Cloud Pub/Sub. Depending on your choice, you should use `camel-kafka` or `camel-google-pubsub component`, respectively.
