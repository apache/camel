= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.11 to 3.12

=== API changes

The methods `getComponentNames` and `getLanguageNames` on `CamelContext` have been changed to
return `Set<String>` instead of `List<String>`.

Added `getExchangePattern` to `Endpoint` which is a method that already exists on `DefaultEndpoint`.
However the method is needed to be exposed in the API as well.

The `ThroughputLogger` has changed the return type from `int` to `long` in the `getReceivedCounter` method.

Removed the `dataSonnet(Expression)` methods from `RouteBuilder` as they should not be used;
use the methods that take `String` as type.

=== Data Formats

We had to fix all the data-formats options that take a Java classname to support
using the `.class` type in Java vs using a string value in XML/YAML.

This means the following options have been renamed:

- `camel-asn1` renamed `clazzName` to `unmarshalType`
- `camel-avro` renamed `collectionTypeName` to `collectionType`, and `jsonViewTypeName` to `jsonView`, and `unmarshalTypeName` to `unmarshalType`
- `camel-cbor` renamed `collectionTypeName` to `collectionType`, and `unmarshalTypeName` to `unmarshalType`
- `camel-jacksonxml` renamed `collectionTypeName` to `collectionType`, and `jsonViewTypeName` to `jsonView`, and `unmarshalTypeName` to `unmarshalType`
- `camel-json` renamed `collectionTypeName` to `collectionType`, and `jsonViewTypeName` to `jsonView`, and `unmarshalTypeName` to `unmarshalType`
- `camel-protobuf` renamed `collectionTypeName` to `collectionType`, and `jsonViewTypeName` to `jsonView`, and `unmarshalTypeName` to `unmarshalType`
- `camel-yaml` renamed `unmarshalTypeName` to `unmarshalType`

=== Rest DSL

The `clientRequestValidation` now includes one more check:

- Parsing error of the message body (JSon, XML or Auto binding mode must be enabled). (Returns HTTP Status 400)


=== camel-aws2-ddb

The `iteratorType` option has been dropped in favour of the `streamIteratorType` option. Possible values are `FROM_LATEST` and `FROM_START`.

The `sequencenumberprovider` functionality is no longer supported.

=== camel-catalog

Remove the APIs to return the website documentation in ascii doc and html format, it is the methods
with naming pattern `...AsciiDoc` and `...HtmlDoc`.

=== camel-cdi

The XML DSL with `camel-cdi` has removed the deprecated `<proxy>` functionality.

=== camel-http-common

The method `org.apache.camel.http.common.HttpHelper.readResponseBodyFromInputStream` is renamed to `cacheResponseBodyFromInputStream`,
because it must cache the response body as it is used with the `PollingConsumer` in `camel-http`,
that otherwise may fail if the original `InputStream` is closed by the underlying HTTP client.

=== camel-jms

The `camel-jms` component now better support Apache Artemis in streaming mode for large messages support,
when Artemis is using a pooled connection pool (previously pooled was not supported). Now the option `artemisStreamingEnabled`
must explicit be set to `true` to enable support for Artemis streaming mode. Previously Camel tried to auto-detect this.

=== camel-google-sheets

The `google-sheets-stream` component has changed the syntax, from: `google-sheets-stream:apiName` to: `google-sheets-stream:spreadsheetId`

The old `apiName` option was not in use, and therefore it has been replaced with `spreadsheetId`
which used to be query parameter.

=== camel-kamelet / route templates

Kamelet parameters that are named such as `host`, `port` are now always used with their configured value.
Before the value in use may have been from an ENV variable with the same name.

=== camel-kafka

The `camel-kafka` component was refactored to avoid blocking API calls in the Kafka consumer. As part of the refactoring the configuration `consumerStreams` was removed. In previous versions this setting configured the size thread pool used by the component to create Kafka consumers. As of 3.12, the size of the thread pool is set to be the same as the number of concurrent consumers (set by `consumersCount`).

=== camel-spark

The `camel-spark` component has been upgraded from Spark 2.x to 3.x.

=== camel-influxdb

The `camel-influxdb` won't autocreate the database if not present anymore.
With CAMEL-16892 we introduced the checkDatabaseExistence and autoCreateDatabase options for this purpose. 
Both of the options are false by default. So, you'll need to set both to true if you want to have the older releases' behavior, or create the database yourself before using the camel component.

=== camel-huawei

All Huawei Cloud components use AK/SK as security keys to authenticate against the hauwei cloud backend services. Initally AK was mapped to authenticationKey in the endpoint class. To be in-line with Huawei Cloud's naming conventions, we have renamed this option from `authenticationKey` to `accessKey` for all components. This is a breaking change for users who are already using huawei cloud components until version 3.11.x. 

=== camel-spring-cloud-*-starter

The deprecated camel-spring-boot cloud-starter components camel-spring-cloud-starter, camel-spring-cloud-consul-starter, camel-spring-cloud-netflix-starter and camel-spring-cloud-zookeeper-starter have been removed.
