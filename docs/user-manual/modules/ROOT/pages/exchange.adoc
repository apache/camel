= Message Exchange

To support various message exchange patterns
like one way Event Message and
Request Reply messages Camel uses an Exchange
interface which has a *pattern* property which can be set to *InOnly*
for an Event Message which has a single inbound
Message, or *InOut* for a
Request Reply where there is an inbound and
outbound Message.
