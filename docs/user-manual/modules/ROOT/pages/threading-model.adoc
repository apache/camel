= Threading Model

The threading model in Camel is based on a pluggable reactive routing engine,
and thread pools from the JDK concurrency API.

This page focuses on thread pools.
Camel leverages thread pools in several places such as:

* Several xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP] patterns support using thread pools for
concurrency
* xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] component for asynchronous connectivity
* xref:components:eips:threads-eip.adoc[Threads] EIP in Camel routes
* Some components use thread pools out of the box, such as
xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] or xref:components::jetty-component.adoc[Jetty]

== Thread pool profiles

By default, when a thread pool is to be created by Camel, then the pool configuration
is based upon a profile, the _default thread pool profile_

The default profile is pre-configured out of the box with the following settings:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
| Option | Default | Description
| *poolSize* | `10` | Sets the default core pool size (threads to keep minimum in pool)
| *keepAliveTime* | `60` | Sets the default keep alive time (in seconds) for inactive threads
| *maxPoolSize* | `20` | Sets the default maximum pool size
| *maxQueueSize* | `1000` | Sets the default maximum number of tasks in the work queue. Use -1 for an unbounded queue.
| *allowCoreThreadTimeOut* | `true` | Sets default whether to allow core threads to timeout
| *rejectedPolicy* | `CallerRuns` | Sets the default handler for tasks which cannot be executed by the thread pool. Has four options:
`Abort, CallerRuns, Discard, DiscardOldest` which corresponds to the same four options provided out of the box in the JDK.
|===

What that means is that for example when you use
xref:components:eips:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] with `parallelProcessing=true` enabled,
then it would create a thread pool based on the profile above.

You can define as many thread pool profiles as you like. But there must
be only *one* default profile. A custom thread pool profile will inherit
from the default profile. Which means that any option you do not
explicit define will fallback and use the option from the default
profile.

=== Configuring default thread pool profile

In Spring XML you can configure thread pool profile with `threadPoolProfile` as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<threadPoolProfile id="defaultThreadPoolProfile"
    defaultProfile="true"
    poolSize="5"
    maxPoolSize="10"/>
----

And in Java DSL

[source,java]
----
ThreadPoolProfile profile = camelContext.getExecutorServiceManager().getDefaultThreadPoolProfile();
profile.setPoolSize(5);
profile.setMaxPoolSize(10);
----

And with camel-main, Spring Boot or Quarkus you can configure this in the `application.properties|yaml` file:

[source,properties]
----
## configure default thread pool profile
camel.threadpool.pool-size = 5
camel.threadpool.max-pool-size = 5
----


=== Using thread pool profiles

Suppose you want to use a custom thread pool profile for a Multicast EIP
pattern in a Camel route you can do it using the `executorServiceRef`
attribute as shown in Spring XML:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext>

    <threadPoolProfile id="fooProfile"
                       poolSize="20" maxPoolSize="50" maxQueueSize="-1"/>

    <route>
       <multicast aggregationStrategy="myStrategy" executorServiceRef="fooProfile">
          ...
       </multicast>
    </route>
</camelContext>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Camel will do at runtime is to lookup in the
xref:registry.adoc[Registry] for a `ExecutorService` with the id `fooProfile`.
If none found it will fallback and see if there is a
`ThreadPoolProfile` defined with that id. In this example there is a profile,
so the profile is used as base settings for creating a new `ExecutorService` which is
handed back to the xref:components:eips:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] EIP to use in the
Camel route.

In Java DSL you can use `ThreadPoolProfileBuilder` to create a profile and then register the profile:

[source,java]
----
ThreadPoolProfileBuilder builder = new ThreadPoolProfileBuilder("fooProfile");
builder.poolSize(20).maxPoolSize(50).maxQueueSize(-1);

camelContext.getExecutorServiceManager().registerThreadPoolProfile(builder.build());
----

== Creating custom thread pools

You can also use the `<threadPool>` tag in Spring XML to create a
specific thread pool (`ExecutorService`). Notice that any options you
do not explicit define, will have Camel to use the default thread pool
profile as fallback. For example if you omit setting the `maxQueueSize`
then Camel will fallback and use the value from the default thread pool
profiles, which by default is `1000`.

== Customizing thread names

On the `ExecutorServiceManager` you can
configure the thread name pattern using the `setThreadNamePattern`
method, which defines the thread names used when a thread pool creates a
thread.

The default pattern is:

[source,text]
----
Camel (#camelId#) thread ##counter# - #name#
----

In the pattern you can use the following placeholders

* `\#camelId#` - The xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] name
* `\#counter#` An unique incrementing counter
* `\#name#` - The thread name
* `\#longName#` - The long thread name which can include endpoint parameters etc.

In Spring XML the pattern can be set with `threadNamePattern` attribute as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext threadNamePattern="Riding the thread #counter#">
  <route>
    <from uri="seda:start"/>
    <to uri="log:result"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

In Java DSL you can set the pattern as follows:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext camel = ...
camel.getExecutorServiceManager().setThreadNamePattern("Riding the thread #counter#")
----

And with camel-main, Spring Boot or Quarkus you can configure this in the `application.properties|yaml` file:

[source,properties]
----
## camel-main or quarkus
camel.main.thread-name-pattern = Riding the thread #counter#

## spring boot
camel.springboot.thread-name-pattern = Riding the thread #counter#
----

== Shutting down thread pools

All thread pools created by Camel will be properly shutdown when
`CamelContext` shutdowns which ensures no leaks in the pools in case you
run in a server environment with hot deployments and the likes.

The `ExecutorServiceManager` has APIs for shutting down thread pools
gracefully and aggressively. It is encouraged to use this API for creating
and shutting down thread pools.

The method `shutdownGraceful(executorService)` from `ExecutorServiceManager`
will shutdown graceful at first, until a timeout value is hit. After
that it shuts down aggressively, again using the timeout value to wait for
the operation to complete. This means you can wait at most 2 x timeout
for shutting down the thread pool.

The timeout value is by default `10000` millis. You can configure a
custom value on the `ExecutorServiceManager` if needed. During shutdown
Camel will log every 2 seconds at INFO level progress of shutting down
the thread pool. For example in case a shutdown takes a while, then
there is activity in the logs.

The APIs on `ExecutorServiceManager` that is related to shutting down a
thread pool is as follows:

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description
|shutdown |Marks the thread pool as shutdown
(like calling the `ExecutorService.shutdown()` method).
|shutdownNow |Forces the thread pool to shut down now
(like calling the `ExecutorService.shutdownNow()` method).
|shutdownGraceful |Marks the thread pool as shutdown, and graceful shutdown
the pool, by waiting for tasks to complete. A default timeout value of
10 sec is used, before shutdown becomes aggressive using `shutdownNow`,
forcing threads to shut down quicker.
|shutdownGraceful(timeout) |As shutdownGraceful but with custom timeout value
|awaitTermination |To wait graceful for the termination of a thread pool (eg
to wait for its tasks to complete). Will wait until all tasks are completed or timed out.
|===

== JMX Management

All the thread pools that Camel creates are managed and thus you can see
them in JXM under the `threadpools` tree.

NOTE: This requires to enabled JMX by including `camel-management` JAR in the classpath.

== Component developers

If you develop your own Camel component and are in need of a thread
pool, then its advised to use the
`ExecutorServiceStrategy`/`ExecutorServiceManager` to create the thread
pool you need.

=== ExecutorServiceStrategy

Camel provides a pluggable strategy to hook in your own thread pool
provider, for example from a WorkManager in a J2EE server etc. +
See the `org.apache.camel.spi.ExecutorServiceStrategy` interface which
you should implement and hook into the WorkManager.

=== ExecutorServiceManager

To hook in custom thread pool providers (e.g. for J2EE servers) a
`ThreadPoolFactory` interface can be implemented. The implementation can
be set in the `ExecutorServiceManager`.

== Virtual Threads

Starting from Java 21, the default `ThreadPoolFactory` can build `ExecutorService` and `ScheduledExecutorService` that
use https://openjdk.org/jeps/425[virtual threads] instead of platform threads.
But as it is an experimental feature, it is not enabled by default, you need to set the System property `camel.threads.virtual.enabled`
to `true` and run Camel using Java 21 or above to enable it.

Be aware that even if it is enabled, there are some use cases where platform threads are still used, for example, if the
thread factory is configured to create non-daemon threads since virtual threads can only be daemons, or when the
`ExecutorService` or `ScheduledExecutorService` to build cannot have more than one thread or finally when `corePoolSize`
is set to zero and `maxQueueSize` is set to a value less or equal to `0`.
