= Java DSL

Apache Camel offers a Java based DSL.

In the Java DSL you create a route by extending the xref:manual::route-builder.adoc[`RouteBuilder` class], and implementing the `configure` method.

== Java DSL example

This is best illustrate by an example. In the code below we create a new
class called `MyRouteBuilder` that extends the
`org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder` from Camel.

In the `configure` method the Java DSL is at our disposal.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

/**
 * A Camel Java DSL Router
 */
public class MyRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

    /**
     * Let's configure the Camel routing rules using Java code...
     */
    public void configure() {

        // here is a sample which processes the input files
        // (leaving them in place - see the 'noop' flag)
        // then performs content based routing on the message using XPath
        from("file:src/data?noop=true")
            .choice()
                .when(xpath("/person/city = 'London'"))
                    .to("file:target/messages/uk")
                .otherwise()
                    .to("file:target/messages/others");
    }

}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the `configure` method we can define Camel xref:routes.adoc[Routes].

In the example above we have a single route, which pickup files (the `from`).

[source,java]
---------------------------------------
from("file:src/data?noop=true")
---------------------------------------

Then we use the xref:components:eips:choice-eip.adoc[Content Based Router] EIP
(the `choice`) to route the message whether the person is from London or not.

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------
.choice()
    .when(xpath("/person/city = 'London'"))
        .to("file:target/messages/uk")
    .otherwise()
        .to("file:target/messages/others");
-------------------------------------------------------

=== Routes using Java lambda style

Camel now supports to define Camel routes in Java DSL using Lambda style. This can be beneficial for microservices or serverless where
you may want to quickly define a few routes.

For example using lambda style you can define a Camel route that takes messages from Kafka and send to JMS in a single line of code:

[source,java]
----
rb -> rb.from("kafka:cheese").to("jms:queue:foo");
----

There is a bit more to this as the lambda route must be coded in a Java method that returns an instance of `LambdaRouteBuilder`.
See more at the xref:lambda-route-builder.adoc[LambdaRouteBuilder] documentation.


== More Details

For more details see xref:dsl.adoc[DSL], xref:routes.adoc[Routes], and xref:processor.adoc[Processor].

=== The Java DSL under the hood

As mentioned in the Getting Started guide, you can use Camel's Java DSL in a way that almost looks like a DSL. For instance:

*Note*: comments afterwards explain some of the constructs used in the example.

.*Example of Camel's "Java DSL"*
[source,java]
----
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
        from("queue:a").filter(header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")).to("queue:b");

        from("queue:c").choice()
                .when(header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")).to("queue:d")
                .when(header("foo").isEqualTo("cheese")).to("queue:e")
                .otherwise().to("queue:f");
    }
};
CamelContext myCamelContext = new DefaultCamelContext();
myCamelContext.addRoutes(builder);
----

The first line in the above example creates an object which is an instance of an anonymous subclass of `RouteBuilder` with the specified `configure()` method.

The `CamelContext.addRoutes(RouterBuilder builder)` method invokes `builder.setContext(this)` – so the `RouteBuilder` object knows which `CamelContext` object it is associated with – and then invokes `builder.configure()`. The body of `configure()` invokes methods such as `from()`, `filter()`, `choice()`, `when()`, `isEqualTo()`, `otherwise()` and `to()`.

The `RouteBuilder.from(String uri)` method invokes `getEndpoint(uri)` on the `CamelContext` associated with the `RouteBuilder` object to get the specified `Endpoint` and then puts a `FromBuilder` _wrapper_ around this `Endpoint`. The `FromBuilder.filter(Predicate predicate)` method creates a `FilterProcessor` object for the `Predicate` (that is, condition) object built from the `header("foo").isEqualTo("bar")` expression. In this way, these operations incrementally build up a `Route` object (with a `RouteBuilder` wrapper around it) and add it to the `CamelContext` instance associated with the `RouteBuilder`.
