= Building Camel from Source

Camel uses http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] as its build and management
tool. If you don't fancy using Maven you can use your IDE directly or
Download a distribution or JAR.

== Prerequisites

* Java 11

* https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[Maven Wrapper] can be used and are bundled.

* Otherwise, http://maven.apache.org/download.html[download and install Maven]
** Maven 3.8.x or newer is required to build Camel 3 onwards

* Get the latest source from https://github.com/apache/camel/[Github]

== Maven options

To build Camel maven has to be configured to use more memory, which is done automatically via
the `.mvn/jvm.config` file.

== A normal build

Beware this runs all the unit tests which takes many hours.

[source,bash]
-----------------
mvn clean install
-----------------

== A quick build without running tests

The following skips building the manual, the distro and does not execute
the unit tests, which can complete in less than 10 minutes.

[source,bash]
-------------------------------
mvn clean install -Pfastinstall
-------------------------------

== A normal build without running tests but auto formatting and checkstyle verification enabled

[source,bash]
-------------------------------------------
mvn clean install -Pfastinstall,format,sourcecheck
-------------------------------------------

== Building with checkstyle

To enable source style checking with checkstyle, build Camel with the
`-Psourcecheck` parameter

[source,bash]
-------------------------------
mvn clean install -Psourcecheck 
-------------------------------

== Building source jars

If you want to build jar files with the source code, that for instance
Eclipse can important, so you can debug the Camel code as well. Then you
can run this command from the camel root folder:

[source,bash]
------------------------------------------
mvn clean source:jar install -Pfastinstall
------------------------------------------
