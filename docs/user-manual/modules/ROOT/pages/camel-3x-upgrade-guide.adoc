= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is intended for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y.

IMPORTANT: If you are migrating from Camel 2.x then use the
xref:camel-3-migration-guide.adoc[Camel 2.x to 3.0 Migration Guide].

For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.1

=== camel-ahc, camel-netty-http, camel-undertow

These Camel components now no longer have dependency on Javax Servlet.

=== camel-undertow

The exception class `HttpOperationFailedException` is now from package `org.apache.camel.http.base` instead of `org.apache.camel.http.common`.
The Camel undertow producer throws this exception.

=== came-bean

The bean component has been changed to behave as singleton scoped by default.
This means that the bean is created or looked up once and reused.

The option `cache` has been deprecated in favour of the new `scope` option that by default is `Singleton`. You can set this to `Prototype` to use the old behaviour.

NOTE: Setting this to Prototype will let Camel create/lookup a new bean instance, per use; which acts as prototype scoped. However beware that if you lookup the bean, then the registry that holds the bean, would return a bean accordingly to its configuration, which can be singleton or prototype scoped. For example if you use Spring, or CDI, which has their own settings for setting bean scopes.

=== camel-irc

The `camel-irc` component has changed its endpoint syntax and removed option #room as a part of the url path. Allowed syntax is:

[source,text]
----
irc:nick@host[:port]?[options]
----

=== camel-nats

The `camel-nats` component has changed its endpoint syntax from `nats:servers` to `nats:topic`.
For example before

[source,text]
----
nats:myserver:4222?topic=myTopic
----

Should be changed to
----
nats:myTopic?servers=myserver:4222
----

This change is motivated by allowing to configure servers on component level,
and also for Spring Boot auto-configuration etc.

=== camel-nsq

The `camel-nsq` component has changed its endpoint syntax from `nsq:servers` to `nsq:topic`.
For example before

[source,text]
----
nsq:myserver:4161/myTopic
----

Should be changed to
----
nsq:myTopic?servers=myserver:4161
----

This change is motivated by allowing to configure servers on component level,
and also for Spring Boot auto-configuration etc.

=== camel-ipfs

The `camel-ipfs` component has changed its endpoint syntax from `nsq:host:port/command` to `ipfs:command`.
The host and port is now configured on the component level instead.

For example before

[source,text]
----
ipfs:127.0.0.1:5001/add
----

Should be changed to
----
ipfs:add
----

=== Graceful Shutdown Timeout

When shutting down Camel, then the default timeout has changed from 300 seconds (5 minutes) to 45 seconds.
The 45 seconds was chosen as 30 seconds is a common timeout to use for remote protocols, so we wanted to give
Camel a bit more time, and hence added 15 seconds so the default is 45 seconds.

=== Message History

The message history is now default disabled (due to optimize core for lower footprint out of the box).
See the xref:message-history.adoc[Message History] documentation for how to enabled message history.

=== API changes

==== Exchange

The `Exchange` API has been modified slightly as part of an optimization effort.
The returned value of `getCreated` is changed from `java.util.Date` to `long` which is the time millis.
The `Exchange.CREATED_TIMESTAMP` is no longer stored as exchange property, but you should use the `getCreated` method on `Exchange`.
The returned value of `isExternalRedelivered` is changed from `Boolean` to `boolean`.

Some of the advanced and API for component developers on `Exchange` has been moved to an extended interface `ExtendedExchange`.
The following methods has been moved:

- setFromEndpoint
- setFromRouteId
- setUnitOfWork
- addOnCompletion
- containsOnCompletion
- handoverCompletions

You can use these methods by adapting to the extended exchange as shown below:

[source,java]
----
exchange.adapt(ExtendedExchange.class).addOnCompletion(...);
----

==== Cookies

Cookies from `camel-http-common` has been moved into a new `camel-http-base` JAR.
The package `org.apache.camel.http.common.cookie` is renamed to `org.apache.camel.http.base.cookie`.

==== Java DSL

The Java DSL has been revisited and the following methods have been removed:

* ExpressionClause::body(Supplier<Object>)
* MulticastDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)
* ProcessorDefinition::process(Supplier<Processor>)
* ProcessorDefinition::setBody(Supplier<Result>)
* RecipientListDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)
* SplitDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)
* WireTapDefinition::newExchange(Supplier<Processor>)
* WireTapDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)

This change is motivated by the need to remove method ambiguity for untyped languages such as Groovy and JavaScript, for more info see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-14300

==== CamelContext

Some unused methods have been removed from `CamelContext` which were not part of the public API. The following methods have been removed:

* getProducerServicePool
* setProducerServicePool
* getPollingConsumerServicePool
* setPollingConsumerServicePool
