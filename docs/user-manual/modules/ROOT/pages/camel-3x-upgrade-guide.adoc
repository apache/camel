= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is intended for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y.

IMPORTANT: If you are migrating from Camel 2.x then use the
xref:camel-3-migration-guide.adoc[Camel 2.x to 3.0 Migration Guide].

For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.1

=== camel-nats

The `camel-nats` component has changed its endpoint syntax from `nats:servers` to `nats:topic`.
For example before

[source,text]
----
nats:myserver:4222?topic=myTopic
----

Should be changed to
----
nats:myTopic?servers=myserver:4222
----

This change is motivated by allowing to configure servers on component level,
and also for Spring Boot auto-configuration etc.

=== camel-nsq

The `camel-nsq` component has changed its endpoint syntax from `nsq:servers` to `nsq:topic`.
For example before

[source,text]
----
nsq:myserver:4161/myTopic
----

Should be changed to
----
nsq:myTopic?servers=myserver:4161
----

This change is motivated by allowing to configure servers on component level,
and also for Spring Boot auto-configuration etc.


=== Java DSL

The Java DSL has been revisited and the following methods have been removed:

* ExpressionClause::body(Supplier<Object>)
* MulticastDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)
* ProcessorDefinition::process(Supplier<Processor>)
* ProcessorDefinition::setBody(Supplier<Result>)
* RecipientListDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)
* SplitDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)
* WireTapDefinition::newExchange(Supplier<Processor>)
* WireTapDefinition::onPrepare(Supplier<Processor>)

This change is motivated by the need to remove method ambiguity for untyped languages such as Groovy and JavaScript, for more info see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-14300
