= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.13 to 3.14

=== API changes

Added method `updateRoutesToCamelContext` to `org.apache.camel.RoutesBuilder` interface.

Added parameter `Resource` in `createRoute` method on `org.apache.camel.spi.RouteFactory`.

Added method `reloadProperties` to `org.apache.camel.spi.LoadablePropertiesSource`.

Removed the deprecated `headerName` option from RemoveHeader EIP. Use `name` instead.

=== camel-kafka

The APIs in `camel-kafka` component changed from using the Kafka Client classes `org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer` and `org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer`
to their interfaces `org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Producer` and `org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer` instead.

The option `KafkaManualCommitFactory` on component is now autowired, if there exists a single
custom factory in the registry.

=== camel-jbang

The option `debug-level` has been renamed to `logging-level` because the option is for configuring the logging level.

=== camel-zookeeper/camel-master

When using Zookeeper with the Master component, the given namespace is now used to define leadership. In other words, a route defined with `master:lock1` will result in one leader election, while a route defined with `master:lock2` will result in a separate leader election, which may or may not result in the same leader as `lock1`. This matches the existing behavior of the Master component when using Consul.

=== camel-aws2-ses

The to and replyTo parameters are now comma separated String and no more List of Strings, this is true even for the related headers.
