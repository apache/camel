= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.13 to 3.14

=== API changes

Added method `updateRoutesToCamelContext` to `org.apache.camel.RoutesBuilder` interface.

=== camel-jbang

The option `debug-level` has been renamed to `logging-level` because the option is for configuring the logging level.

=== camel-zookeeper/camel-master

When using Zookeeper with the Master component, the given namespace is now used to define leadership. In other words, a route defined with `master:lock1` will result in one leader election, while a route defined with `master:lock2` will result in a separate leader election, which may or may not result in the same leader as `lock1`. This matches the existing behavior of the Master component when using Consul.
