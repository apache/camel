= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.12 to 3.13

=== API changes

Added method `getStartedEventNotifiers` to `org.apache.camel.spi.ManagementStrategy`.

Added method `scheduleQueue` to `org.apache.camel.spi.ReactiveExecutor`.

The `org.apache.camel.support.ObjectHelper#createIterable` now supports `java.util.Map` returning
an `Iterable<Map.Entry>` iterating each row in the map.

The `org.apache.camel.spi.RestApiProcessorFactory` has removed
the following two parameters (`String contextIdPattern, boolean contextIdListing`)
from the `createApiProcessor` method.

=== Split EIP

The Split EIP now supports splitting message bodies that are of type `java.util.Map`, which
now splits that into a `Set<Map.Entry>` - eg a set of each map entry as key/value pairs.

=== SimpleBuilder

The `org.apache.camel.builder.SimpleBuilder` has been deprecated. This builder
was mostly used internally in Camel with the Java DSL in some situations.

End users that may use `SimpleBuilder` in Camel Java DSL can migrate from:

[source,java]
----
simple("1").resultType(Integer.class))
----

to

[source,java]
----
simple("1", Integer.class)
----

=== CamelContextInitializing and CamelContextInitialized events

These two events are fired during bootstrap of `CamelContext` even if a custom `EventNotifier`
may not have been fully started. This is due to that these events happen very early in the
bootstrap process, but are of importance for event notifiers to be able to react upon.

=== Using custom Debugger

Previously when setting a custom `org.apache.camel.spi.Debugger`, then Camel would automatically
enable debug mode. Now debugging must be enabled by setting `setDebugging(true)` on `CamelContext`.

=== Using Transactions

The routing engine has been changed to route exchanges in a different order
when using transactions (`.transacted()`). When an `Exchange` is continued
routed a task is scheduled to the `ReactiveExecutor`. This fixed issues
with could lead to `StackOverflowException`.

=== camel-couchdb

The `since` configuration was replaced by the `resumeStrategy`. Integrations can now manage the last update sequence for tracking the changes directly. Check the samples section on the component documentation page for a sample.

=== camel-file

In order to reduce memory pressure, the component was modified to avoid using Lists for certain file operations (CAMEL-17059). This affected the APIs of some the APIs and interfaces provided by the component.

- `GenericFileOperations`: the return type for the methods `listFiles` and `listFiles(String)` was modified to return an array of (generic) objects instead of a List
- `GenericFileConsumer`: the signature of the methods `isValidFile` and `isMatched` was modified to receive an array of files.

=== camel-ftp

The `FtpConsumer`, `FtpOperations`, `SftConsumer` and `SftpOperations` classes were modified to comply with the API changes on the `camel-file` component.

=== camel-hazelcast-starter

The `camel-hazelcast-starter` for Spring Boot no longer has _customer_ auto configuration options for all its components

eg the following configuration keys have been removed

- `...customizer.hazelcast-instance.enabled`
- `...customizer.hazelcast-instance.override`

Any Camel component can be customized by using the `org.apache.camel.spi.ComponentCustomizer` SPI.

=== camel-jsch

The `ScpOperations` class were modified to comply with the API changes on the `camel-file` component.

=== camel-kafka

The `KafkaManualCommit` class were modified in order to support async manual commit. Please use the new function `commit()` instead of the old deprecated one `commitSync()`.

=== camel-mllp

This component has been refactored to be similar to other Camel components.
The old component had an unusual static configuration of the `MllpComponent` which now is
refactored to be Camel standard with regular getter/setters. The component is now also
configured _reflection free_. We also cleaned up how the component dealt with which charset
to use when processing HL7 messages. Users using `camel-mllp` is recommended to test
their applications when upgrading to ensure this continues to work.

=== camel-openapi-java / camel-swagger-java

When using Rest DSL and the `restConfiguration` has a `contextPath` configured, then this value
is used as leading base path for all API services that are in the generated api-docs.

This is i.e. needed when using `camel-servlet` which runs under a specific `context-path`.

Support for rendering api docs by discovering other CamelContext via JMX in the same JVM has been removed.
Rendering of api docs is now only supported for the same CamelContext.

=== camel-quartz

The `fireNow` parameter was removed because have no effect.
The `triggerStartDelay` parameter supports negative value to shift trigger start time in the past. It allows to fire the trigger immediately by configured `MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_FIRE_ONCE_NOW`.
