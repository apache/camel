= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.12 to 3.13

=== API changes

Added method `getStartedEventNotifiers` to `org.apache.camel.spi.ManagementStrategy`.

Added method `scheduleQueue` to `org.apache.camel.spi.ReactiveExecutor`.

=== SimpleBuilder

The `org.apache.camel.builder.SimpleBuilder` has been deprecated. This builder
was mostly used internally in Camel with the Java DSL in some situations.

End users that may use `SimpleBuilder` in Camel Java DSL can migrate from:

[source,java]
----
simple("1").resultType(Integer.class))
----

to

[source,java]
----
simple("1", Integer.class)
----

=== Using custom Debugger

Previously when setting a custom org.apache.camel.spi.Debugger, then Camel would automatically
enable debug mode. Now debugging must be enabled by setting `setDebugging(true)` on `CamelContext`.

=== Using transactions

The routing engine has been changed to route exchanges in a different order
when using transactions (`.transacted()`). When an `Exchange` is continued
routed a task is scheduled to the `ReactiveExecutor`. This fixed issues
with could lead to `StackOverflowException`.

=== camel-hazelcast-starter

The `camel-hazelcast-starter` for Spring Boot no longer has _customer_ auto configuration options for all its components

eg the following configuration keys have been removed

- ...customizer.hazelcast-instance.enabled
- ...customizer.hazelcast-instance.override

Any Camel component can be customized by using the `org.apache.camel.spi.ComponentCustomizer` SPI.

=== camel-openapi-java

When using Rest DSL and the `restConfiguration` has a `contextPath` configured, then this value
is used as leading base path for all API services that are in the generated api-docs.

This is i.e. needed when using `camel-servlet` which runs under a specific `context-path`.

=== camel-file

In order to reduce memory pressure, the component was modified to avoid using Lists for certain file operations (CAMEL-17059). This affected the APIs of some the APIs and interfaces provided by the component.

- `GenericFileOperations`: the return type for the methods `listFiles` and `listFiles(String)` was modified to return an array of (generic) objects instead of a List
- `GenericFileConsumer`: the signature of the methods `isValidFile` and `isMatched` was modified to receive an array of files.

=== camel-ftp

The `FtpConsumer`, `FtpOperations`, `SftConsumer` and `SftpOperations` classes were modified to comply with the API changes on the `camel-file` component.

=== camel-jsch

The `ScpOperations` class were modified to comply with the API changes on the `camel-file` component.
