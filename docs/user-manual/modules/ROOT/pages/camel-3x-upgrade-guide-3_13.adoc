= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.12 to 3.13

=== API changes

Added method `getStartedEventNotifiers` to `org.apache.camel.spi.ManagementStrategy`.

Added method `scheduleQueue` to `org.apache.camel.spi.ReactiveExecutor`.

== Using transactions

The routing engine has been changed to route exchanges in a different order
when using transactions (`.transacted()`). When an `Exchange` is continued
routed a task is scheduled to the `ReactiveExecutor`. This fixed issues
with could lead to `StackOverflowException`.
