= Apache Camel Upgrade Recipes Project

This document provides instructions on how to use the automatic update tool to assist in the migration process.

== Introduction

To help with migration process, Camel Upgrade Recipes project based on OpenRewrite was developed.

NOTE:  The project is not designed to provide fully automated migration but rather to assist with manual migrations, making them more efficient and less error-prone.

Refer to the https://github.com/apache/camel-upgrade-recipes/blob/main/release_notes.adoc[release notes] of the Camel Upgrade Recipes Project to see the specific migrations covered by the upgrade tool.

== Running the Upgrade Tool

The migration tool is easy to run.
