= Camel Lifecycle

Camel uses a simple _lifecycle_ interface called
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/Service.html[Service]
which has `start()` and `stop()` methods.

Many of Camel's classes implement `Service` such as
`CamelContext` along with all `Component` and `Endpoint` classes.

When you use Camel you typically have to start the
`CamelContext` which will start all the various
components and endpoints and activate the routing rules until the
context is stopped again.

== CamelContext Lifecycle

The `CamelContext` provides methods to control its lifecycle:

* `build`
* `init`
* `start`
* `stop`
* `suspend`
* `resume`

The operations are paired: start/stop and suspend/resume.

Stop is performing a xref:graceful-shutdown.adoc[Graceful Shutdown]
which means all its internal state, cache, etc is cleared; and the
routes is being stopped in a graceful manner to ensure messages are given
time to complete.

IMPORTANT: If you start a `CamelContext` after a stop, then its
performing a _cold_ start, recreating all the state, cache etc. again; which is not guaranteed to startup correctly again.
Instead you can use the suspend/resume operations. They will keep the
`CamelContext` _warm_ and only suspend/stop routes using the same
graceful shutdown feature. This ensures messages are given time to complete.

End users is encouraged to use suspend/resume if you are temporary
stopping a Camel application.

All these operations are available in JMX as well,
so you can control Camel from JMX management.

== Service lifecycle

A service (`org.apache.camel.Service`) in Camel adheres to the following
lifecycle states as illustrated in the diagram below:

The `org.apache.camel.support.service.ServiceSupport` is a good base class to
extend for custom services as it offers the basic functionally to keep
track of state. You implement your custom logic in the `doStart`,
`doStop`, `doSuspend`, `doResume` methods.

TIP: A service can optimally support suspend/resume by the
`org.apache.camel.SuspendableService`. This means not all services in
Camel supports suspension. It's encouraged that consumers support
suspension which allows suspending/resuming routes.
