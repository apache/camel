= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.11 to 4.12

=== camel-core

The package scan classes has moved from `camel-base-engine` to `camel-support` JAR and moved to a new package:

- `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultPackageScanClassResolver` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.DefaultPackageScanClassResolver`
- `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultPackageScanResourceResolver` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.DefaultPackageScanResourceResolver`
- `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.WebSpherePackageScanClassResolver` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.WebSpherePackageScanClassResolver`
- `org.apache.camel.impl.scan.AnnotatedWithAnyPackageScanFilter` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.AnnotatedWithAnyPackageScanFilter`
- `org.apache.camel.impl.scan.AnnotatedWithPackageScanFilter` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.AnnotatedWithPackageScanFilter`
- `org.apache.camel.impl.scan.AssignableToPackageScanFilter` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.AssignableToPackageScanFilter`
- `org.apache.camel.impl.scan.CompositePackageScanFilter` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.CompositePackageScanFilter`
- `org.apache.camel.impl.scan.InvertingPackageScanFilter` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.scan.InvertingPackageScanFilter`

The `ExchangeHelper.copyResults` has been improved to also copy over exchange variables from the source to the target.

Removed unused `Johnzon` in `org.apache.camel.model.dataformat.JsonLibrary` enum as `camel-johnzon` is not supported
in Camel v4. This removal also means `johnzon` was removed from XSD and YAML DSL schemas.

Removed the `Exchange.BEAN_METHOD_NAME` constant as it has been deprecated and are not in use.

==== Header Filter Strategy

The default `HeaderFilterStrategy` has changed to be case-insensitive by default. This ensures that headers sent over transports
will be filtered also if they use different cases such as `camelKey` and `CAMELKEY`, `camelkey` would all be considered
the same key and filtered.

The default `HeaderFilterStrategy` has also removed filtering of keys starting with the legacy Camel v1 syntax `org.apache.camel.`.
Camel v2 onwards are using the `Camel...` key standard.

==== Propagating variables in EIPs in seda/kamelet components

The kamelet and seda component and EIPs such as Split, Multicast, Recipient List, Enrich, PollEnrich, Loop (copy mode)
will now also propagate exchange variables as well into the result (i.e. exchange properties and message headers is already being propagated).

==== Type Converters

Using type converters that has been marked to allow null via (`@Converter(allow-null = true)`) has been improved
to allow returning `null` as a positive answer when using `convertBodyTo` EIP and `mandatoryConvertTo` or `getMandatoryBody` etc.

This behavior was present in Camel v2 and some internal optimization in Camel v3 had changed
this to not be the case. Using type converters that can return `null` is a rare use-case, and it's not a good practice.

=== Java DSL

When using Choice EIP then in some situations you may need to use `.endChoice()`
to be able to either continue added more nodes to the current Choice EIP, or that you
are working with nested Choice EIPs (choice inside choice), then you may also need to use `endChoice`
to go back to the parent choice to continue from there.

However, there has been some regressions from upgrading older Camel releases to 4.11, and therefore
we have refactored `endChoice` to work more consistent.

For example the following code

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .choice()
        .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(1))
            .choice()
                .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(5))
                    .to("mock:big")
                .otherwise()
                    .to("mock:med")
            .endChoice()
        .otherwise()
            .to("mock:low")
        .end();
----

Should now be

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .choice()
        .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(1))
            .choice()
                .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(5))
                    .to("mock:big")
                .otherwise()
                    .to("mock:med")
            .end().endChoice()
        .otherwise()
            .to("mock:low")
        .end();
----

Notice that the `endChoice` is changed to `end().endChoice()`. This is required to be consistent
to end the current choice (inner) and then afterwards change the scope to be Choice EIP to be able to
continue in the outer Choice. Otherwise the Java DSL cannot know the scope is Choice EIP and you would
not be able to add the `otherwise` block to the outer Choice.

==== Rest DSL

When setting the context-path in _rest configuration_ then this now takes precedence over
the base-path defined in an openapi specification when using _rest dsl contract-first_.

For example

[source,yaml]
----
- restConfiguration:
    clientRequestValidation: true
    contextPath: /cheese
- rest:
    openApi:
      specification: petstore-v3.json
----

Then Camel will now use `/cheese` as the base-path for the Rest DSL API endpoints
from the `petstore-v3.json` openapi specification file.

=== camel-as2

Add options allowing the addition of an `Authorization` header for Basic or Bearer authentication to client and
asynchronous MDN requests.

=== camel-jackson / camel-jacksonxml

The default unmarshalType has been changed from `HashMap` to `LinkedHashMap` that keeps ordering of the elements
so they have similar order as the input document.

=== camel-micrometer

The `tags` parameter has been _fixed_ to be multivalued and tooling friendly. So
instead of configuring `tags=a=1&b=2` then this should be configured as `tags.a=1&tags.b=2` and so forth.

=== camel-main

We have introduced the possibility to use a management server where to expose management endpoints (such as health, metrics, etcetera). The new server will be available by default on port `9876`. This and other several configuration can be changed using `camel.management` application properties group. In order to avoid breaking compatibility, the previous services running on business port (default `8080`) will be still running on the old port AND on the new port for a few future releases. However, you're invited to move your configuration and adopt the new `camel.management` embedded server for management services as soon as possible.

=== camel-observability-services

As seen in `camel-main` change, the component is now adopting the new management port to expose its services. However, it will be still possible to use also the old port to avoid introducing any breaking compatibility. Mind that this possibility will be removed in future versions.

=== camel-microprofile-fault-tolerance

Some options on the `faultToleranceConfiguration` DSL have been removed:

* `bulkheadExecutorService`
* `timeoutScheduledExecutorService`

They are replaced with a new option `threadOffloadExecutorService` as a general purpose custom `ExecutorService` for fault tolerance thread offloading.

Similarly, there is now only a single `camel-main` configuration option for the fault tolerance `ExecutorService` named `camel.faulttolerance.threadOffloadExecutorService`.

`faultToleranceConfiguration` option  `circuitBreaker` is replaced by `typedGuard` and it's `camel-main` configuration option is `camel.main.faulttolerance.typedGuard`.

=== camel-smb

The `path` option is now configured in the context-path instead of query parameter.
This makes the endpoint more similar to other file based components.

Before:
[source,text]
----
smb://mysmbserver/myshare/?path=mypath
----

After:

[source,text]
----
smb://mysmbserver/myshare/mypath
----

TIP: The `path` can still be specified in the URI as backwards compatible.

=== Component Verifier Extensions and Metadata Extension

All of the component verifier extensions and metadata extensions have been removed from components.

There is one single exception for ServiceNow Metadata Extension since it is used in a MOJO.

More details could be found in CAMEL-22013.
