= Tracer

Camel's tracer is used for logging message details during routing, where
you can see the route path of each message as they happens. Details of the message is also logged such as the message body.

== Formatting

The tracer formats the execution of exchanges to log lines. They are
logged at *`INFO`* level in the log category:
*`org.apache.camel.Tracing`*. 

The message information from the Exchange is formatted using `ExchangeFormatter` and the default implementation has many options you can configure. See the source code/javadoc of the `org.apache.camel.support.processor.DefaultExchangeFormatter` class.

== Enabling

In Java you set tracing on `CamelContext`:

[source,java]
----
context.setTracing(true);
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext trace="true" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
...
</camelContext>
----

And in Spring Boot

[source,text]
----
camel.springboot.tracing = true
----
