= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.8 to 4.9

=== camel-api

Added `setLazyBeanStrategy`/`getLazyBeanStrategy` methods to `org.apache.camel.spi.CamelBeanPostProcessor`.

=== camel-management

The `queueSize` attribute on endpoints which are `ManagedBrowseableEndpoint` is changed from returning a `Long` value
to an `Integer` value.

=== camel-jms

The camel-jms component has changed its default `HeaderFilterStrategy` to also remove any `Camel...` headers,
to act similar to other Camel components. If the old classic behavior is needed then you can configure the `JmsComponent` to use `org.apache.camel.component.jms.ClassicJmsHeaderFilterStrategy`
as header filter strategy which is the old implementation.

Added `int limit` as parameter to the `browse` method in `org.apache.camel.component.jms.QueueBrowseStrategy`.

=== camel-hashicorp-vault properties function

The syntax for retrieving a single field of a secret has been changed.

From this

`{{hashicorp:secret:database/username}}`

to this

`{{hashicorp:secret:database#username}}`

=== camel-test

The `CamelTestSupport` class was modified so that the JUnit 5 extension code that was part of the class itself,
was moved to a separate class. This is part of the work being done on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-20837[CAMEL-20837]
to modernize the base test code.

In many cases, code should work with no changes provided they are not using any of the API methods that
were deprecated in Camel 4.7.0.
Additionally, starting with Camel 4.9, we strongly recommend users to avoid relying on single-instance contexts (created
via `@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`), as this is considered a deprecated functionality that will be removed in the
future.
The logs will print a warning message if this behavior is detected.

=== Removed API

The following modules has been removed:

* camel-kotlin-dsl

=== Deprecated Components
