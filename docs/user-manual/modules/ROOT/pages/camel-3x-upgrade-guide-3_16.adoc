= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.15 to 3.16

=== camel-core

Change the default from `Override` to `Ignore` in the `TypeConverterExists` option,
and the TypeConverterExistsLoggingLevel from `WARN` to `DEBUG`.

Previously when Camel detected a duplicate type converter during startup, Camel would
override the existing converter and log a WARN. A more correct behaviour would be
to keep the existing and ignore the duplicate.

Removed the deprecated class `org.apache.camel.impl.RouteIdFactory`.

=== Rest DSL

The Rest DSL have some changes.

==== Removed support for embedded routes

The Rest DSL no longer allows embedding routes directly into each REST service.
Instead, you must use `to` to route to a Camel endpoint. If you have an embedded
route you can them make this into an individual route using `direct` as the input endpoint,
and then link to this route from the REST service.

For example

[source,java]
----
rest("/users")
  .get("/{id}")
  .route().
    // embedded route here
----

Should now be:

[source,java]
----
rest("/users")
  .get("/{id}")
  .to("direct:users-by-id");

from("direct:users-by-id")
    // embedded route here
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<rest path="/users">
  <get path="/{id}">
    <route>
      ...
   </route>
  </get>
</rest>
----

Should now be:

[source,xml]
----
<rest path="/users">
  <get path="/{id}">
    <to uri="direct:users-by-id"/>
  </get>
</rest>

<route>
  <from uri="direct:users-by-id"/>
  ...
</route>
----

==== Renamed uri to path

Rename `uri` to `path` on the verb classes listed above.
When using XML or YAML DSL then migration is needed such as:

[source,xml]
----
<rest>
  <get uri="/hello/{name}">
    ...
  </get>
</rest>
----

Should be:

[source,xml]
----
<rest>
  <get path="/hello/{name}">
    ...
  </get>
</rest>
----

And in YAML DSL:

[source,yaml]
----
rest:
  get:
    - uri: "/hello/{name}"
      to: "direct:hello"
----

Should be:

[source,yaml]
----
rest:
  get:
    - path: "/hello/{name}"
      to: "direct:hello"
----

==== Renamed classes

The generic verb-based definition, where the HTTP verb can be specified as a string value
is no longer supported for defining a REST service.
Only the built-in verbs (get, post, put etc.) must be used.

Renamed the following classes in package `org.apache.camel.model.rest`:

- `DeleteVerbDefinition` to `DeleteDefinition`
- `GetVerbDefinition` to `GetDefinition`
- `HeadVerbDefinition` to `HeadDefinition`
- `PatchVerbDefinition` to `PatchDefinition`
- `PostVerbDefinition` to `PostDefinition`
- `PutVerbDefinition` to `PutDefinition`
- `RestSecurityApiKey` to `ApiKeyDefinition`
- `RestSecurityBasicAuth` to `BasicAuthDefinition`
- `RestSecurityBearerToken` to `BearerTokenDefinition`
- `RestSecurityMultalTLS` to `MutalTLSDefinition`
- `RestSecurityOAuth2` to `OAuth2Definition`
- `RestSecurityOpenIdConnect` to `OpenIdConnectDefinition`
- `RestOperationParamDefinition` to `ParamDefinition`
- `RestOperationResponseHeaderDefinition` to `ResponseHeaderDefinition`
- `RestOperationResponseMsgDefinition` to `ResponseMessageDefinition`

==== Removed classes

For the sake of simplicity, the class `RestSecuritiesRequirement` has been removed because it contains only elements of type `SecurityDefinition` which have been moved directly into `RestDefinition`.

=== Aggregate EIP

Renamed `strategyRef` to `aggregationStrategy`, and marked this option as required.
Renamed `strategyMethodName` to `aggregationStrategyMethodName`.
Renamed `strategyMethodAllowNull` to `aggregationStrategyMethodAllowNull`.
Renamed `aggregationRepositoryRef` to `aggregationRepository`.
Renamed `aggregateControllerRef` to `aggregateController`.
Renamed `executorServiceRef` to `executorService`.
Renamed `timeoutCheckerExecutorServiceRef` to `timeoutCheckerExecutorService`.
Removed some deprecated methods, and some unnecessary methods in Java DSL.

=== Circuit Breaker EIP

Renamed `circuitBreakerRef` to `circuitBreaker`.
Renamed `configRef` to `config`.
Renamed `bulkheadExecutorServiceRef` to `bulkheadExecutorService`.
Renamed `timeoutScheduledExecutorServiceRef` to `timeoutScheduledExecutorService`.

=== Claim Check EIP

Renamed `strategyRef` to `aggregationStrategy`, and marked this option as required.
Renamed `strategyMethodName` to `aggregationStrategyMethodName`.
Removed some unnecessary methods in Java DSL.

=== Delay EIP

Renamed `executorServiceRef` to `executorService`.

=== DoSwitch EIP

Replaced by Choice EIP in precondition mode.

Before it was:
[source,java]
----
.doSwitch()
    .when(simple("{{?red}}")).to("mock:red")
    .when(simple("{{?blue}}")).to("mock:blue")
.end()
----

Now it is:
[source,java]
----
.choice().precondition()
    .when(simple("{{?red}}")).to("mock:red")
    .when(simple("{{?blue}}")).to("mock:blue")
.end()
----

=== Enrich & Poll Enrich EIPs

Renamed `strategyRef` to `aggregationStrategy`, and marked this option as required.
Renamed `strategyMethodName` to `aggregationStrategyMethodName`.
Renamed `strategyMethodAllowNull` to `aggregationStrategyMethodAllowNull`.
Removed some deprecated methods, and some unnecessary methods in Java DSL.

=== Idempotent Consumer EIP

Renamed `messageIdRepositoryRef` to `idempotentRepository`.
Removed some unnecessary methods in Java DSL.

=== Log EIP

Renamed `loggerRef` to `logger`.

=== Multicast, Recipient List & Split EIP

Renamed `strategyRef` to `aggregationStrategy`.
Renamed `strategyMethodName` to `aggregationStrategyMethodName`.
Renamed `strategyMethodAllowNull` to `aggregationStrategyMethodAllowNull`.
Renamed `onPrepareRef` to `onPrepare`.
Renamed `executorServiceRef` to `executorService`.
Removed some deprecated methods, and some unnecessary methods in Java DSL.

=== OnCompletion EIP

Renamed `executorServiceRef` to `executorService`.

=== Resequence EIP

Renamed `comparatorRef` to `comparator`.

=== Sort EIP

Renamed `comparatorRef` to `comparator`.

=== Threads EIP

Renamed `executorServiceRef` to `executorService`.

=== Throttle EIP

Renamed `executorServiceRef` to `executorService`.

=== Saga EIP

Renamed `sagaServiceRef` to `sagaService`.
Removed the deprecated `timeoutInMilliseconds` option, use `timeout` instead.

In the `<option>` the `optionName` is renamed to `key`. When using XML DSL then this is affected as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<saga sagaServiceRef="mySagaService">
    <compensation uri="mock:compensation"/>
    <completion uri="mock:completion"/>
    <option optionName="myOptionKey">
        <constant>myOptionValue</constant>
    </option>
    <option optionName="myOptionKey2">
        <constant>myOptionValue2</constant>
    </option>
</saga>
----

To:

[source,xml]
----
<saga sagaServiceRef="mySagaService">
    <compensation uri="mock:compensation"/>
    <completion uri="mock:completion"/>
    <option key="myOptionKey">
        <constant>myOptionValue</constant>
    </option>
    <option key="myOptionKey2">
        <constant>myOptionValue2</constant>
    </option>
</saga>
----

=== WireTap EIP

Renamed `onPrepareRef` to `onPrepare`.
Renamed `executorServiceRef` to `executorService`.
Removed the _new message_ mode as this functionality is better done by using onPrepare processor in copy mode.

=== camel-health

The `HealthCheck` API has been simplified and removed the following configurations:

- interval
- success threshold
- failure threshold

These options would complicate health checks as they affect the outcome of health checks.
It is better the checks always execute and the responsibility of the monitoring systems
how to deal with interval between checks and thresholds.

Removed the option to disable context health check as it should always be enabled.

==== Disabling health checks

The configuration for disabling individual health-checks has changed

Before each health-check could be configured and set `enabled=false`. For example
to disable health-checks for route with id `netty` you would do:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.config[netty].check = routes
camel.health.config[netty].enabled = false
----

With Camel 3.16 onwards you instead specify pattern(s) for health checks to be excluded
from being invoked, which is done in a single configuration:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exclude-pattern = netty
----

You can specify multiple patterns (and use wildcards) such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.health.exclude-pattern = netty,foo,bar*
----

=== camel-main

The option `camel.main.packageScanRouteBuilders` has been renamed to `camel.main.basePackageScan`.

Using configuration classes must now implement the interface `org.apache.camel.main.CamelConfiguration`
and the `configure` method now takes a `CamelContext` as argument.

=== camel-any23

The option `baseURI` is renamed to `baseUri`.

=== camel-aws

The `camel-aws2-sqs` component will now map message headers from their original type
such as boolean, integer, etc. This requires using Camel for both sending and receiving
as AWS only have string or binary types, so Camel stores custom metadata in the message header
to know its original type.

=== camel-stream

The producer will now by default append new line character to end of output.
The option `appendNewLine` can be used to turn this off.

=== camel-testcontainers

This component was deprecated and is removed on this version. Users should migrate to xref:test-infra.adoc[camel-test-infra].

=== camel-testcontainers-junit5

This component was deprecated and is removed on this version. Users should migrate to xref:test-infra.adoc[camel-test-infra].

=== camel-testcontainers-spring

This component was deprecated and is removed on this version. Users should migrate to xref:test-infra.adoc[camel-test-infra].

=== camel-testcontainers-spring-junit5

This component was deprecated and is removed on this version. Users should migrate to xref:test-infra.adoc[camel-test-infra].
