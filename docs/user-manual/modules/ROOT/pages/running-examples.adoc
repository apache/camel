= Running Examples

== Before you start

To run the demos with maven, you need to
http://maven.apache.org[download and install Apache Maven].

To test your Maven install, change directory to the examples directory
and type:

[source,shell]
----
mvn -v
----

You should see something like:

[source,shell]
----
camel-rider:/tmp/camel/examples$ mvn -v
Maven version: 3.0.3
----

== Running the examples in Maven

To run the xref:walk-through-an-example.adoc[first example] using Maven,
change directory to the example you want to run then issue the following
command:

[source,shell]
----
mvn exec:java
----

To run the other Spring-based examples such as the
xref:spring-example.adoc[Spring Example], use the
xref:camel-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Maven Plugin]. For example:

[source,shell]
----
cd camel-example-spring
mvn camel:run
----

== Running the examples in your IDE

In each example you can run the main() from your IDE.

To create an IDEA project, run

[source,shell]
----
mvn idea:idea
----

If you are an Eclipse user, run

[source,shell]
----
mvn eclipse:eclipse
----

You should now be able to open the project(s) in your IDE and run any
main() method you wish.
