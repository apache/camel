= POJO Consuming

To consume a message you use the
`org.apache.camel.Consume`
annotation to mark a particular method of a bean as being a consumer
method. The uri of the annotation defines the Camel
xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] to consume from.

e.g. lets invoke the `onCheese()` method with the String body of the
inbound JMS message from xref:components::activemq-component.adoc[ActiveMQ] on the cheese
queue; this will use the xref:type-converter.adoc[Type Converter] to
convert the JMS ObjectMessage or BytesMessage to a String - or just use
a TextMessage from JMS

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public class Foo {

  @Consume("activemq:cheese")
  public void onCheese(String name) {
    ...
  }
}
----

The xref:bean-binding.adoc[Bean Binding] is then used to convert the
inbound xref:{eip-vc}:eips:message.adoc[Message] to the parameter list used to invoke
the method .

What this does is basically create a route that looks kinda like this

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
from(uri).bean(theBean, "methodName");
----

**When using more than one CamelContext**

When you use more than 1 xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] you might
end up with each of them creating a xref:pojo-consuming.adoc[POJO
Consuming]; therefore use the option `context` on *@Consume* that allows
you to specify which xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] id/name you
want it to apply for.

[[POJOConsuming-UsingcontextoptiontoapplyonlyacertainCamelContext]]
== Using context option to apply only a certain CamelContext

See the warning above.

You can use the `context` option to specify which
xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] the consumer should only apply for.
For example:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  @Consume(uri="activemq:cheese", context="camel-1")
  public void onCheese(String name) {
----

The consumer above will only be created for the
xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] that have the context id =
`camel-1`. You set this id in the XML tag:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
<camelContext id="camel-1" ...>
----

[[POJOConsuming-Usinganexplicitroute]]
== Using an explicit route

If you want to invoke a bean method from many different endpoints or
within different complex routes in different circumstances you can just
use the normal routing xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] or the
xref:spring.adoc[Spring] XML configuration file.

For example

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
from(uri).beanRef("myBean", "methodName");
----

which will then look up in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] and find the
bean and invoke the given bean name. (You can omit the method name and
have Camel figure out the right method based on the method annotations
and body type).

[[POJOConsuming-UsetheBeanendpoint]]
== Use the Bean endpoint

You can always use the bean endpoint

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
from(uri).to("bean:myBean?method=methodName");
----

[[POJOConsuming-Usingapropertytodefinetheendpoint]]
== Using a property to define the endpoint

*Since Camel 2.11*

The following annotations @Consume, @Produce, @EndpointInject, now
offers a `property` attribute you can use to define the endpoint as a
property on the bean. Then Camel will use the getter method to access
the property.

**This applies for them all**

The explanation below applies for all the three annotations, eg
@Consume, @Produce, and @EndpointInject

For example

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public class MyService {
  private String serviceEndpoint;
  
  public void setServiceEndpoint(String uri) {
     this.serviceEndpoint = uri;
  }

  public String getServiceEndpoint() {
     return serviceEndpoint
  }

  @Consume(property = "serviceEndpoint")
  public void onService(String input) {
     ...
  }
}
----

The bean `MyService` has a property named `serviceEndpoint` which has
getter/setter for the property. Now we want to use the bean for
xref:pojo-consuming.adoc[POJO Consuming], and hence why we use @Consume
in the onService method. Notice how we use the
`property = "serviceEndpoint` to configure the property that has the
endpoint url.

If you define the bean in Spring XML or Blueprint, then you can
configure the property as follows:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
<bean id="myService" class="com.foo.MyService">
  <property name="serviceEndpoint" value="activemq:queue:foo"/>
</bean>
----

This allows you to configure the bean using any standard IoC style.

Camel offers a naming convention which allows you to not have to
explicit name the property. +
Camel uses this algorithm to find the getter method. The method must be
a getXXX method.

1. Use the property name if explicit given
2. If no property name was configured, then use the method name +
3. Try to get the property with name*Endpoint* (eg with Endpoint as
postfix)
4. Try to get the property with the name as is (eg no postfix or
postfix)
5. If the property name starts with *on* then omit that, and try step 3
and 4 again.

So in the example above, we could have defined the @Consume annotation
as

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  @Consume(property = "service")
  public void onService(String input) {
----

Now the property is named 'service' which then would match step 3 from
the algorithm, and have Camel invoke the getServiceEndpoint method.

We could also have omitted the property attribute, to make it implicit

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  @Consume
  public void onService(String input) {
----

Now Camel matches step 5, and loses the prefix *on* in the name, and
looks for 'service' as the property. And because there is a
getServiceEndpoint method, Camel will use that.

[[POJOConsuming-Whichapproachtouse]]
== Which approach to use?

Using the @Consume annotations are simpler when you are creating a
simple route with a single well defined input URI.

However if you require more complex routes or the same bean method needs
to be invoked from many places then please use the routing
xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] as shown above.
