[[Security-Security]]
= Security

Camel offers several forms & levels of security capabilities that can be
utilized on camel routes. These various forms of security may be used in
conjunction with each other or separately.

The broad categories offered are

* Route Security - Authentication and Authorization services to proceed
on a route or route segment
* Payload Security - Data Formats that offer encryption/decryption
services at the payload level
* Endpoint Security - Security offered by components that can be
utilized by endpointUri associated with the component
* Configuration Security - Security offered by encrypting sensitive
information from configuration files

[[Security-RouteSecurity-AuthenticationandAuthorizationServices]]
== Route Security - Authentication and Authorization Services

Camel offers Policy driven security capabilities that may be wired into
routes or route segments. A Policy in Camel utilizes a strategy pattern
for applying interceptors on Camel Processors. It offering the ability
to apply cross-cutting concerns (for example. security, transactions
etc) on sections/segments of a camel route.

The components offering authentication and authorization Services
utilizing Route Policies are

* xref:components::shiro.adoc[Shiro Security]
* xref:components::spring-security.adoc[Spring Security]

[[Security-PayloadSecurity-DataFormatsandProducers/Consumersofferingencryption/decryptionservices]]
== Payload Security - Data Formats and Producers/Consumers offering encryption/decryption services

Camel offers encryption/decryption services to secure payloads or
selectively apply encryption/decryption capabilities on
portions/sections of a payload.

These capabilites are offered by the following components

* xref:components:dataformats:secureXML-dataformat.adoc[XMLSecurity DataFormat] (XML
Encryption support)
* xref:components:dataformats:crypto-dataformat.adoc[Crypto DataFormat] (Encryption + PGP support)
* xref:components::crypto-component.adoc[Crypto component] (Signature
support)

[[Security-EndpointSecurity]]
== Endpoint Security

Some components in camel offer an ability to secure their endpoints
(using interceptors etc) and therefore ensure that they offer the
ability to secure payloads as well as provide
authentication/authorization capabilities at endpoints created using the
components.

Some such components are

* xref:components::jetty-component.adoc[Jetty] - HTTP Basic Authentication support * SSL
support
* xref:components::cxf-component.adoc[CXF] - HTTP Basic Authentication & WS-Security support
using the CXF Bus driven interceptor chain
* xref:components::spring-ws-component.adoc[Spring Web Services] - HTTP Basic
Authentication & WS-Security support
* xref:components::netty-component.adoc[Netty] - SSL support
* xref:components::mina-component.adoc[MINA] - SSL support
* xref:components::cometd-component.adoc[Cometd] - SSL support
* xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] - JAAS and SSL based security for client <-->
broker communication

[[Security-ConfigurationSecurity]]
== Configuration Security

*Since Camel 2.5*

Camel offers the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component to
externalize configuration values to properties files. Those values could
contain sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. Those
values can be encrypted and automatic decrypted by Camel.

* xref:components::jasypt.adoc[Jasypt]

*Since Camel 2.8*

Camel offers the xref:camel-configuration-utilities.adoc[JSSE Utility]
for configuring SSL/TLS related aspects of a number of Camel components.
