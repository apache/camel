= Security

Camel offers several forms & levels of security capabilities that can be
utilized on Camel routes. These various forms of security may be used in
conjunction with each other or separately.

The broad categories offered are:

* _Route Security_ - Authentication and Authorization services to proceed
on a route or route segment
* _Payload Security_ - Data Formats that offer encryption/decryption
services at the payload level
* _Endpoint Security_ - Security offered by components that can be
utilized by endpointUri associated with the component
* _Configuration Security_ - Security offered by encrypting sensitive
information from configuration files or external Secured Vault systems.

Camel offers the xref:camel-configuration-utilities.adoc[JSSE Utility]
for configuring SSL/TLS related aspects of a number of Camel components.

== Route Security

Authentication and Authorization Services

Camel offers xref:route-policy.adoc[Route Policy] driven security capabilities that may be wired into
routes or route segments. A route policy in Camel utilizes a strategy pattern
for applying interceptors on Camel Processors. It's offering the ability
to apply cross-cutting concerns (for example. security, transactions etc) of a Camel route.

The components offering authentication and authorization services
utilizing xref:route-policy.adoc[Route Policy] are:

* xref:components:others:shiro.adoc[Shiro Security]
* xref:components:others:spring-security.adoc[Spring Security]

== Payload Security

Camel offers encryption/decryption services to secure payloads or
selectively apply encryption/decryption capabilities on
portions/sections of a payload.

== Endpoint Security

Some components in Camel offer an ability to secure their endpoints
(using interceptors etc) and therefore ensure that they offer the
ability to secure payloads as well as provide
authentication/authorization capabilities at endpoints created using the
components.

== Configuration Security

Camel offers the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component to
externalize configuration values to properties files. Those values could
contain sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.

Those values can be encrypted and automatic decrypted by Camel using:

* xref:components:others:jasypt.adoc[Jasypt]

Camel also support accessing the secured configuration from an external vault systems.

=== Configuration Security using Vaults

The following _Vaults_ are supported by Camel:

* xref:components::aws-secrets-manager-component.adoc[AWS Secrets Manager]
// TODO: Enable link when website build works again
// * xref:components::google-secret-manager-component.adoc[Google Secret Manager]
// * xref:components::azure-key-vault-component.adoc[Azure Key Vault]

==== Using AWS Vault

To use AWS Secrets Manager you need to provide _accessKey_, _secretKey_ and the _region_.
This can be done using environmental variables before starting the application:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=accessKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_SECRET_KEY=secretKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_REGION=region
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.accessKey = accessKey
camel.vault.aws.secretKey = secretKey
camel.vault.aws.region = region
----

At this point you'll be able to reference a property in the following way by using `aws:` as prefix in the `{{ }}` syntax:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Where `route` will be the name of the secret stored in the AWS Secrets Manager Service.

You could specify a default value in case the secret is not present on AWS Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{aws:route:default}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist, the property will fallback to "default" as value.

Also, you are able to get particular field of the secret, if you have for example a secret named database of this form:

[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123",
  "engine": "postgres",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3128",
  "dbname": "db"
}
----

You're able to do get single secret value in your route, like for example:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{aws:database/username}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Or re-use the property as part of an endpoint.

You could specify a default value in case the particular field of secret is not present on AWS Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{aws:database/username:admin}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist or the secret exists, but the username field is not part of the secret, the property will fallback to "admin" as value.

NOTE: For the moment we are not considering the rotation function, if any will be applied, but it is in the work to be done.

The only requirement is adding `camel-aws-secrets-manager` JAR to your Camel application.

==== Using GCP Vault

To use GCP Secret Manager you need to provide _serviceAccountKey_ file and GCP _projectId_.
This can be done using environmental variables before starting the application:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=file:////path/to/service.accountkey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_GCP_PROJECT_ID=projectId
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.gcp.serviceAccountKey = accessKey
camel.vault.gcp.projectId = secretKey
----

If you want instead to use the https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production[GCP default client instance], you'll need to provide the following env variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_GCP_USE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE=true
export $CAMEL_VAULT_GCP_PROJECT_ID=projectId
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.gcp.useDefaultInstance = true
camel.vault.aws.projectId = region
----

At this point you'll be able to reference a property in the following way by using `gcp:` as prefix in the `{{ }}` syntax:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{gcp:route}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Where `route` will be the name of the secret stored in the GCP Secret Manager Service.

You could specify a default value in case the secret is not present on GCP Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{gcp:route:default}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist, the property will fallback to "default" as value.

Also, you are able to get particular field of the secret, if you have for example a secret named database of this form:

[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123",
  "engine": "postgres",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3128",
  "dbname": "db"
}
----

You're able to do get single secret value in your route, like for example:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{gcp:database/username}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Or re-use the property as part of an endpoint.

You could specify a default value in case the particular field of secret is not present on GCP Secret Manager:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{gcp:database/username:admin}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist or the secret exists, but the username field is not part of the secret, the property will fallback to "admin" as value.

NOTE: For the moment we are not considering the rotation function, if any will be applied, but it is in the work to be done.

There are only two requirements: 
- Adding `camel-google-secret-manager` JAR to your Camel application.
- Give the service account used permissions to do operation at secret management level (for example accessing the secret payload, or being admin of secret manager service)

==== Using Azure Key Vault

To use this function you'll need to provide credentials to Azure Key Vault Service as environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_TENANT_ID=tenantId
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=clientId
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=clientSecret
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_VAULT_NAME=vaultName
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.azure.tenantId = accessKey
camel.vault.azure.clientId = clientId
camel.vault.azure.clientSecret = clientSecret
camel.vault.azure.vaultName = vaultName
----

At this point you'll be able to reference a property in the following way:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{azure:route}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Where route will be the name of the secret stored in the Azure Key Vault Service.

You could specify a default value in case the secret is not present on Azure Key Vault Service:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{azure:route:default}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist, the property will fallback to "default" as value.

Also you are able to get particular field of the secret, if you have for example a secret named database of this form:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123",
  "engine": "postgres",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3128",
  "dbname": "db"
}
----

You're able to do get single secret value in your route, like for example:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{azure:database/username}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Or re-use the property as part of an endpoint.

You could specify a default value in case the particular field of secret is not present on Azure Key Vault:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{azure:database/username:admin}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist or the secret exists, but the username field is not part of the secret, the property will fallback to "admin" as value.

For the moment we are not considering the rotation function, if any will be applied, but it is in the work to be done.

The only requirement is adding the camel-azure-key-vault jar to your Camel application.

==== Using Hashicorp Vault

To use this function you'll need to provide credentials for Hashicorp vault as environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_TOKEN=token
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_ENGINE=secretKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_HOST=host
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_PORT=port
export $CAMEL_VAULT_HASHICORP_SCHEME=http/https
----

You can also configure the credentials in the `application.properties` file such as:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.hashicorp.token = token
camel.vault.hashicorp.engine = engine
camel.vault.hashicorp.host = host
camel.vault.hashicorp.port = port
camel.vault.hashicorp.scheme = scheme
----

At this point you'll be able to reference a property in the following way:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Where route will be the name of the secret stored in the Hashicorp Vault instance.

You could specify a default value in case the secret is not present on Hashicorp Vault instance:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route:default}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist, the property will fallback to "default" as value.

Also you are able to get particular field of the secret, if you have for example a secret named database of this form:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123",
  "engine": "postgres",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3128",
  "dbname": "db"
}
----

You're able to do get single secret value in your route, like for example:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{hashicorp:database/username}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

Or re-use the property as part of an endpoint.

You could specify a default value in case the particular field of secret is not present on Hashicorp Vault instance:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{hashicorp:database/username:admin}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

In this case if the secret doesn't exist or the secret exists, but the username field is not part of the secret, the property will fallback to "admin" as value.

There is also the syntax to get a particular version of the secret for both the approach, with field/default value specified or only with secret:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route@2}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the RAW route secret with version '2'.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{hashicorp:route:default@2}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the route secret value with version '2' or default value in case the secret doesn't exist or the version doesn't exist.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <log message="Username is {{hashicorp:database/username:admin@2}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

This approach will return the username field of the database secret with version '2' or admin in case the secret doesn't exist or the version doesn't exist.

The only requirement is adding the camel-hashicorp-vault jar to your Camel application.

==== Automatic Camel context reloading on Secret Refresh while using AWS Secrets Manager

Being able to reload Camel context on a Secret Refresh, could be done by specifying the usual credentials (the same used for AWS Secret Manager Property Function).

With Environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_USE_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=accessKey
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AWS_REGION=region
----

or as plain Camel main properties:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.useDefaultCredentialProvider = true
camel.vault.aws.region = region
----

Or by specifying accessKey/SecretKey and region, instead of using the default credentials provider chain.

To enable the automatic refresh you'll need additional properties to set:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.aws.refreshEnabled=true
camel.vault.aws.refreshPeriod=60000
camel.vault.aws.secrets=Secret
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
----

where `camel.vault.aws.refreshEnabled` will enable the automatic context reload, `camel.vault.aws.refreshPeriod` is the interval of time between two different checks for update events and `camel.vault.aws.secrets` is a regex representing the secrets we want to track for updates.

Note that `camel.vault.aws.secrets` is not mandatory: if not specified the task responsible for checking updates events will take into accounts or the properties with an `aws:` prefix.

The only requirement is adding the camel-aws-secrets-manager jar to your Camel application.

==== Automatic Camel context reloading on Secret Refresh while using Google Secret Manager

Being able to reload Camel context on a Secret Refresh, could be done by specifying the usual credentials (the same used for Google Secret Manager Property Function).

With Environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_GCP_USE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE=true
export $CAMEL_VAULT_GCP_PROJECT_ID=projectId
----

or as plain Camel main properties:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.gcp.useDefaultInstance = true
camel.vault.aws.projectId = projectId
----

Or by specifying a path to a service account key file, instead of using the default instance.

To enable the automatic refresh you'll need additional properties to set:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.gcp.projectId= projectId
camel.vault.gcp.refreshEnabled=true
camel.vault.gcp.refreshPeriod=60000
camel.vault.gcp.secrets=hello*
camel.vault.gcp.subscriptionName=subscriptionName
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
----

where `camel.vault.gcp.refreshEnabled` will enable the automatic context reload, `camel.vault.gcp.refreshPeriod` is the interval of time between two different checks for update events and `camel.vault.gcp.secrets` is a regex representing the secrets we want to track for updates.

Note that `camel.vault.gcp.secrets` is not mandatory: if not specified the task responsible for checking updates events will take into accounts or the properties with an `gcp:` prefix.

The `camel.vault.gcp.subscriptionName` is the subscription name created in relation to the Google PubSub topic associated with the tracked secrets.

This mechanism while make use of the notification system related to Google Secret Manager: through this feature, every secret could be associated to one up to ten Google Pubsub Topics. These topics will receive 
events related to life cycle of the secret.

There are only two requirements: 
- Adding `camel-google-secret-manager` JAR to your Camel application.
- Give the service account used permissions to do operation at secret management level (for example accessing the secret payload, or being admin of secret manager service and also have permission over the Pubsub service)

==== Automatic Camel context reloading on Secret Refresh while using Azure Key Vault

Being able to reload Camel context on a Secret Refresh, could be done by specifying the usual credentials (the same used for Azure Key Vault Property Function).

With Environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_TENANT_ID=tenantId
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=clientId
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=clientSecret
export $CAMEL_VAULT_AZURE_VAULT_NAME=vaultName
----

or as plain Camel main properties:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.azure.tenantId = accessKey
camel.vault.azure.clientId = clientId
camel.vault.azure.clientSecret = clientSecret
camel.vault.azure.vaultName = vaultName
----

To enable the automatic refresh you'll need additional properties to set:

[source,properties]
----
camel.vault.azure.refreshEnabled=true
camel.vault.azure.refreshPeriod=60000
camel.vault.azure.secrets=Secret
camel.vault.azure.eventhubConnectionString=eventhub_conn_string
camel.vault.azure.blobAccountName=blob_account_name
camel.vault.azure.blobContainerName=blob_container_name
camel.vault.azure.blobAccessKey=blob_access_key
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
----

where `camel.vault.azure.refreshEnabled` will enable the automatic context reload, `camel.vault.azure.refreshPeriod` is the interval of time between two different checks for update events and `camel.vault.azure.secrets` is a regex representing the secrets we want to track for updates.

where `camel.vault.azure.eventhubConnectionString` is the eventhub connection string to get notification from, `camel.vault.azure.blobAccountName`, `camel.vault.azure.blobContainerName` and `camel.vault.azure.blobAccessKey` are the Azure Storage Blob parameters for the checkpoint store needed by Azure Eventhub.

Note that `camel.vault.azure.secrets` is not mandatory: if not specified the task responsible for checking updates events will take into accounts or the properties with an `azure:` prefix.

The only requirement is adding the camel-azure-key-vault jar to your Camel application.
