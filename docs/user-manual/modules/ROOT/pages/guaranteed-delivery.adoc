== Guaranteed Delivery

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/GuaranteedMessaging.html[Guaranteed
Delivery] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns] using among others the following components:

* xref:file2.adoc[File] for using file systems as a persistent store of
messages
* xref:jms-component.adoc[JMS] when using persistent delivery (the default) for
working with JMS Queues and Topics for high performance, clustering and
load balancing
* xref:jpa-component.adoc[JPA] for using a database as a persistence layer, or use
any of the many other database component such as xref:sql-component.adoc[SQL],
xref:jdbc-component.adoc[JDBC],
xref:mybatis-component.adoc[MyBatis],
xref:hibernate.adoc[Hibernate]
* xref:hawtdb.adoc[HawtDB] for a lightweight key-value persistent store

[[GuaranteedDelivery-Example]]
=== Example

The following example demonstrates illustrates the use
of http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/GuaranteedMessaging.html[Guaranteed
Delivery] within the xref:jms-component.adoc[JMS] component. By default, a message
is not considered successfully delivered until the recipient has
persisted the message locally guaranteeing its receipt in the event the
destination becomes unavailable.
