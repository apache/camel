= Improving the documentation

The Apache Camel project loves your help with improving the documentation, whether its
a tiny typo fix, or adding more details to an existing component, etc.

NOTE: This page only describes working with the 'documentation' portion of the website.
Other portions are written in markdown and built using Hugo.

== Where to find the documentation

All of the documentation accessible in the left-hand navigation panel in the documentation portion of the website is managed in the link:https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc format] and built with the https://antora.org[Antora] static site generator.
As of November 2021, by far the most capable Asciidoc editor is the Intellij Asciidoc plugin, which works with  all Intellij editor projects including the free Community Edition.
The plugin preview is more capable than viewing a local Asciidoc file with a browser plugin as it has some understanding of Antora structure.

The files have the extension `.adoc` and are managed in the Camel repositories.
General documentation is usually directly editable.
Component specific documentation is partially or entirely generated from other metadata sources which are in turn generated from the code, often from javadoc.
Altering generated documentation requires finding the original source, which varies by project.
Editable pages are found in several different places in the repositories:

Main camel repository::
Camel components::: In the `src/main/docs` folder for the component or camel module.
These are symlinked to under `docs/components`.
EIPs::: In the `core/camel-core-engine/src/main/docs` folder.
Core languages::: In the `core/camel-core-languages/src/main/docs` folder.
Note that many languages are under `components`.
User manual and FAQS::: In the `/docs/user-manual` folder.
Camel Karaf:: In the `docs` folder.
Camel Spring Boot:: Most documentation is generated and appended to the component documentation it applies to.
Editable pages are under `docs/spring-boot` and `core/camel-spring-boot/src/main/docs` and `core/camel-spring-boot-xml/src/main/docs`.

Other subprojects::
camel-k, camel-k-runtime::: Under `docs`.
There is no generated `camel-k` documentation.
camel-kafka-connector::: Editable pages are under `docs`.
Most documentation is generated directly from the generated json files for each connector under `connectors/<connector-name>/src/generated/resources`.
camel-kamelets::: Only `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc` is editable.
All other documentation is generated from the kamelet yaml descriptors.
camel-quarkus::: Editable pages are under `docs`.
Pages under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/reference/components` and `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/reference/extensions` are generated, including optional snippets from e.g. `extensions/activemq/src/main/doc`.
camel-quarkus-examples::: Editable pages are under `docs`.

== Creating a documentation pull request.

NOTE: Simple changes such as typo fixes or rewording can usually be done directly at GitHub after pressing the `edit this page` button at the top left of each page.
Note that if the page source starts with a comment that the page is copied or generated this will not work!
Please do not use this method if you are changing any xrefs or making significant changes to format; instead follow the procedure below.

. Fork/clone the appropriate repository from GitHub and switch to the branch you are working with.
. Create a branch for your work with a name starting with the original branch name, e.g. `git switch -c main-doc-fix`
. Edit the `.adoc` sources as needed.
Preview your work in the Intellij Asciidoc plugin preview or in a browser with an Asciidoctor extension installed.
. Do a xref:#_how_to_build_the_website_locally_with_your_changes[local website build with your changes].
//=== The following workflow may be usable after https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/831 is implemented, perhaps with the aid of an Antora extension.
//. Commit and push your work and create a PR in the (sub)project repository.
//Note the PR number, e.g. #456
//. Fork/clone the camel-website repository, and create an appropriate branch, e.g. `git switch -c camel-quarkus-main-456`.
//. Locate the project you are working with in the `antora-playbook.yml` under `sources`, and locate the branch you have altered under the appropriate `-url`.
//Leaving the original branch as a comment, alter the branch to e.g. `- pull/456` using the PR number you noted earlier.
//. Commit the change to the playbook, push it to your `camel-website` fork, and open a PR against `camel-website`.
//CI will build your change and, if successful, will deploy a preview on Netlify.
//There will be an email with the preview URL.
//. Check for build problems and examine the preview.
//. Upon approval, your content PR will be merged.
//Unless you have made a considerably more extensive change than described above, the `camel-website` PR will not need to be merged and may be closed.
//
//=== Currently usable workflow
. Commit and push your work and create a PR in the (sub)project repository.
. Fork/clone the camel-website repository, and create an appropriate branch, e.g. `git switch -c camel-quarkus-main-456`.
. Locate the project you are working with in the `antora-playbook.yml` under `sources`, and locate the branch you have altered under the appropriate `-url`.
.. Comment out the original source URL and replace it with the URL of your fork.
.. Leaving the original branch as a comment, alter the branch to e.g. `- main-doc-fix` using your branch name.
.. Make sure that all other branches used for the documentation are up to date in your fork.
To do this, for each such branch, execute
[source,console]
----
git switch <branch>
git pull
git push <fork>
----
. Commit the change to the playbook, push it to your `camel-website` fork, and open a PR against `camel-website`.
CI will build your change and, if successful, will deploy a preview on Netlify.
There will be an email with the preview URL.
. Check for build problems and examine the preview.
. Upon approval, your content PR will be merged.
Unless you have made a considerably more extensive change than described above, the `camel-website` PR will not need to be merged and may be closed.

[#_local_build_instructions]
== How to build the website locally, with your changes

First, make sure you have yarn, version >= 3.1.0, installed globally.

=== Directory layout and initial setup

You need a single directory, such as `camel`, that contains all the camel subprojects you are working with, and the `camel-website` project.

[source,console]
----
cd camel
git clone https://github.com/apache/camel-website.git
----

Unless you are on a linux system you will need to adjust the yarn cache/unplugged to work with your OS:

[source,console]
----
cd camel-website
yarn update:cache
----

Run a build against the remote source repos to check that it works and to build a local copy of the UI:

[source,console]
----
yarn build-all
----

=== Adjusting the playbook to include local changes

The Antora build is specified in the `camel-website/antora-playbook.yml` playbook.
The content repositories are specified under the `content/sources` key.
Locate the subproject you are working on and change the `url` to point to the local checkout of the subproject, e.g.

[source,yml]
----
#    - url: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus.git <1>
    - url: ./../camel-quarkus <2>
      branches:
        - main
        - 2.5.x
        - 2.4.x
      start_path: docs
----
<1> Leaving the original can help setting up the playbook for a PR build.
<2> This relative path depends on the organization of all your camel projects in a `camel` directory.

Your local changes will need to be on a branch, so change the branch name, e.g.

[source,yml]
----
#    - url: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus.git
    - url: ./../camel-quarkus
      branches:
#        - main
        - main-doc-fixes
        - 2.5.x
        - 2.4.x
      start_path: docs
----

Make sure that every branch used in the documentation is present locally and up to date.
In the subproject directory, for each branch, run e.g.

[source, console]
----
git switch 2.5.x
git pull
----

Now you are ready to build your work locally, in `camel-website`:

[source, console]
----
yarn build:antora
# or yarn build to include hugo content.
----

Note that Antora will use the file system state of your main checked-out branch, whether or not these changes are committed.
If you have additional git worktrees checked out, you can have Antora use the file system state of these also, see https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/playbook/content-worktrees/[the Antora worktrees documentation].

If you do a full build and have Docker available locally you can view your build served with httpd by running `local-httpd-in-docker.sh`.

== New, renamed, or removed pages

* Add, rename, or remove the xref for your page in the appropriate nav.adoc file.
* Build the entire website and check for broken xrefs: these will appear as errors in the Antora log output.

== Changed xrefs

First, read xref:#_a_guide_to_xrefs[]

* Build the entire website and check for broken xrefs.

== Adding a new component version

See xref:release-guide-website.adoc[].

== A guide to xrefs

For a general explanation of Antora xref syntax see https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/page/xref/[the Antora documentation].
Due to the logical structure of the Camel documentation, xrefs will have a very limited choice of structure.

IMPORTANT: A bit of confusion is possible here between Antora components and Camel components.
Generally an Antora component corresponds more or less to a Camel subproject, and never to a camel commponent.
All the camel components are documented in an Antora component named `components`.
In this section the word `component` means an Antora component.

IMPORTANT: Antora components may be `distributed` which means that the content comes from more than one place, possibly from different repositories.
For instance, the `components` component has content from the main camel repository under the start_paths `docs/components` and `core/camel-core-engine/src/main/docs` and from the `camel-spring-boot` repository under `components-starter` and `docs/components`.
Furthermore the content may not appear in the normal Antora structure but may be collected from a more maven-project-friendly arrangement with an Antora extension.

=== xrefs within an (Antora) component

Generally there will never be a reason to refer from one version of a component to another version.
To assure this happens without maintenance issues, leave out the version and component segments from the xref, e.g. in the `components` component

[source,adoc,subs=+attributes]
xref{blank}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[]

NOT

[source,adoc,subs=+attributes]
xref{blank}:next@components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[]

Do this no matter how many locations the component is distributed over.

An xref within the same module can leave out the module segment, although it does no harm.

Do not specify the component name: if you do, the link will be to the `latest` (non-prerelease, i.e., non-`next`) version, not the current version.

=== Links to the user manual

The user-manual component is https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.0/component-with-no-version/[unversioned].
Leave out the version segment.
For example, this will link to this page from anywhere in the documentation:

[source,adoc]
xref:manual::improving-the-documentation.adoc[]

=== Links between subprojects

Each camel subproject relates to other subprojects, and each version of a subproject relates to specific versions of these other subprojects.
These subproject versions are specified in the `antora.yml` component descriptor for the documentation component for that subproject.
Note that for distributed components each start path has a component descriptor but only one has the additional `asciidoc/attributes` key.
For example,

[source,yaml]
----
name: camel-kafka-connector
title: Camel Kafka Connector
version: next
prerelease: true
display-version: Next (Pre-release)

nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc

asciidoc:
  attributes:
    camel-version: 3.12.x
    camel-k-runtime-version: 1.8.0
    camel-k-version:
    camel-kamelets-version: 0.3.0
----

NOTE: Setting these up is WIP

Use these attributes to refer to documentation for the related subproject, e.g.

[source,adoc]
xref{blank}:{camel-version}@components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[]

If there's a missing attribute, raise an issue rather than using a concrete version.
