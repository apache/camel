= Routes

A Camel _route_ is where the integration flow is defined.
For example to integrate two systems then a Camel route can be _coded_ to specify how these systems are integrated.

An example could be to take files from a FTP server and send to a ActiveMQ messaging system.

This can be coded in a route using Java with the xref:java-dsl.adoc[Java DSL]

[source,java]
----
from("ftp:myserver/folder")
  .to("activemq:queue:cheese");
----

Camel support coding in other languages such as XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="ftp:myserver/folder"/>
  <to uri="activemq:queue:cheese"/>
</route>
----

== RouteBuilder with Java DSL

When coding routes with the xref:java-dsl.adoc[Java DSL] then you would use a xref:route-builder.adoc[`RouteBuilder`] classes where
you code the route in the `configure` method as shown:

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------
RouteBuilder builder = new RouteBuilder() {
    public void configure() {
        from("direct:a").to("direct:b");
    }
};
------------------------------------------------------

As you can see from the above Camel uses URIs to wire endpoints together.

=== Routes using Java lambda style

Camel now supports to define Camel routes in Java DSL using Lambda style. This can be beneficial for microservices or serverless where
you may want to quickly define a few routes.

For example using lambda style you can define a Camel route that takes messages from Kafka and send to JMS in a single line of code:

[source,java]
----
rb -> rb.from("kafka:cheese").to("jms:queue:foo");
----

There is a bit more to this as the lambda route must be coded in a Java method that returns an instance of `LambdaRouteBuilder`.
See more at the xref:lambda-route-builder.adoc[LambdaRouteBuilder] documentation.

== Route Precondition

The routes can be included or not according to the result of a test expressed in simple language that is evaluated only once during the initialization phase.

In the next example, the route is only included if the parameter `format` has been set to `xml`.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:in").precondition("'{{format}}' == 'xml'")
   .unmarshal().jaxb()
   .to("direct:out");
----

And the same example using XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route precondition="'{{format}}' == 'xml'">
  <from uri="direct:in"/>
  <unmarshal><jaxb/></unmarshal>
  <to uri="direct:out"/>
</route>
----

And in YAML DSL:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    precondition: "'{{format}}' == 'xml'"
    from:
      uri: "direct:in"
      steps:
        - unmarshal:
            jaxb: {}
        - to: "direct:out"
----
