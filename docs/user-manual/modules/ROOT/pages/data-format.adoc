Camel supports a pluggable `DataFormat` to allow messages to be marshalled
to and from binary or text formats to support a kind of
xref:components:eips:message-translator.adoc[Message Translator].

Camel has support for message transformation using several techniques.
One such technique is data formats, where marshal and unmarshal comes from.

So in other words the xref:components:eips:marshal-eip.adoc[Marshal] and
xref:components:eips:unmarshal-eip.adoc[Unmarshal] EIPs
are used data formats.

- _Marshal_ - Transforms the message body (such as Java object) into a binary or textual format, ready to be wired over the network.
- _Unmarshal_ - Transforms data in some binary or textual format (such as received over the network)
into a Java object; or some other representation according to the data format being used.

== Supported data formats

There are more than 40 different data formats that
supports formats such as XML, CSV, JSon, YAML, Avro, Protobuf, and many more.
