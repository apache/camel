= Endpoint DSL

Endpoint-DSL is a builder API that allows using type-safe endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URL] configurations.

The Endpoint DSL is exclusively available as part of the Java DSL.

The DSL can be accessed in several ways, but the main one is to switch to using an `EndpointRouteBuilder` instead of the usual
`RouteBuilder`. This builder provides access to all of Camel endpoint builders which are defined through inheritance on the `org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.EndpointRouteBuilder`.

== Using Endpoint DSL

The following is an example of an FTP route using the standard `RouteBuilder` Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("ftp://foo@myserver?password=secret&recursive=true&" +
                "ftpClient.dataTimeout=30000&" +
                "ftpClientConfig.serverLanguageCode=fr")
                .to("bean:doSomething");
    }
}
----

The same Java statement can be rewritten in the following more type-safe and readable way using
the new `EndpointRouteBuilder` that allows using the Endpoint-DSL:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends EndpointRouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from(ftp("myserver").account("foo").password("secret").recursive(true)
            .advanced()
                .ftpClientParameters(Collections.singletonMap("dataTimeout", 30000))
                .ftpClientConfig(Collections.singletonMap("serverLanguageCode", "fr")))
            .to(bean("something"));
    }
}
----

=== Type Safety

Similar to the xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], uses the meta-model, which is extracted from the source and
written in various JSON files, to generate a fluent DSL for each component. This fluent DSL provides type safety for parameters.

=== Using custom component names

The Endpoint-DSL uses the default name of the xref:component.adoc[Component], so in the example above the name is `ftp`.
There can be use-cases where you may have multiple Camel xref:components::index.adoc[components] of the same type registered with different names.
An example is if you have two JMS broker systems (for example ActiveMQ and WebSphereMQ).

Then you can set up two Camel JMS components with unique names such as: `myAMQ` and `myWMQ`

The Endpoint-DSL can use these names with the `jms` fluent builder as shown:

[source,java]
----
from(jms("myWMQ", "cheese").concurrentConsumers(5))
    .to(jms("myAMQ", "smelly"));
----

Notice how we can refer to their names as the first parameter in the `jms` fluent builder.
The example would then consume messages from WebSphereMQ queue named cheese and route to ActiveMQ on a queue named smelly.

=== Headers' name

The endpoint-dsl can also be used to be assisted when selecting the name of a header to set or to get. The headers' name builder
is accessible directly from the method of the class `EndpointRouteBuilder` without argument whose name is the scheme of
the target component.

In the example below the method `file()` available from `EndpointRouteBuilder`, gives access to the methods corresponding to the name of the headers of the file component. Here the method `fileName()` is called to get the name of the header for the name of the file.

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends EndpointRouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from(/*some endpoint*/)
            // Some route start
            .setHeader(file().fileName(), constant("foo.txt"))
            // Some route end
            ;
    }
}
----

=== Using Endpoint-DSL outside route builders

You can use the type-safe endpoint-dsl outside route builders with:

* With the `FluentProducerTemplate` to send messages
* Creating an `Endpoint`

For example to send a message to Kafka you can use the `FluentProducerTemplate`

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.kafka;

context.createFluentProducerTemplate()
    .to(kafka("start").clientId("myClient").brokers("{{myBrokers}}").partitionKey("myKey"))
    .withBody("Hello World")
    .send();
----

To use the endpoint-dsl with kafka you need to static import `kafka` from the class:
`org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders` which has all the Camel components.

An endpoint can also be created in Java code via the endpoint-dsl as shown:

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.paho;

Endpoint mqtt = paho("sensor").clientId("myClient").userName("scott").password("tiger")
    .resolve(context);
----

You can then set all the options via the type-safe DSL and then the endpoint can be resolved (created)
by calling `resolve` with `CamelContext` as parameter.

If you want to inject an endpoint into your POJO or `RouteBuilder` class using endpoint-dsl, then
this can be done similar to the previous example, but with one important difference:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry;
import org.apache.camel.EndpointInject;
import org.apache.camel.Produce;
import org.apache.camel.builder.EndpointProducerBuilder;
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.paho;

@BindToRegistry
public class MyPojo {

    @Produce
    private FluentProducerTemplate producer;

    private final EndpointProducerBuilder mqtt = paho("sensor").clientId("myClient").userName("scott").password("tiger");

    public void sendToSensor(String data) {
        producer.withBody(data).to(mqtt).send();
    }

}
----

The `MyPojo` is a class that with standalone Camel can be discovered and registered with the `@BindToRegistry` annotation.
If you use Spring Boot, or Quarkus etc then you should use their kind of annotations for this.

That's not the point of this example, it is the Endpoint DSL to configure the MQTT endpoint (camel-paho).
The endpoint is configured the same way as before by the type-safe endpoint-dsl by static importing the `paho`,
and then use its fluent builder methods to configure. Notice how the returned type is `EndpointProducerBuilder`.
That type is not an `Endpoint` instance as it's not resolved (i.e. it's only a builder for an endpoint).
This means that the builder can be code and compiled before `CamelContext` is created and started.

At runtime, we want to use this endpoint to send messages to MQTT server; this is done in the `sendToSensor`
method where we are using `FluentProducerTemplate` that is capable of using the `EndpointProducerBuilder` as
the endpoint in shown with: `.to(mqtt)`.


== Dependency

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-endpointdsl</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
