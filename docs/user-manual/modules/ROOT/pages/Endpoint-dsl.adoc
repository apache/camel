[[Endpoint-DSL]]
= Endpoint DSL

Endpoint-dsl is a new API that allows using type-safe endpoint URL configurations.

The following is an example of an FTP route using the standard `RouteBuilder`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("ftp://foo@myserver?password=secret&recursive=true&
               ftpClient.dataTimeout=30000&
               ftpClientConfig.serverLanguageCode=fr")
        .to("bean:doSomething");
    }
}
----

The same Java statement can be rewritten in the following more readable way using
the new `EndpointRouteBuilder` that allows using the endpoint DSL:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRoutes extends EndpointRouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from(ftp("myserver").account("foo").password("secret").recursive(true)
            .advanced()
                .ftpClientParameters(Collections.singletonMap("dataTimeout", 30000))
                .ftpClientConfig(Collections.singletonMap("serverLanguageCode", "fr")))
            .to(bean("something"));
    }
}
----

== The fluent DSL now provides type safety for parameters

The above example of endpoint-dsl uses the meta model, which is  extracted from the source using an annotation processor and
written in various JSON files, to generate a fluent DSL for each endpoint.This fluent DSL provides type safety for parameters.
It further allows leveraging the Java editor code completion to access the list of available parameters for the each endpoint.

== Using custom component names

The endpoint-dsl uses the default name of the component, so in the example above the name is `ftp`.
There can be use-cases where you may have multiple Camel components of the same type registered with different names.
An example is if you have two JMS broker systems (for example ActiveMQ and WebSphereMQ).

Then you can setup two Camel JMS components with unique names such as: `myAMQ` and `myWMQ`

The endpoint-dsl can use these names with the `jms` fluent builder as shown:

[source,java]
----
from(jms("myWMQ", "cheese").concurrentConsumers(5))
    .to(jms("myAMQ", "smelly"));
----

Notice how we can refer to their names as the first parameter in the `jms` fluent builder.
The example would then consume messages from WebSphereMQ queue named cheese and route to ActiveMQ on a queue named smelly.

== Using endpoint-dsl outside route builders

You can use the type-safe endpoint-dsl outside route builders with:

* With the `FluentProducerTemplate` to send messages
* Creating an `Endpoint`

For example to send a message to Kafka you can use the `FluentProducerTemplate`

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.kafka;

context.createFluentProducerTemplate()
    .to(kafka("start").clientId("myClient").brokers("{{myBrokers}}").partitionKey("myKey"))
    .withBody("Hello World")
    .send();
----

To use the endpoint-dsl with kafka you need to static import `kafka` from the class:
`org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders` which has all the Camel components.

An endpoint can also be created in Java code via the endpoint-dsl as shown:

[source,java]
----
import static org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.StaticEndpointBuilders.paho;

Endpoint mqtt = paho("sensor").clientId("myClient").userName("scott").password("tiger")
    .resolve(context);
----

You can then set all the options via the type-safe DSL and then the endpoint can be resolved (created)
by calling `resolve` with `CamelContext` as parameter.

== How to use

The DSL can be accessed in several ways, but the main one is to switch to using an `EndpointRouteBuilder` instead of the usual 
`RouteBuilder`.  It provides access to all endpoint builders which are defined through inheritance on the `org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.EndpointRouteBuilder`.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-endpointdsl</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
