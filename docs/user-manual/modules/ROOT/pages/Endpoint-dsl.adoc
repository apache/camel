[[ENDPOINT-DSL]]
= ENDPOINT DSL

Endpoint-dsl is a new API that is created to replace already being used URLs to designate the consumer or producer endpoints.

== How Endpoint-dsl is better than URLs?

=== Simple and easy to read/understand 

The following is an example of an FTP consumer endpoint definition:

from("ftp://foo@myserver?password=secret&

           recursive=true&

           ftpClient.dataTimeout=30000&

           ftpClientConfig.serverLanguageCode=fr")

    .to("bean:doSomething");

The same java statement can be rewritten in the following more readable way:

from(ftp("myserver").account("foo")

        .password("secret")

        .recursive(true)

        .advanced()

        .ftpClientParameters(

            Collections.singletonMap("dataTimeout", 30000))

        .ftpClientConfig(

            Collections.singletonMap("serverLanguageCode", "fr")))

    .to(bean("something"));

=== The fluent DSL now provides type safety for parameters :
The above example of endpoint-dsl uses the meta model, which is  extracted from the source using an annotation processor and
written in various JSON files, to generate a fluent DSL for each endpoint.This fluent DSL provides type safety for parameters.
It further allows leveraging the java editor code completion to access the list of available parameters for the each endpoint.

== How to access?

The DSL can be accessed in several ways, but the main one is to switch to using an EndpointRouteBuilder instead of the usual 
RouteBuilder.  It provides access to all endpoint builders which are defined through inheritance on the EndpointRouteBuilder.
