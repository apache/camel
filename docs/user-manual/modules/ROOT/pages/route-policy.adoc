= RoutePolicy

A route policy `org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy` is used to control
route(s) at runtime. For example, you can use it to determine whether a
route should be running or not. However, the policies can support any
kind of use cases.

== How it works

You associate a route with a given `RoutePolicy` and then during
runtime Camel will invoke callbacks on this policy where you can
implement your custom logic. Camel provides a support class that is a
good base class to extend `org.apache.camel.support.RoutePolicySupport`.

There are these callbacks invoked:

* `onInit`
* `onRemove`
* `onStart`
* `onStop`
* `onSuspend`
* `onResume`
* `onExchangeBegin`
* `onExchangeDone`

See the Javadoc of the `org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy` for more
details; and also the implementation of the
`org.apache.camel.throttling.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` for a concrete
example.

Camel provides the following policies out of the box:

* `org.apache.camel.throttling.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` - a throttling
based policy that automatic suspends/resumes route(s) based on metrics
from the current in flight exchanges. You can use this to dynamically
throttle e.g. a xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS] consumer, to avoid it consuming too
fast.

* `org.apache.camel.throttling.ThrottlingExceptionRoutePolicy` - a throttling
based policy modeled after the circuit breaker. This policy will stop consuming
from an endpoint based on the type of exceptions that are thrown and the threshold setting.

Camel also provides an ability to schedule routes to
be activated, deactivated, suspended and/or resumed at certain times
during the day using a
xref:scheduledroutepolicy.adoc[ScheduledRoutePolicy] (offered via the
xref:components::quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] component).

== SuspendableService

If you want to dynamic suspend/resume routes then it is advised to
use `SuspendableService` as it allows for fine-grained
suspend and resume operations.

== `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`

The *`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`* is triggered when an
xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is complete, which means that it requires
at least one xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] to be complete before it
_works_.

The throttling inflight route policy has the following options:

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===

|Option |Default |Description

|`scope` |`Route` |A scope for either `Route` or `Context` which defines if the current
number of inflight exchanges is context based or for that particular
route.

|`maxInflightExchanges` |`1000` |The maximum threshold when the throttling will start to suspend the
route if the current number of inflight exchanges is higher than this
value.

|`resumePercentOfMax` |`70` |A percentage `0..100` which defines when the throttling should resume
again in case it has been suspended.

|`loggingLevel` |`INFO` |The logging level used for logging the throttling activity.

|`logger` |`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` |The logger category.
|===

=== ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy compared to the Throttler EIP

The `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` compared to
xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP is that it does *not* block during
throttling. It does throttling that is approximate based, meaning that
its more coarse grained and not explicit precise as the
xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP.

The xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP can
be much more accurate and only allow a specific number of messages being
passed per a given time unit. Also the `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`
is based its metrics on number of inflight exchanges where as
xref:components:eips:throttle-eip.adoc[Throttler] EIP is based on number o
messages per time unit.

== ScheduledRoutePolicy

See xref:scheduledroutepolicy.adoc[Scheduled Route Policy] for scheduling based route policy.

== Using route policies in Camel routes

You configure the route policy as follows from Java DSL, using the
`routePolicy` method:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
RoutePolicy myPolicy = new MyRoutePolicy();

from("seda:foo").routePolicy(myPolicy).to("mock:result");
-----------------------------------------------------------

In Spring XML you configure using the `routePolictRef` attribute on `<route>` as shown:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="myPolicy" class="com.mycompany.MyRoutePolicy"/>
   
<route routePolicyRef="myPolicy">
    <from uri="seda:foo"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
---------------------------------------------------------

You can configure one or more route policies (separated by comma), such as:

[source,java]
----
from("seda:foo").routePolicy(myPolicy, myOtherPolicy).to("mock:result");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------------------------
<route routePolicyRef="myPolicy,myOtherPolicy">
    <from uri="seda:foo"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
---------------------------------------------------------

== Using RoutePolicyFactory

If you want to use a route policy for every route, you can use
a `org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicyFactory` as a factory for creating
a `RoutePolicy` instance for each route. This can be used when you
want to use the same kind of route policy for all or some routes.

With the factory you only need to configure this once, and every route created will
have the policy assigned.

There is API on `CamelContext` to add a factory, as shown below

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------
context.addRoutePolicyFactory(new MyRoutePolicyFactory());
----------------------------------------------------------

And from XML DSL you just define a `<bean>` with the factory, and Camel will automatically detect this factory:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="myRoutePolicyFactory" class="com.foo.MyRoutePolicyFactory"/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can have as many route policy factories as you want, so if you have two factories,
you can just add them both as shown:

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------
context.addRoutePolicyFactory(new MyRoutePolicyFactory());
context.addRoutePolicyFactory(new MyOtherRoutePolicyFactory());
----------------------------------------------------------

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="myRoutePolicyFactory" class="com.foo.MyRoutePolicyFactory"/>
<bean id="myOtherRoutePolicyFactory" class="com.foo.MyOtherRoutePolicyFactory"/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
