[[ExchangePattern-ExchangePattern]]
= Exchange Pattern

There are two _Message Exchange Patterns_ you can use in
messaging.

From there xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] they are:

* xref:{eip-vc}:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Message] (or one-way)
* xref:{eip-vc}:eips:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request Reply]

In Camel we have an
`org.apache.camel.ExchangePattern`
enumeration which can be configured on the *exchangePattern* property on
the Message Exchange indicating if a message
exchange is a one way xref:{eip-vc}:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Message] (*InOnly*) or
a xref:{eip-vc}:eips:requestReply-eip.adoc[Request Reply] message exchange (*InOut*).

For example to override the default pattern on a xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS]
endpoint you could use the `exchangePattern` parameter in the Endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URI]
as shown:

[source,text]
----
jms:myQueue?exchangePattern=InOut
