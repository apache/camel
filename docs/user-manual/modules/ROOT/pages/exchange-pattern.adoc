[[ExchangePattern-ExchangePattern]]
= Exchange Pattern

There are many different _Message Exchange Patterns_ you can use in
messaging. This concept is also demonstrated in WSDL and JBI's MEPs.

From there xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] the common examples are

* Request Reply
* Event Message (or one way)

In Camel we have an
`org.apache.camel.ExchangePattern`
enumeration which can be configured on the *exchangePattern* property on
the Message Exchange indicating if a message
exchange is a one way Event Message (InOnly) or
a Request Reply message exchange (InOut).

For example to override the default pattern on a xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS]
endpoint you could use this URI

[source,java]

jms:MyQueue?exchangePattern=InOut
