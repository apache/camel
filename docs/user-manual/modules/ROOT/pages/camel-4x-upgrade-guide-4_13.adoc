= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

[NOTE]
====
https://github.com/apache/camel-upgrade-recipes/[The Camel Upgrade Recipes project] provides automated assistance for some common migration tasks.
Note that manual migration is still required.
See the xref:camel-upgrade-recipes-tool.adoc[documentation] page for details.

== Upgrading Camel 4.12 to 4.13

=== camel-core

Added a 2nd `lookup` method to `org.apache.camel.spi.TypeConverterRegistry` and changed the `addConverter` to no longer have
an empty default noop implementation in the interface.

The class `org.apache.camel.util.backoff.BackOffTimer` has been refactored as an interface,
and the basic implementation is `org.apache.camel.util.backoff.SimpleBackOffTimer` in `camel-util` JAR.

To get hold of a `BackOffTimer` then use the new factory as shown below:

[source,java]
----
BackOffTimer timer = PluginHelper.getBackOffTimerFactory(camelContext.getCamelContextExtension())
    .newBackOffTimer("NameOfTimer", executorService);
----

The `BackOffTimer` is mostly used internally in Camel components to conduct tasks that should
be repeated until completed, such as recovery tasks. And as such this refactor is not
expected to impact Camel end users.

Added `CamelContext` as first parameter to the `run` method(s) in `org.apache.camel.support.task.BlockingTask`.
The `org.apache.camel.support.task.BackgroundTask` is changed to use a fixed delay between runs, which
is similar to `BackOffTimer`.

=== camel-file / camel-ftp / camel-smb / camel-azure-files

When using `poll` or `pollEnrich` with the file based components, then the `eagerLimitMaxMessagesPerPoll` option
has changed default from `false` to `true`. Only use-cases where you need to sort the files first,
requires to explicit set the option `eagerMaxMessagesPerPoll=false` to make Camel scan for all files first before sorting,
and then `poll` or `pollEnrich` will then pick the top file after the sorting.

This improves performance for use-cases without need for sorting first.

The consumers (`camel-ftp`, `camel-smb`, and `camel-azure-files`) will now in case of failure to create starting directory,
on startup, keep attempting to create the directory on polling, until its successfully created.
Previously in case of error creating the starting directory then this could cause the consumer to not be able to recover,
and you would have to restart the route to attempt again.

=== camel-http

Renamed class `org.apache.camel.component.http.BasicAuthenticationHttpClientConfigurer` to `org.apache.camel.component.http.DefaultAuthenticationHttpClientConfigurer`.

=== camel-language

If using a header to provide a custom script, then this must now be turned on via `allowTemplateFromHeader=true` on the endpoint or component.

=== camel-salesforce

`initialReplyIdTimeout` is now deprecated and it will be removed in a future release. Pub/sub replay ids are no longer checked at
startup: when the client subscribes, if the replay id is invalid, an error is raised. To handle the error you can use a specific
`ExceptionHandler` or you can set `fallbackToLatestReplayId` to `true` in order to make the consumer start from the
latest event.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

The deprecated kebab-case has been removed.
For example `set-body` and `set-header` should be `setBody` / `setHeader` etc.

=== template components

The following components has corrected `contentCache` option to be default true. For most this was already the case,
but the documentation was mistakenly defined as `false`. We also added `contentCache` on component level,
so this can be configured globally.

- camel-chunk
- camel-freemarker
- camel-jolt
- camel-jslt
- camel-json-patch
- camel-json-validator
- camel-jsonata
- camel-jte
- camel-language
- camel-mustache
- camel-mvel
- camel-robotframework
- camel-stringtemplate
- camel-thymeleaf
- camel-velocity

Also, most of the components above supports using a header to provide a custom template, then this must now be turned on via `allowTemplateFromHeader=true` on the endpoint or component.

=== Camel Spring Boot

Remove the deprecated `camel.springboot.xxx` configuration syntax. Use `camel.main.xxx` syntax
which is standard across all runtimes.

=== camel-fury

Camel Fury dataformat has been renamed camel-fory, this is valid for all the component elements: scheme, DSL and documentation.
