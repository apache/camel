= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.12 to 4.13

=== camel-core

Added a 2nd `lookup` method to `org.apache.camel.spi.TypeConverterRegistry` and changed the `addConverter` to no longer have
an empty default noop implementation in the interface.

=== camel-http

Renamed class `org.apache.camel.component.http.BasicAuthenticationHttpClientConfigurer` to `org.apache.camel.component.http.DefaultAuthenticationHttpClientConfigurer`.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

The deprecated kebab-case has been removed.
For example `set-body` and `set-header` should be `setBody` / `setHeader` etc.

== Camel Spring Boot

Remove the deprecated `camel.springboot.xxx` configuration syntax. Use `camel.main.xxx` syntax
which is standard across all runtimes.
