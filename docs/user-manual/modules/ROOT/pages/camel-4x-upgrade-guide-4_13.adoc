= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.12 to 4.13

=== camel-core

Added a 2nd `lookup` method to `org.apache.camel.spi.TypeConverterRegistry` and changed the `addConverter` to no longer have
an empty default noop implementation in the interface.

=== camel-http

Renamed class `org.apache.camel.component.http.BasicAuthenticationHttpClientConfigurer` to `org.apache.camel.component.http.DefaultAuthenticationHttpClientConfigurer`.
