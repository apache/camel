= Testing

Testing is a crucial activity in any piece of software development or
integration. Typically, Camel users would use various different
technologies wired together in a variety of EIPs with different
endpoints, languages, bean integration, and
dependency injection, so it's very easy
for things to go wrong!. Testing is the crucial weapon to ensure
that things work as you would expect.

Camel is a Java library, so you can easily wire up tests in JUnit.
However, the Camel project has tried to make the testing of Camel as easy
and powerful as possible, so we have introduced the following features.

== Testing modules

The following modules are supported:

[width="100%",cols="1m,4",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Component |Description

|xref:components:others:test-junit5.adoc[camel-test-junit5] |*JUnit 5*: Is an older standalone Java
library letting you easily create Camel test cases using a single Java
class for all your configuration and routing without.
|xref:components:others:test-main-junit5.adoc[camel-test-main-junit5] | *JUnit 5*: Used for testing Camel in Camel Main mode

|xref:components:others:test-spring-junit5.adoc[camel-test-spring-junit5] | *JUnit 5*: Used for testing Camel with Spring / Spring Boot

|xref:test-infra.adoc[camel-test-infra] | *Camel Test Infra*: Camel Test Infra is a set of modules that leverage modern JUnit 5 features to abstract the provisioning and execution of test infrastructure. Among other things, it provides abstraction of the infrastructure (based on Test Containers - being the de-facto successor of the camel-testcontainers components) as well as JUnit 5 extensions for the Camel Context itself.

|=======================================================================

NOTE: If you are using Camel Quarkus then you can find information in
its documentation how to do testing with Quarkus and Camel.

In all approaches the test classes look pretty much the same in that
they all reuse the xref:bean-integration.adoc[Camel binding and
injection annotations].

TIP: For more details on the different testing modules, then see their respective documentation
from the links in the table above.

== Testing functionality

Camel provides a set of features that are common to use when writing unit or integration tests with Camel.

=== Testing endpoints

Camel provides a number of xref:endpoint.adoc[endpoints] which can make testing easier.

[width="100%",cols="1,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
|xref:components::mock-component.adoc[Mock] |For testing routes and mediation rules using
mocks and allowing assertions to be added to an endpoint.

|xref:components::dataset-component.adoc[DataSet] |For load & soak testing this endpoint
provides a way to create huge numbers of messages for sending to
components and asserting that they are consumed correctly.

|xref:components::dataset-test-component.adoc[DataSet Test] |Used for automatic load
a set of expected message from another endpoint which is then compared to the messages
that arrives at this endpoint.

|=======================================================================

The main endpoint is the xref:components::mock-component.adoc[Mock] endpoint which allows
expectations to be added to different endpoints; you can then run your
tests and assert that your expectations are met at the end.

=== Stubbing out physical transport technologies

If you wish to test out a route but want to avoid actually using real physical transport
(for example to unit test a transformation route
rather than performing a full integration test) then the following
endpoints can be useful:

[width="100%",cols="1,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
|xref:components::direct-component.adoc[Direct] |Direct invocation of the consumer from the
producer so that single threaded (non-SEDA) in VM invocation is
performed which can be useful to mock out physical transports

|xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] |Deliver messages asynchronously to consumers via
a `BlockingQueue` which is good for testing asynchronous transports

|xref:components::stub-component.adoc[Stub] |Works like xref:components::stub-component.adoc[SEDA] but does not
validate the endpoint URI, which makes stubbing very easy.
|=======================================================================

=== Testing existing routes

Camel provides some features to aid during testing of existing routes
where you cannot or will not use xref:components::mock-component.adoc[Mock] etc.
For example, you may have a production ready route which you want to test with some
3rd party API which sends messages into this route.

[width="100%",cols="1,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
|xref:notify-builder.adoc[NotifyBuilder] |Allows you to be notified when
a certain condition has occurred. For example when the route has
completed 5 messages. You can build complex expressions to match your
criteria when to be notified.

|xref:advice-with.adoc[AdviceWith] |Allows you to _advice_ (enhance)
an existing route using a xref:route-builder.adoc[RouteBuilder] style.
For example, you can send (or send and skip) message to a xref:components::mock-component.adoc[Mock]
endpoint for validating the message send by Camel is as expected.
|=======================================================================

=== Third Party Testing libraries

There are a number of third party testing libraries that Camel users have found useful.

[width="100%",cols="1,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
| https://citrusframework.org/[Citrus Integration Framework] | Framework for automated integration tests supporting a wide range of message protocols and data formats
| https://citrusframework.org/yaks/[Citrus Yaks] | YAKS is a framework to enable Cloud Native BDD testing on Kubernetes
