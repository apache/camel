== Upgrading Camel 4.17 to 4.18

=== camel-simple

The *simple* language has deprecated binary operators that uses space in the name:

- `not contains` use `!contains` instead
- `not regex` use `!regex` instead
- `not range` use `!range` instead
- `starts with` use `startsWith` instead
- `ends with` use `endsWith` instead

=== camel-file

The `org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileOperations` has added method `storeFileDirectly`.

=== Component deprecation

The `camel-olingo2` and `camel-olingo4` component are deprecated.
This is due the Apache Olingo project is EOL and has been moved to the attic and is no longer maintained.
