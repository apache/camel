= Camel JBang

A JBang-based Camel app for easily running Camel routes.

The `camel-jbang` is available from *Camel 3.12* and newer versions.

== Installation

It is not necessary to install Camel JBang. However, if you prefer to do so, JBang makes it easy for us by providing an installation feature that works with Github. If you have JBang installed on your system, then you can run the following command to install CamelJBang:

[source,bash]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

*Note*: up to Camel 3.14, the app was named `CamelJBang`. From 3.15 and newer, the app is named `camel`. It is still possible to use the older name by installing it using `CamelJBang@apache/camel` but this approach is deprecated and should not be used in the future.

== Using Camel JBang

The CamelJBang supports multiple commands. Running the command below, will print all of them:

[source,bash]
----
jbang camel@apache/camel [command]
----

*Note*: the first time you run this command, it may cause dependencies to be cached, therefore taking a few extra seconds to run.

All the commands support the `--help` and will display the appropriate help if that flag is provided.

However if you have installed CamelJBang with `jbang app install` then you can use `CamelJBang` instead of `jbang camel@apache/camel`

=== Troubleshooting

When using https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] then JBang stores state in `~/.jbang` directory.
This is also the location where JBang stores downloaded JARs.

So if you find problems with JBang using what is seems like an outdated JAR, then you can
try to delete this directory, or parts of it.

=== Using a specific Camel version

You can specify which Camel version to run as shown:

[source,bash]
----
jbang -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.14.0 camel@apache/camel [command]
----

== Running Routes

You can run Camel routes from any of the supported xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] in Camel such as YAML, XML, Java, Groovy.

For example to run YAML-based routes which also refer to Kamelets in the catalog.
In order to do so, write a YAML-based file with the `route`, the `steps` and the `to` destination for the route. The following example, shows a route that uses the Timer Source Kamelet to produce messages every second. The body of the messages will be logged to the standard output. Subsequently, they will be sent to a AMQP 1.0 compliant broker using the JMS AMQ 1.0 Sink Kamelet.

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    id: "hello"
    from:
      uri: "kamelet:timer-source"
      parameters:
        period: 1000
        message: "Hello Camel JBang"
      steps:
        - log: "${body}"
        - to:
            uri: "kamelet:jms-amqp-10-sink"
            parameters:
              remoteURI: amqp://localhost:61616
              destinationName: test-queue
----

Execute the following command to run this route:

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml
----

NOTE: it is necessary to have a AMQP 1.0 broker, such as Apache Artemis, running locally and listening on port 61616. Adjust the route accordingly if using a different address for the broker.

=== Running Routes from multiple files

You can run more than 1 file, for example to run two YAML files you can do:

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run one.yaml two.yaml
----

You can also mix different xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] such as yaml and Java:

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run one.yaml hello.java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the yaml files:

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run *.yaml
----

Or you can run all files starting with foo*

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run foo*
----

TIP: The run goal can also detect files that are `properties`.

=== Live reload

You can enable live reload of the route(s) when the source file is updated (saved),
using the `--reload` options as shown:

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml --reload
----

Then while the Camel application is running, you can update the YAML route and update when saving.

NOTE: The live reload is meant for development purposes, and if you encounter problems with reloading
such as JVM class loading issues, then you may need to restart the application.

=== Running routes hosted on GitHub

You can run a route that is hosted on GitHub using Camels xref:components:others:resourceresolver-github.adoc[github] resource loader.

For example to run one of the Camel K examples you can do:

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run run github:apache:camel-k:examples/languages/routes.yaml
----

=== Running local Kamelets

You can also use Camel JBang to try local Kamelets, without the need to publish them on Github or package them in a jar.

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run --local-kamelet-dir=/path/to/local/kamelets earthquake.yaml
----

=== Running Camel K integrations or bindings

Camel also supports running Camel K integrations and binding files, which are in CRD format (Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions).

For example a kamelet binding file named `joke.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 2000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
    properties:
      show-headers: false
----

Can be run with CamelJBang:

[source,bash]
----
CamelJBang run joke.yaml
----

=== Using platform-http component

When a route is started from `platform-http` then CamelJBang will automatically include a VertX HTTP server
running on port 8080. For example the following route in a file named `server.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "platform-http:/hello"
    steps:
      - set-body:
          constant: "Hello World"
----

Can be run with

[source,bash]
----
camel run server.yaml
----

And you can call the HTTP service with:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello World%
----

=== Debugging

You can debug both camel@apache/camel and your integration scripts by making use of the `--debug` flag provided by JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel --debug run /path/to/integration.java
[jbang] Building jar...
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

As you can see the default listening port is 4004 but can be configured as described in https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/debugging.html[JBang Debugging].

=== Search

You can use the CLI to search for kamelets, components, languages and miscellaneous components (others). Running the following command will present a list of items that can be searched:

[source,bash]
----
camel search --help
----

For example, to search for kamelets named `jms`, you can use:

[source,bash]
----
camel search kamelets --search-term=jms
----

To list all the kamelets, just run the command without any search term:

[source,bash]
----
camel search kamelets
----


The same behavior also works for all the other search commands. The table below lists all search commands available at the moment:

|===
|Command |Description

|kamelets
|search for kamelets

|components
|search for components

|languages
|search for languages

|others
|search for miscellaneous components

|===


=== Init Kamelets

The init sub-command can be used to simplify creating Kamelets. Through this command, it is possible to create new Kamelets through pre-configured templates. It works in two steps: first it is necessary to bootstrap the Kamelet by creating a properties file with the parameters necessary to create the Kamelet. Once the properties file is correctly set, then it is possible to create a pre-filled Kamelet by processing that properties file.

To bootstrap the Kamelet run:

[source,bash]
----
camel init kamelet --bootstrap
----

This will create a sub-directory called `work` in the current directory with a properties file named `init-template.properties` inside it.

The keys of the properties file are commented with the details about what need to be filled in order to generate the Kamelet. If a value is missing, it will be ignored when generating the Kamelet and will need to be filled in manually later.

After you have filled the values, you can generate the Kamelet using:

[source,bash]
----
camel init kamelet --properties-path work/init-template.properties
----

Running this command will create a new file in the `work` directory. The name of the generated file is determined by the `kameletMetadataName` property in the properties file. As such, parsing the default properties file would generate a file named `my-sample-sink.kamelet.yaml` in the directory.

After the file is generated, it may still need to require final adjustments, such as correctly setting the name, the icon and other requirements for official Kamelets. Please consult the Kamelet development documentation for updated details.


=== Init Bindings

The init sub-command can also be used to simplify creating Kamelets bindings. Through this command, it is possible to create new bindings through pre-configured templates. Use the  `--kamelet` option (you can list the available ones using the search command) to set the Kamelet to generate the binding for.

To execute this feature run:

[source,bash]
----
camel init binding --destination /path/to/destination/directory/ --kamelet sftp-source
----

This will create a new sample YAML binding file that can be modified and used in Camel K.

You can also generate bindings that can be run by CamelJBang or Camel Core, but setting the `--project` option:

[source,bash]
----
camel init binding --destination /path/to/destination/directory/ --kamelet sftp-source --project core
----

=== Create Project

The create project command can be used to generate a maven project. After running the integration with the `run` command `create project` will generate a maven quarkus project with some required dependencies that can be used as a starting point for complex integrations. 

To execute this feature run:

[source,bash]
----
jbang camel@apache/camel create project integration.java integration.yaml integration.xml
----

this command generates a folder named CamelJBang that contains the quarkus project, in order to execute it the following command can be run:

[source,bash]
----
cd CamelJBang
mvn compile quarkus:dev
----

The table below lists all the command line options configurable on the `create project` command:

|===
|Option |Description

|name
|The name of the Camel application (artifactId and folder)

|group-id
|The group ID of the maven project

|directory
|Directory where the project will be created

|quarkus-dependency
|Comma separated list of camel-quarkus dependencies

|quarkus-bom-version
|Override quarkus bom version in pom.xml

|===
