= Camel JBang

A JBang-based Camel app for easily running Camel routes.

== Installation

It is not necessary to install Camel JBang. However, if you prefer to do so, JBang makes it easy for us by providing an installation feature that works with Github. If you have JBang installed on your system, then you can run the following command to install CamelJBang:

[source,bash]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

== Using Camel JBang

The CamelJBang supports multiple commands. Running the command below, will print all of them:

[source,bash]
----
jbang camel@apache/camel [command]
----

TIP: The first time you run this command, it may cause dependencies to be cached, therefore taking a few extra seconds to run.

All the commands support the `--help` and will display the appropriate help if that flag is provided.


=== Using a specific Camel version

You can specify which Camel version to run as shown:

[source,bash]
----
jbang run -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.16.0 camel@apache/camel [command]
----

And you can also try bleeding edge development by using SNAPSHOT such as:

[source,bash]
----
jbang run -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.17.0-SNAPSHOT camel@apache/camel [command]
----

== Creating and running Camel routes

You can create a new basic routes with the `init` command.

For example to create an XML route you do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init cheese.xml
----

Which creates the file `cheese.xml` with a sample route.

To run the file, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run cheese.xml
----

NOTE: You can create and run any of the supported xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] in Camel such as YAML, XML, Java, Groovy.

To create a new .java integration, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java
----

=== Running Routes from multiple files

You can run more than 1 file, for example to run two YAML files you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml two.yaml
----

You can also mix different xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] such as yaml and Java:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml hello.java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the yaml files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *.yaml
----

Or you can run all files starting with foo*

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo*
----

TIP: The run goal can also detect files that are `properties`.

=== Dev mode with live reload

You can enable dev mode that comes with live reload of the route(s) when the source file is updated (saved),
using the `--dev` options as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml --dev
----

Then while the Camel application is running, you can update the YAML route and update when saving.

NOTE: The live reload is meant for development purposes, and if you encounter problems with reloading
such as JVM class loading issues, then you may need to restart the application.

=== Running routes hosted on GitHub

You can run a route that is hosted on GitHub using Camels xref:components:others:resourceresolver-github.adoc[github] resource loader.

For example to run one of the Camel K examples you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run run github:apache:camel-k:examples/languages/routes.yaml
----

You can also use the `https` URL for GitHub. For example, you can browse the examples from a web-browser and
then copy the URL from the browser window and run the example with Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-k/blob/main/examples/languages/routes.yaml
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the groovy files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-k/tree/main/examples/languages/*.groovy
----

Or you can run all files starting with rou*

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-k/tree/main/examples/languages/rou*
----

=== Downloading routes hosted on GitHub

We have made it easy for Camel JBang to download existing examples from GitHub to local disk,
which allows for modifying the example and to run locally.

All you need to do is to copy the https link from the web browser.
For example, you can download the _dependency injection_ example by:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection
----

Then the files (not sub folders) are downloaded to the current directory.
The example can then be run locally with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also run in dev mode, to hot-deploy on source code changes.

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --dev
----

You can also download a single file, such as one of the Camel K examples:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-k/blob/main/examples/languages/simple.groovy
----

This is a groovy route, which you can run with (or use `*`):

[source,bash]
----
camel run simple.groovy
----

=== Running local Kamelets

You can also use Camel JBang to try local Kamelets, without the need to publish them on Github or package them in a jar.

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=/path/to/local/kamelets earthquake.yaml
----

=== Running Camel K integrations or bindings

Camel also supports running Camel K integrations and binding files, which are in CRD format (Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions).

For example a kamelet binding file named `joke.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
#!/usr/bin/env jbang camel@apache/camel run
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 2000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
    properties:
      show-headers: false
----

Can be run with camel:

[source,bash]
----
camel run joke.yaml
----

=== Using platform-http component

When a route is started from `platform-http` then CamelJBang will automatically include a VertX HTTP server
running on port 8080. For example the following route in a file named `server.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
#!/usr/bin/env jbang camel@apache/camel run
- from:
    uri: "platform-http:/hello"
    steps:
      - set-body:
          constant: "Hello World"
----

Can be run with

[source,bash]
----
camel run server.yaml
----

And you can call the HTTP service with:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello World%
----

=== Using Java beans and processors

There is basic support for including regular Java source files together with Camel routes,
and let Camel JBang runtime compile the Java source. This means you can include smaller utility
classes, POJOs, Camel Processors and whatnot that the application needs.

NOTE: The Java source files cannot use package names. This may change in the future.

=== Dependency Injection in Java classes

When running Camel applications with camel-jbang, then the runtime is `camel-main` based. This means
there is no Spring Boot, or Quarkus available. However, we have added support for using annotation
based dependency injection in Java classes.

==== Using Camel dependency injection

You can use the following Camel annotations (they work on all runtimes):

- `@BindToRegistry` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@BeanInject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field.
- `@PropertyInject` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@BindToRegistry` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.
- `@Converter` on class level to auto-register the xref:type-converter.adoc[type converters] from the class.

==== Using Spring Boot dependency injection

You can use the following Spring Boot annotations:

- `@Component` or `@Service` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@Autowired` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@Qualifier` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@Value` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@Bean` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.

==== Using Quarkus injection

You can use the following Quarkus annotations:

- `@ApplicationScoped` or `@Singleton` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]. `@Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@Inject` to dependency inject an bean on a class field. `@Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@ConfigProperty` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@Produces` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method. `@Named` can be used to specify the bean id.

=== Debugging

You can debug both Camel JBang and your integration scripts by making use of the `--debug` flag provided by JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel --debug run /path/to/integration.java
[jbang] Building jar...
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

As you can see the default listening port is 4004 but can be configured as described in https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/debugging.html[JBang Debugging].

== Packaging

The Camel JBang application can be packaged as a standalone _uber-jar_ without the need for JBang to run the application.

You simply do this by

[source,bash]
----
camel package uber-jar
----

Which will generate `camel-runner.jar` as the output file.
You can then run this JAR with Java that comes with everything included inside the .jar file.

You can run the JAR with Java as follows:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar camel-runner.jar
----

== Creating Projects

You can _export_ your Camel JBang application to a traditional Java based project such as Spring Boot or Quarkus.

=== Create Quarkus Project

NOTE: New implementation on the way

The create project command can be used to generate a maven project. After running the integration with the `run` command `create project` will generate a maven quarkus project with some required dependencies that can be used as a starting point for complex integrations. 

To execute this feature run:

[source,bash]
----
jbang camel@apache/camel create project integration.java integration.yaml integration.xml
----

this command generates a folder named CamelJBang that contains the quarkus project, in order to execute it the following command can be run:

[source,bash]
----
cd CamelJBang
mvn compile quarkus:dev
----

The table below lists all the command line options configurable on the `create project` command:

|===
|Option |Description

|name
|The name of the Camel application (artifactId and folder)

|group-id
|The group ID of the maven project

|directory
|Directory where the project will be created

|quarkus-dependency
|Comma separated list of camel-quarkus dependencies

|quarkus-bom-version
|Override quarkus bom version in pom.xml

|===

==== Examples

[source,bash]
----
jbang camel@apache/camel create project TimerRoute.java --quarkusDependencies=camel-quarkus-timer,camel-quarkus-log,camel-quarkus-yaml-dsl,camel-quarkus-http --name=TimerRouteProject
----

[source,bash]
----
jbang camel@apache/camel create project KafkaRoute.java --quarkusDependencies=camel-quarkus-kafka,camel-quarkus-log --name=KafkaRouteProject
----

== Troubleshooting

When using https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] then JBang stores state in `~/.jbang` directory.
This is also the location where JBang stores downloaded JARs.

Camel JBang also downloads needed dependencies while running. However, these dependencies
are downloaded to `~/.groovy` (downloaded via Groovy Grape).

So if you find problems with running Camel JBang using what is seems like an outdated JAR, then you can
try to delete these directories, or parts of it.
