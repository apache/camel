= Camel JBang

A JBang-based Camel app for easily running Camel routes.

== Installation

First you must install https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] which is used for launching Camel.
See instructions on https://www.jbang.dev/download/[JBang] how to download and install.

After JBang is installed you can verify JBang is working by executing the following command from a command shell:

[source,bash]
----
jbang version
----

Which should output the version of JBang.

To make it easier to use Camel JBang then install the following:

[source,bash]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

This will install Apache Camel as the `camel` command within JBang, meaning that you can run Camel from the command line
by just executing `camel` (see more next).

== Container Image

There is also a container image available in https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/camel-jbang/[Dockerhub]

[source,bash]
----
docker pull apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0
----

or

[source,bash]
----
podman pull apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0
----

Once you have the image in your local registry you can run all the command listed below by simple doing:

[source,bash]
----
docker run apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 version
----

or

[source,bash]
----
podman run apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 version
----

This will print the following result:

[source,bash]
----
Camel JBang version: 4.4.0
----

So running a simple route will be as easy as doing the following:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -v .:/integrations apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 run /integrations/example.yaml
----

or

[source,bash]
----
podman run -v .:/integrations apache/camel-jbang:4.4.0 run /integrations/example.yaml
----

== Using Camel JBang

The Camel JBang supports multiple commands. Running the command below, will print all of them:

[source,bash]
----
camel --help
----

TIP: The first time you run this command, it may cause dependencies to be cached, therefore taking a few extra seconds to run. If you are already using JBang and you get first time to run errors such as `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: "org/apache/camel/dsl/jbang/core/commands/CamelJBangMain"` you may try clearing the JBang cache and re-install again.

All the commands support the `--help` and will display the appropriate help if that flag is provided.

=== Enable shell completion

Camel JBang provides shell completion for bash and zsh out of the box. To enable shell completion for Camel JBang, run:

[source,bash]
----
source <(camel completion)
----

To make it permanent, run:

[source,bash]
----
echo 'source <(camel completion)' >> ~/.bashrc
----

== Creating and running Camel routes

You can create a new basic routes with the `init` command.

For example to create an XML route you do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init cheese.xml
----

Which creates the file `cheese.xml` (in the current directory) with a sample route.

To run the file, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run cheese.xml
----

NOTE: You can create and run any of the supported xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] in Camel such as YAML, XML, Java, Groovy.

To create a new .java route, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java
----

When using the init command then Camel will by default create the file in the current directory. However, you can use
the `--directory` option to create the file in the specified directory. For example to create in a folder
named _foobar_ you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java --directory=foobar
----

=== Running Routes from multiple files

You can run more than 1 file, for example to run two YAML files you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml two.yaml
----

You can also mix different xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] such as yaml and Java:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml hello.java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the yaml files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *.yaml
----

Or you can run all files starting with foo*

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo*
----

And to run everything

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

TIP: The run goal can also detect files that are `properties`, such as `application.properties`.

=== Running a Maven or Gradle based project

Camel JBang is intended for flat-file based projects, where you run small integrations.
However, Camel JBang may be used as a tool for migrating existing Maven or Gradle based projects.
To make the migration easier, then JBang can do _best effort_ to run, export, or transform these projects.

For example if you have a Maven based project, you can execute

[source,bash]
----
camel run pom.xml
----

or for a Gradle project

[source,bash]
----
camel run build.gradle
----

Camel JBang will then scan in `src/main/java` and `src/main/resources` for files to include (recursive).

NOTE: Using `camel run pom.xml` is not intended as a fully compatible way of running an existing Maven based project.

=== Running Route with user interactive prompt for placeholder values

You can create Camel integrations that makes it possible for the user to quickly enter placeholder values from command prompt.

For example given the following route:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class foo extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("timer:java?period={{time:1000}}")
            .setBody()
                .simple("Hello Camel from {{you}}")
            .log("${body}");
    }
}
----

Then if you run this with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
----

You will have an exception on startup about the missing value
[source,text]
----
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Property with key [you] not found in properties from text: Hello Camel from {{you}}`
----

However, you can then run in prompt mode as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --prompt
----

And Camel will now prompt in the terminal for you to enter values for the placeholders:

[source,bash]
----
2023-12-15 21:46:44.218  INFO 15033 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Apache Camel (JBang) 4.7.0 is starting
2023-12-15 21:46:44.331  INFO 15033 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Using Java 17.0.5 with PID 15033. Started by davsclaus in /Users/davsclaus/workspace/deleteme/prompt
2023-12-15 21:46:45.360  INFO 15033 --- [           main] mel.cli.connector.LocalCliConnector : Management from Camel JBang enabled

2023-12-15 21:46:55.239  INFO 15033 --- [           main] el.impl.engine.AbstractCamelContext : Apache Camel 4.7.0 (foo) is starting

----

From the snippet above, Camel JBang had two prompts. First for the `time` which has a default value of `1000` so you can just press ENTER to accept the default value.
And for `you` a value must be entered, and we entered `Jack` in this example.

You may want to use this for Camel prototypes where you want the user to be able to enter custom values quickly.
Those values can of course be pre-configured in `application.properties` as well.

=== Running Route from input parameter

For very small Java routes then it is possible to provide the route as CLI argument, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --code='from("kamelet:beer-source").to("log:beer")'
----

This is very limited as the CLI argument is a bit cumbersome to use than files.

- Java DSL code is only supported
- Code wrapped in single quote, so you can use double quote in Java DSL
- Code limited to what literal values possible to provide from the terminal and JBang.
- All route(s) must be defined in a single `--code` parameter.

NOTE: Using `--code` is only usable for very quick and small prototypes.

From *Camel 4.7* onwards the `--code` parameter can also refer to a `.java` source file,
that are not wrapped in a `public class` which makes it possible to quickly try a prototype
with some Camel java based routes such as the following stored in a file named `quick.java`:

[source,java]
----
from("timer:java?period=1000")
    .setBody()
        .simple("Hello Quick Camel from ${routeId}")
    .log("${body}");
----

Then you can run this route via:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --code=quick.java
----

NOTE: You cannot use `--dev` to hot-reload this on code changes.

=== Running Routes from source directory

You can also run dev mode when running Camel with `--source-dir`, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --source-dir=mycode
----

This starts Camel where it will load the files from the _source dir_ (also sub folders).

=== Stub components that should not be active

Sometimes you need to troubleshoot an existing integration and is given some Camel code (routes).
These routes may use different components, and those components may be tricky to run as they are configured
in a custom way, or need connection to servers you may not have access too.

You can run Camel JBang by stubbing those components (or all of them).

For example suppose you need access to a JMS broker in the given route below.

[source,java]
----
from("jms:inbox")
  .log("Incoming order")
  .to("bean:transform")
  .log("After transformation")
  .to("jms:process");
----

Then you can run this by stub the `jms` component by:

[source,bash]
----
camel run syncToDatabase.java --stub=jms
----

Then Camel will not start up the JMS component but replace it with the `stub` component, but keep the actual endpoint URIs.

You can then simulate sending messages to Camel with the `cmd send` command:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd send --body='Something here'
----

Which then will send the message to the incoming endpoint in the route, i.e. `jms:inbox` which has been stubbed.

You can also stub a specific endpoint by providing the full uri, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run syncToDatabase.java --stub=jms:inbox
----

Then only the `jms:inbox` endpoint is stubbed.

TIP: You can stub multiple components separated by comma, such as `--stub=jms,sql`

Camel JBang comes with the `camel cmd stub` command that allows to list all endpoints which
has been stubbed, and also browse any messages that are currently present in their internal queues.
A stub endpoint is based on the `seda` component.

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stub
----

And to browse the messages:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stub --browse
----

=== Dev mode with live reload

You can enable dev mode that comes with live reload of the route(s) when the source file is updated (saved),
using the `--dev` options as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.yaml --dev
----

Then while the Camel integration is running, you can update the YAML route and update when saving.

This works for all DLS even java, so you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --dev
----

NOTE: The live reload is meant for development purposes, and if you encounter problems with reloading
such as JVM class loading issues, then you may need to restart the integration.

You can also run dev mode when running Camel with `--source-dir`, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --source-dir=mycode --dev
----

This starts Camel where it will load the files from the _source dir_ (also sub folders).
And in _dev mode_ then you can add new files, update existing files, and delete files, and Camel
will automatically hot-reload on the fly.

Using _source dir_ is more flexible than having to specify the files in the CLI as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run mycode/foo.java mycode/bar.java --dev
----

In this situation then Camel will only watch and reload these two files (foo.java and bar.java).
So for example if you add a new file cheese.xml, then this file is not reloaded. On the other hand
if you use `--source-dir` then any files in this directory (and sub folders) are automatic detected
and reloaded. You can also delete files to remove routes.

NOTE: You cannot use both files and source dir together.
The following is not allowed: `camel run abc.java --source-dir=mycode`.

==== Uploading files to source directory via HTTP

When running Camel JBang with `--source-dir`, `--console` and `--dev` (reloading) then you can
change the source files on-the-fly by copying,modifying or deleting the files in the source directory.

This can also be done via HTTP using the `q/upload/:filename` HTTP endpoint using PUT and DELETE verbs.

Given you run Camel JBang with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --source-dir=mycode --console --dev
----

Then you can upload or modify a source file named `bar.java` you can send a PUT request via curl:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/bar.java --data-binary "@bar.java"
----

Or via:

[source,bash]
----
curl -T bar.java http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/bar.java
----

To send the data via PUT then the file body can be included when using `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:

For example from a CURL `--ascii-trace`:

[source,text]
----
0000: PUT /q/upload/bar.java HTTP/1.1
0021: Host: 0.0.0.0:8080
0035: User-Agent: curl/7.87.0
004e: Accept: */*
005b: Content-Length: 385
0070: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
00a1:
=> Send data, 385 bytes (0x181)
0000: // camel-k: language=java..import org.apache.camel.builder.Route
0040: Builder;..public class bar extends RouteBuilder {..    @Override
0080: .    public void configure() throws Exception {..        // Writ
00c0: e your routes here, for example:.        from("timer:java?period
0100: ={{time:1000}}").            .setBody().                .simple(
0140: "XXXCamel from ${routeId}").            .log("${body}");.    }.}
0180: .

0000: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

0000: content-length: 0
<= Recv header, 2 bytes (0x2)
0000:
== Info: Connection #0 to host 0.0.0.0 left intact
----

To delete one or more files you use the DELETE verb, such as:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/bar.java
----

You can also use wildcards ('*') to delete all .java files:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/*.java
----

Or to delete everything

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/upload/*
----

=== Developer Console

You can enable the developer console, which presents a variety of information to the developer.

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --console
----

The console is then accessible from a web browser at: http://localhost:8080/q/dev (by default).
The link is also shown in the log when Camel is starting up.

The console can give you insights into your running Camel integration, such as reporting the top
routes that takes the longest time to process messages. You can then drill down to pin-point, exactly
which individual EIPs in these routes are the slowest.

The developer console can also output the data in JSon format, which for example can be used by 3rd-party tooling
to scrape the information.

For example to output the top routes via curl, you can execute:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json"  http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/dev/top/
----

And if you have `jq` installed which can format and output the JSon data in colour, then do:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json"  http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/dev/top/ | jq
----

[#_using_profiles]
=== Using profiles

*Available from Camel 4.5*

Camel JBang comes with three set of profiles

- `dev` - for development (default)
- `test` - for testing (currently same as production)
- `prod` - for production

The developer profile will pre-configure Camel JBang with a number of developer assisted features when
running Camel. For example tracing messages during routing, additional metrics collected, and more.
This is useful during development and also enhanced the Camel JBang CLI tool.

However, you may want to run Camel JBang in a more production like situation, which you can do with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --profile=prod
----

You can have profile specific configuration in configuration files using the naming style `application-<profile>.properties`,
such as in the following:

- `application.properties` - Common configuration that is always in use (default).
- `application-dev.properties` - Developer specific configuration for  the `dev` profile.
- `application-prod.properties` - Developer specific configuration for  the `prod` profile.

The profile specific configuration will override values in the common configuration.

=== Downloading JARs over the internet

By default, Camel JBang will automatically resolve dependencies needed to run Camel, which is done
by JBang and Camel respectively. Camel itself detects at runtime if a component has a need for JARs that
are not currently available on the classpath, and can then automatic download the JARs (incl transitive).

Camel will download these JARs in the following order:

1. from local disk in `~/.m2/repository`
2. from internet in Maven Central
3. from internet in custom 3rd-party Maven repositories
4. from all the repositories found in active profiles of `~/.m2/settings.xml` or a settings file specified using
`--maven-settings` option.

If you do not want Camel JBang to download over the internet, you can turn this off with `--download`, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --download=false
----

If you do not want Camel JBang to use your existing Maven settings file, you can use:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=false
----

[#_adding_custom_jars]
=== Adding custom JARs

Camel JBang will automatically detect dependencies for Camel components, languages, data formats, etc. that
from its own release. This means you often do not have to specify which JARs to use.

However, if you need to add 3rd-party custom JARs then you can specify these with `--deps` as CLI argument in Maven
GAV syntax (`groupId:artifactId:version`), such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=com.foo:acme:1.0
----

In case you need to explicit add a Camel dependency you can use a shorthand syntax (starting with `camel:` or `camel-`)
such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=camel-saxon
----

You can specify multiple dependencies separated by comma:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=camel-saxon,com.foo:acme:1.0
----

=== Using 3rd-party Maven repositories

Camel JBang will download from local repository first, and then online from Maven Central.
To be able to download from 3rd-party Maven repositories then you need to specify this as CLI argument,
]or in `application.properties`

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --repos=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

TIP: Multiple repositories can be separated by comma

The configuration for the 3rd-party Maven repositories can also be configured in `application.properties`
with the key `camel.jbang.repositories` as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.jbang.repositories=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

And when running Camel then `application.properties` is automatically loaded:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
----

However, you can also explicit specify the properties file to use:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java application.properties
----

And even better if you specify this as a profile:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --profile=application
----

Where the profile id is the name of the properties file.


=== Configuration of Maven usage

By default, existing `~/.m2/settings.xml` file is loaded, so it is possible to alter the behaviour of Maven resolution
process. Maven settings file can provide information about Maven mirrors, credential configuration (potentially
encrypted) or active profiles and additional repositories.

Maven repositories can use authentication and the Maven-way to configure credentials is through `<server>` elements,
like this:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
    <id>external-repository</id>
    <username>camel</username>
    <password>{SSVqy/PexxQHvubrWhdguYuG7HnTvHlaNr6g3dJn7nk=}</password>
</server>
----

While the password may be specified using plain text, it's better to configure maven master password first and then
use it to configure repository password:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn -emp
Master password: camel
{hqXUuec2RowH8dA8vdqkF6jn4NU9ybOsDjuTmWvYj4U=}
----

The above password should be added to `~/.m2/settings-security.xml` file like this:

[source,xml]
----
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{hqXUuec2RowH8dA8vdqkF6jn4NU9ybOsDjuTmWvYj4U=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
----

Then a normal password can be configured like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn -ep
Password: camel
{SSVqy/PexxQHvubrWhdguYuG7HnTvHlaNr6g3dJn7nk=}
----

Finally, such password can be used in `<server>/<password>` configuration.

By default, Maven reads the master password from `~/.m2/settings-security.xml` file, but we can override it.
Location of the settings.xml file itself can be specified as well:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=/path/to/settings.xml --maven-settings-security=/path/to/settings-security.xml
----

If you want to run Camel application without assuming any location (even `~/.m2/settings.xml`), use this option:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=false
----


=== Running routes hosted on GitHub

You can run a route that is hosted on GitHub using Camels xref:components:others:resourceresolver-github.adoc[github] resource loader.

For example to run one of the Camel K examples you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run github:apache:camel-kamelets-examples:jbang/hello-java/Hey.java
----

You can also use the `https` URL for GitHub. For example, you can browse the examples from a web-browser and
then copy the URL from the browser window and run the example with Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/hello-java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the groovy files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/languages/*.groovy
----

Or you can run all files starting with rou*

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/languages/rou*
----

==== Running routes from GitHub gists

Using gists from GitHub is a quick way to share small Camel routes that you can easily run.

For example to run a gist you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

A gist can contain one or more files, and Camel JBang will gather all relevant files, so a gist
can contain multiple routes, properties files, Java beans, etc.

=== Downloading routes hosted on GitHub

We have made it easy for Camel JBang to download existing examples from GitHub to local disk,
which allows for modifying the example and to run locally.

All you need to do is to copy the https link from the web browser.
For example, you can download the _dependency injection_ example by:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection
----

Then the files (not sub folders) are downloaded to the current directory.
The example can then be run locally with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also download to a new folder using the `--directory` option, for example to download to a folder named _myproject_,
you would do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection --directory=myproject
----

You can also run in dev mode, to hot-deploy on source code changes.

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --dev
----

You can also download a single file, such as one of the Camel K examples:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-k-examples/blob/main/generic-examples/languages/simple.groovy
----

This is a groovy route, which you can run with (or use `*`):

[source,bash]
----
camel run simple.groovy
----

==== Downloading routes form GitHub gists

You can also download files from gists easily as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

This will then download the files to local disk, which you can run afterwards:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also download to a new folder using the `--directory` option, for example to download to a folder named _foobar_,
you would do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92 --directory=foobar
----

=== Using a specific Camel version

You can specify which Camel version to run as shown:

[source,bash]
----
jbang -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.18.4 camel@apache/camel [command]
----

NOTE: Older versions of Camel may not work as well with Camel JBang as the newest versions.
Starting from Camel 3.20 onwards is the versions that are recommended to be used onwards.

TIP: In Camel *3.20.3* onwards there is a `version` command, see the following section for more details.

In *Camel 3.20.2* onwards the `run` command has built-in support, using `--camel-version`,
for specifying Camel version to use for the running Camel integration.

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --camel-version=3.18.4
----

TIP: This makes it easy to try different Camel versions, for example when you need to reproduce an issue,
and find out how it works in different Camel version.

You can also try bleeding edge development by using SNAPSHOT such as:

=== Using the version command

In *Camel 3.20.3* onwards the `version` command makes it possible to configure a specific version
of Camel to use when running or exporting. This makes it possible to use the latest Camel JBang CLI
and run integrations using an older Camel version.

[source,bash]
----
camel version
Camel JBang version: 3.20.3
----

Here Camel JBang is using version 3.20.3. Now suppose we want to run Camel integrations with version 3.18.2.

[source,bash]
----
camel version set 3.18.2
----

And you can see what Camel version has been set by:

[source,bash]
----
camel version
Camel JBang version: 3.20.3
User configuration:
    camel-version = 3.18.2
----

And when running an integration, then Camel JBang will show you the _version override_ when starting.

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
Running integration with the following configuration:
    --camel-version=3.18.2
2023-03-17 13:35:13.876  INFO 28451 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport        : Apache Camel (JBang) 3.18.2 is starting
...
----

IMPORTANT: You cannot use both a set version via `camel version set` and also a version specified via `--camel-version` option,
i.e the following is not possible:

[source,bash]
----
camel version set 4.0.1
camel run * --camel-version=4.3.0
----

If you want to unset the version, you can use the `--reset` option:

[source,bash]
----
camel version set --reset
----

Then the Camel version in use will be the same version as Camel JBang.

==== Listing available Camel releases

The `version` command can also show available Camel releases by checking the Maven central repository.

[source,bash]

NOTE: The `version list` shows the latest releases going back a few versions, at this time of writing the minimum version
is Camel 3.14. To show all Camel 3.x releases, you can specify `--from-version=3.0` and the list is longer.
The list can only go back to Camel 2.18, as we do not have all release meta-data for older releases.

You can also show Camel releases for either Spring Boot or Quarkus using the `--runtime` option, such as:

TIP: See more options with `camel version list --help`.

=== Manage plugins

Camel JBang uses a plugin concept for some of the subcommands so users can add functionality on demand.
Each provided plugin adds a list of commands to the Camel JBang command line tool.

You can list the supported plugins with

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin get --all
----

[source,text]
----
Supported plugins:

 NAME        COMMAND     DEPENDENCY                                      DESCRIPTION
 kubernetes  kubernetes  org.apache.camel:camel-jbang-plugin-kubernetes  Run Camel applications on Kubernetes
 camel-k     k           org.apache.camel:camel-jbang-plugin-k           Managed Camel integrations on Kubernetes
 generate    generate    org.apache.camel:camel-jbang-plugin-generate    Generate code such as DTOs
----

In case you want to enable a plugin and its functionality you can add it as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin add <plugin-name>
----

For example to install `generate` you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin add generate
----

This adds the plugin and all subcommands are now available for execution.

You can list the currently installed plugins with:

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin get
----

To remove a plugin from the current Camel JBang command line tooling you can use the `plugin delete` command.

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin delete <plugin-name>
----

=== Running Camel K integrations or pipes

Camel also supports running Camel K integrations and pipes, which represent Kubernetes custom resources following a specific CRD format (Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions).

For example a pipe file named `joke.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
#!/usr/bin/env jbang camel@apache/camel run
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Pipe
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 2000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
    properties:
      show-headers: false
----

Can be run with camel:

[source,bash]
----
camel run joke.yaml
----

==== Binding Kamelets in a pipe

Camel JBang is able to create the Pipe custom resource for you.
You can use the `bind` command to specify a source and a sink that should be set in the pipe.
As a result Camel JBang will create a proper Pipe custom resource for you.

The command expects a file name as command argument and provides several options to define the source and the sink that should be used in the pipe.

[source,bash]
----
camel bind joke.yaml --source chuck-norris-source --sink log-sink
----

This creates the `joke.yaml` file that represents the Pipe resource.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Pipe
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 5000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
----

NOTE: The bind command is able to inspect the Kamelets being used as a source and sink in order to automatically set all required properties.
In case the Kamelet defines a required property and the user has not specified such the command will automatically set this property with an example value.
Once the pipe resource file is generated you can review and set the properties as you wish.

The bind command supports the following options:

[width="100%",cols="1m,3",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|--source
|Source (from) such as a Kamelet or Camel endpoint uri that provides data..

|--sink
|Sink (to) such as a Kamelet or Camel endpoint uri where data should be sent to.

|--step
|Add optional 1-n steps to the pipe processing. Each step represents a reference to a Kamelet of type action.

|--property
|Add a pipe property in the form of [source,sink,error-handler,step-<n>].<key>=<value> where <n> is the step number starting from 1.

|--error-handler
|Add error handler (none,log,sink:<endpoint>). Sink endpoints are expected in the format [[apigroup/]version:]kind:[namespace/]name, plain Camel URIs or Kamelet name.

|--output
|Output format generated by this command (supports: file, yaml or json). Default is "file".
|=======================================================================

==== Binding explicit Camel URIs

Usually, the source and sink reference a Kamelet by its name as shown in the previous section.
As an alternative, you can also just use an arbitrary Camel endpoint URI that acts as a source or sink in the pipe.

[source,bash]
----
camel bind joke.yaml --source chuck-norris-source --sink https://mycompany.com/the-service
----

As a result the Pipe resource uses the Camel endpoints as source and sink.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Pipe
metadata:
  name: my-pipe
spec:
  source:
# ...
  sink:
    uri: https://mycompany.com/the-service # <1>
----
<1> Pipe with explicit Camel endpoint URI as sink where the data gets pushed to

==== Advanced binding options

The Camel K JBang plugin also provides the bind command. It enhances the arbitrary bind command with the option to directly create this resource on the
Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to the plugin documentation for more complex examples and a full description on how to use the bind command options.

=== Creating a new Kamelet

You can create a new kamelet with the `init` command by using kamelet naming convention.

For example to create a new kamelet source, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init cheese-source.kamelet.yaml
----

This will create a basic kamelet (based on the timer source).

And to use the kamelet you could create the following route:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "kamelet:cheese-source"
    parameters:
      period: "2000"
      message: "Hello World"
    steps:
      - log: "${body}"
----

If you want to create a sink kamelet, then you just name it with sink as follows (based on log sink):

[source,bash]
----
camel init wine-sink.kamelet.yaml
----

You can then change the route to use the wine kamelet as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "kamelet:cheese-source"
    parameters:
      period: "2000"
      message: "Hello World"
    steps:
      - to: "kamelet:wine-sink"
----

If you want to create a new Kamelet based on an existing Kamelet, for example to create a new sink based on the existing MySQL:

[source,bash]
----
camel init orderdb-sink.kamelet.yaml --from-kamelet=mysql-sink
----

=== Run from clipboard

You can also run Camel routes directly from the OS clipboard. This allows to copy some code,
and then quickly run this.

The syntax is

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.<extension>
----

Where `<extension>` is what kind of file the content of the clipboard is, such as `java`, `xml`, or `yaml` etc.

For example. you can copy this to your clipboard and then run it afterwards:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="timer:foo"/>
  <log message="Hello World"/>
</route>
----

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.xml
----

==== Run and reload from clipboard

*Available since Camel 4.2*

It is also possible to run from clipboard in _reload_ mode as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.xml --dev
----

Then you can quickly make changes and copy to clipboard, and Camel JBang will update while running.

=== Sending messages via Camel

*Available since Camel 4*

When building integrations with Camel JBang, you may find yourself in need of being able
to send messages into Camel, to test your Camel routes. This can be challenging when the
Camel routes are connecting to external systems using different protocols.

The best approach is to send messages into these external systems using standard tools provided,
by these systems, which often can be done using CLI tools. However, in some situations, where you
may not be familiar with these tools, you can try to let Camel send the message. Note that this
can only be possible in some scenarious, and should only be used as _quick way_.

Suppose you have a Camel route that consumes messages from an external MQTT broker:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    from:
      uri: kamelet:mqtt5-source
      parameters:
        topic: temperature
        brokerUrl: tcp://mybroker:1883
      steps:
        - transform:
            expression:
              jq:
                expression: .value
        - log:
            message: The temperature is ${body}
----

In the example above the MQTT broker is running on hostname `mybroker` port 1883.

The idea with the `camel cmd send` command is to _tap into_ an existing running Camel integration,
and reuse an existing endpoint (if possible). In this example we want to use the existing configuration
to avoid having to configure this again.

By executing the following from a shell

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd send --body=file:payload.json mqtt
----

We can send a message, where the payload is loaded from a file (payload.json). You can also specify the payload in the CLI
argument, but it's cumbersome to specify JSon structure so often its better to refer to a local file.

[source,json]
----
{
  "value": 21
}
----

The `mqtt` argument is the name of the existing running Camel integration. You can also specify the PID instead.
So what happens is that Camel will let the existing integration send the message.

Because the existing integration only have 1 route, then the `send` command will automatic pick
the _from_ endpoint, i.e. `kamelet:mqtt5-source` with all its configuration. If there are multiple routes,
then you can filter which route/endpoint by the `--endpoint` option:

For example to pick the first route by _route id_:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd send --body=file:payload.json --endpoint=route1 mqtt
----

Or to pick the first route that uses mqtt component:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel cmd send --body=file:payload.json --endpoint=mqtt mqtt
----

We are fortunate in this situation as the endpoint can be used as both a _consumer_ and _producer_ in Camel,
and therefore we are able to send the message to the MQTT broker via `tcp://mybroker:1883` on topic _temperate_.

TIP: See more options with `camel cmd send --help`.

The source for this example is provided on GitHub at https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/mqtt)[camel-jbang MQTT example].

=== Controlling local Camel integrations

To list the currently running Camel integrations you use the `ps` command:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps
  PID   NAME                             READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica...   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude                             1/1   Running   4m34s
----

This lists the PID, the name and age of the integration.

You can use the `stop` command to stop any of these running Camel integrations.
For example to stop dude, you can do

[source,bash]
----
camel stop dude
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

You can also stop by the PID:

[source,bash]
----
camel stop 62506
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

TIP: You do not have to type the full name, as the stop command will match using integrations
that starts with the input, for example you can do `camel stop d` to stop all integrations
starting with d.

To stop all integrations, then execute without any pid:

[source,bash]
----
camel stop
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 61818)
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

==== Watching local Camel integrations

Most of the management commands can run in _watch_ mode, which repetitively output the status in full-screen mode.
This is done using the `--watch` parameter as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps --watch
  PID   NAME                             READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica...   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude                             1/1   Running   4m34s
----

==== Controlling Spring Boot and Quarkus integrations

The Camel JBang CLI will by default only control Camel integrations that are running using the CLI, eg `camel run foo.java`.

For the CLI to be able to control and manage Spring Boot or Quarkus applications, then you need to add a dependency
to these projects to integrate with Camel CLI.

In Spring Boot you add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-cli-connector-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In Quarkus you need to add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-cli-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

==== Getting status of Camel integrations

The `get` command in Camel JBang is used for getting Camel specific status for one
or all of the running Camel integrations.

To display the status of the running Camel integrations:

[source,bash]
----
camel get
  PID   NAME      CAMEL   PLATFORM            READY  STATUS    AGE    TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  SINCE-LAST
 61818  MyCamel   3.20.0  Spring Boot v2.7.3   1/1   Running  28m34s    854       0         0     0s/0s/-
 63051  dude      3.20.0  JBang                1/1   Running     18s     14       0         0     0s/0s/-
 63068  mygroovy  3.20.0  JBang                1/1   Running      5s      2       0         0     0s/0s/-
----

The `camel get` command will default display Camel application (context), which is equivalent to
typing `camel get context`.

This displays overall information for every Camel integration, where you can see
the total number of messages processed. The column _Since Last_
shows how long time ago the last processed message for 3 stages (started/completed/failed).

The value of `0s/0s/-` means that the last started and completed message just happened (0 seconds ago),
and  that there has not been any failed message yet. And this example `9s/9s/1h3m` means that last started and
completed message is 9 seconds ago, and last failed is 1 hour and 3 minutes ago.

TIP: You can run in _watch_ mode using: `camel get --watch`

From *Camel 4.7* onwards two numbers will be displayed for _TOTAL_, _FAILED_, and _INFLIGHT_ columns.
The first number is messages received from external systems (databases, cloud systems), and then second
number is the total number (as in earlier versions).

[source,bash]
----
camel get
  PID   NAME    CAMEL  PLATFORM        PROFILE  READY  STATUS   RELOAD  AGE   ROUTE  MSG/S  TOTAL  FAIL  INFLIGHT  LAST  DELTA  SINCE-LAST
 42240  cheese  4.7.0  JBang v0.116.0  dev       1/1   Running       0  1m8s    2/2   1.01   1/65   0/0       0/0     0     -1     1s/1s/-
----

The _TOTAL_ column above shows `1/65` which mean that 1 message was from external source, and 65 in total; which means that
64 are from internal sources (such as timer, seda).

You can also see the status of every routes, from all the local Camel integrations with `camel get route`:

[source,bash]
----
camel get route
  PID   NAME      ID      FROM                        STATUS    AGE   TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST
 61818  MyCamel   hello   timer://hello?period=2000   Running  29m2s    870       0         0     0    0   14     0s/0s/-
 63051  dude      java    timer://java?period=1000    Running    46s     46       0         0     0    0    9     0s/0s/-
 63068  mygroovy  groovy  timer://groovy?period=1000  Running    34s     34       0         0     0    0    5     0s/0s/-
----

TIP: Use `camel get --help` to display all the available commands as additional will be added in upcoming releases.

==== Top status of Camel integrations

The `camel top` command is intended for getting top utilization statistics (highest to lowest heap used memory)
of the running Camel integrations.

[source,bash]
----
camel top

The _HEAP_ column shows the heap memory (used/committed/max) and the non-heap (used/committed).
The _GC_ column shows garbage collection information (time and total runs).
The _CLASSES_ column shows number of classes (loaded/total).

You can also see the top performing routes (highest to lowest mean processing time)
of every routes, from all the local Camel integrations with `camel top route`:

[source,bash]
----

----

TIP: Use `camel top --help` to display all the available commands as additional will be added in upcoming releases.

==== Tailing logs

When you run Camel integrations then they will by default run in the foreground and output logs.

You can from another terminal access the logs from any Camel integration with the `log` command, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.288  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Apache Camel (JBang) 3.21.0 is starting
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.395  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Using Java 17.0.5 with PID 44619. Started by davsclaus in /Users/davsclaus/workspace/
...
----

You can also watch logs for all Camel integrations by `camel log`, or you can specify by name/pids (separate by comma) `camel log bar,chuck`.

It is also possible to find and highlight keywords from the log using `--find`, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --find=invoice
----

You can find multiple items by repeating the option, i.e.:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --find=invoice --find=order
----

There is also a _grep_ option that will filter the logs to only show lines that matches text (ignore case).

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --grep=error
----

The log command will by default tail the logs for new lines. If you want to exit the command immediately, you
can turn off following as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel log chuck --grep=error --follow=false
----

This will grep the logs for log lines with matches text `error` and output only these logs, and exit.

==== Tracing messages

The `trace` command is used for showing how messages are routed in Camel. The command has similar output as the `log`
command but only display message tracing information. This allows you to see every _step_ a message is routed in Camel.

The `trace` command has many options and can be used to _filter_, _grep_ or output on different detail _levels`.
The _exchange id_ is logged (and grouped by colour), so you can use that to correlate the events, when traces are interleaved.

For example if an existing integration is running named chuck, you can trace it as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel trace chuck
----

You can also trace all running integrations

[source,bash]
----
camel trace
----

==== Running Camel integrations in background

The `run` command allows to run Camel in the background with the `--background` option.
Therefore, to see and understand what happens then the management commands
cane be used, such as `camel ps`, `camel get`, and `camel log`.

[source,bash]
----
$ camel run chuck.yaml --background
Running Camel integration: chuck in background with PID: 80093

$ camel ps
  PID   NAME    READY  STATUS   AGE
 80093  chuck    1/1   Running  33s
----

To see the log use `camel log`
[source,bash]
----
$ camel log
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.288  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Apache Camel (JBang) 3.21.0 is starting
chuck     | 2023-01-04 17:59:19.395  INFO 44619 --- [           main] org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport   : Using Java 17.0.5 with PID 44619. Started by davsclaus in /Users/davsclaus/workspace/
...
----

To stop the integration you can use `camel stop`

[source,bash]
----
$ camel stop chuck
Shutting down Camel integration (pid: 80093)
----

==== Starting and Stopping routes

The `camel cmd` is intended for executing miscellaneous commands in the running Camel integrations.
For example there are commands to start and stop routes.

To stop all the routes in the chuck integration, you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stop-route chuck
----

And the status will then report the status as _Stopped_ for the chuck integration:

[source,bash]
----
camel get route
  PID   NAME     ID                     FROM                                 STATUS    AGE   TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST
 81663  chuck    chuck                  kamelet://chuck-norris-source        Stopped           600       0         0     0    0    1          4s
 81663  chuck    chuck-norris-source-1  timer://chuck?period=10000           Stopped           600       0         0    65   52  290          4s
 81663  chuck    log-sink-2             kamelet://source?routeId=log-sink-2  Stopped           600       0         0     0    0    1          4s
 83415  bar      route1                 timer://yaml2?period=1000            Started  5m30s    329       0         0     0    0   10          0s
 83695  MyCamel  hello                  timer://hello?period=2000            Started  3m52s    116       0         0     0    0    9          1s
----

To start the routes, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route chuck
----

To stop _all_ routes in every Camel integration:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stop-route
----

And you can start _all_ routes using:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route
----

To start a specific route, you need to use `--id` parameter such as the following,
which will start routes named `route1` in all running integrations:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route --id=route1
----

If you want to do this in a specific integration you must include the name or pid:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route bar --id=route1
----

TIP: You can stop one or more route by their ids by separating using
comma such as: camel cmd start-route --id=route1,hello. Use `camel cmd start-route --help` for more details.

==== Running Camel integrations on Kubernetes

After developing the Camel routes locally with JBang you may want to run these also on the Kubernetes platform at some point.

Camel JBang provides a plugin for managing and easily running Camel applications on Kubernetes.
The plugin uses the project export functionality to build and deploy the application on Kubernetes with Quarkus or SpringBoot.

Read about it in xref:camel-jbang-kubernetes.adoc[Camel Kubernetes plugin].

In addition to that you can also leverage the Camel K plugin commands that interact with the Camel K operator on Kubernetes.
Camel K gets you started with the journey of running Camel integrations on Kubernetes in a declarative way.
The container image build, push to registry as well as the ownership of deployments is all taken care of by the Camel K operator.

Read about it in xref:camel-jbang-k.adoc[Camel K plugin].

==== Configuring logging levels

You can see the current logging levels of the running Camel integrations by:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd logger
  PID   NAME   AGE   LOGGER  LEVEL
 90857  bar   2m48s  root    INFO
 91103  foo     20s  root    INFO
----

The logging level can be changed at runtime, for example to change foo to DEBUG you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd logger --level=DEBUG foo
----

TIP: You can use `--all` to change logging levels for all running integrations.

===== Configuring individual logging levels

From *Camel 4.6* onwards you can easily configure different logging levels from CLI and `application.properties`.

For example from CLI you can specify using the `--logging-category` option. For example to enable DEBUG logging if using Kafka:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel run myapp.yaml --logging-category=org.apache.kafka=DEBUG
----

You can specify multiple categories by repeating the CLI option as shown:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel run myapp.yaml --logging-category=org.apache.kafka=DEBUG --logging-category=com.foo.something=TRACE
----

You can also configure logging levels in `application.properties` using two styles

- `logging.level.` is the default style used by Camel and Spring Boot
- `quarkus.log.category.` is used by Quarkus

For example, you can declare as follows:

[source,properties]
----

# make it easy to configure individual logging levels
logging.level.org.apache.kafka = DEBUG
logging.level.com.foo.something = TRACE

# you can also use quarkus style naming
quarkus.log.category."org.apache.kafka".level = DEBUG
quarkus.log.category."com.foo.something".level = TRACE
----

==== Listing services

Some Camel integrations may host a service which clients can call, such as REST, or SOAP-WS, or socket-level services using TCP protocols.

You can list the available services as shown in the example below:

[source,bash]
----
camel get service
 PID   NAME       COMPONENT      PROTOCOL  SERVICE
 1912  netty      netty          tcp       tcp:localhost:4444
 2023  greetings  platform-http  rest      http://0.0.0.0:7777/camel/greetings/{name} (GET)
 2023  greetings  platform-http  http      http://0.0.0.0:7777/q/dev
----

Here you can see 2 Camel integrations. The netty integration hosts a TCP service that is available on port 4444.
The other Camel integration hosts a REST service that can be called via GET only.
And finally the integration comes with embedded web console (started with the `--console` option).

NOTE: For a service to be listed then Camel components must be able to advertise the services using xref:camel-console.adoc[].

==== Observability with metrics

Camel JBang comes with support for using Micrometer for metrics that easily can be made available.

You simply either run with `--metrics` option, or enable and have more control of the configuration in the `application.properties` file as shown below:

[source,properties]
----
# enable HTTP server with metrics
camel.server.enabled=true
camel.server.metricsEnabled=true

# turn on micrometer metrics
camel.metrics.enabled=true
# include more camel details
camel.metrics.enableMessageHistory=true
# include additional out-of-the-box micrometer metrics for cpu, jvm and used file descriptors
camel.metrics.binders=processor,jvm-info,file-descriptor
----

Then you can access metrics from the web browser at: http://localhost:8080/q/metrics

You can also see metrics from the CLI as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel get metric
  PID   NAME         TYPE   METRIC                         ROUTE                  VALUE  MEAN  MAX  TOTAL
 11562  MyCoolCamel  timer  camel.exchange.event.notifier                             3    12   27     35
 11562  MyCoolCamel  timer  camel.exchange.event.notifier                             3     1    2      3
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  camel.routes.added                                        3
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  camel.routes.running                                      3
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  jvm.info                                                  1
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  process.cpu.usage                     0.0045185067010171795
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  process.files.max                                     10240
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  process.files.open                                      288
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  system.cpu.count                                          8
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  system.cpu.usage                        0.15222772277227722
 11562  MyCoolCamel  gauge  system.load.average.1m                        3.58935546875
----

==== Listing state of Circuit Breakers

If your Camel integration uses xref:components:eips:circuitBreaker-eip.adoc[Circuit Breaker] then
you can output the status of the breakers with Camel JBang as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel get circuit-breaker
  PID   NAME  COMPONENT     ROUTE   ID               STATE      PENDING  SUCCESS  FAIL  REJECT
 56033  mycb  resilience4j  route1  circuitBreaker1  HALF_OPEN        5        2     3       0
----

Here we can see the circuit breaker is in _half open_ state, i.e. a state where the breaker is attempting
to transition back to closed, if the failures start to drop.

TIP: You can run the command with watch to keep showing the latest state `watch camel get circuit-breaker`.

=== Using Jolokia and Hawtio

The https://hawt.io/[Hawtio] web console allows inspecting running Camel integrations, such
as all the JMX management information, and not but least to visualize the Camel routes
with live performance metrics. Hawtio is a handy tool for many years, and we have made it
easy to use Hawtio with Camel JBang.

To let Hawtio able to inspect the Camel integrations, then the Jolokia JVM Agent
must be installed in the running integration, this can be done, either explicit as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps
  PID   NAME                             READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica...   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude.java                        1/1   Running   4m34s
----

With the PID you can then attach Jolokia:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia 62506
Started Jolokia for PID 62506
http://127.0.0.1:8778/jolokia/
----

Instead of using PID you can also attach by name pattern. In this example because the
two Camel integrations have unique names (foo and dude), then you can also attach Jolokia
without knowing the PID as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia du
Started Jolokia for PID 62506
http://127.0.0.1:8778/jolokia/
----

Then you can launch https://hawt.io/[Hawtio] using Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel hawtio
----

This will automatically download and start Hawtio, and open in web browser.

TIP: See `camel hawtio --help` for options.

And when Hawtio launches in the web browser, click the _Discover_ tab which should
list all the local available Jolokia Agents (yes you can use `camel jolokia PID` to connect
to multiple different Camel integrations and from this list select which to load).

Click the green _lightning_ icon to connect to running Camel integration (of choice).

You can uninstall the Jolokia JVM Agent in a running Camel integration when no longer needed:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia 62506 --stop
Stopped Jolokia for PID 62506
----

It is also possible to do this with only one command, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel hawtio dude
----

Where _dude_ is the name of the running Camel integration. When you stop Hawtio (using `ctrl` + `c`)
then Camel will attempt to uninstall the Jolokia JVM Agent, however this may not be
able to do this always, because the JVM is being terminated which can prevent camel-jbang
from doing JVM process communication to the running Camel integration.

=== Scripting from terminal using pipes

You can also execute a Camel JBang file as a script that can be used for terminal scripting with pipes and filters.

NOTE: Every time the script is executed a JVM is started with Camel. This is not very fast or low on memory usage,
so use Camel JBang terminal scripting where using Camel makes sense. For example to use the
many Camel components or Kamelets to more easily send or receive data from disparate IT systems.

This requires to add the following line in top of the file, for example as in the `upper.yaml` file below:

[source,text]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang --quiet camel@apache/camel pipe "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

# Will upper-case the input
- from:
    uri: "stream:in"
    steps:
      - setBody:
          simple: "${body.toUpperCase()}"
      - to: "stream:out"
----

To be able to execute this as a script, you need to set execute file permission:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x upper.yaml
----

Then you can then execute this as a script:

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./upper.yaml
----

Which should output:

[source,text]
----
HELLO
WORLD
----

Logging can be turned on using `--logging=true` which then logs to `.camel-jbang/camel-pipe.log` file.
The name of the logging file cannot be configured.

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./upper.yaml --logging=true
----

==== Using stream:in with line vs raw mode

When using `stream:in` to read data from _System in_ then the xref:components::stream-component.adoc[Stream component]
works in two modes:

- line mode (default) - reads input as single lines (separated by line breaks).
  Message body is a `String`.
- raw mode - reads the entire stream until _end of stream_.
  Message body is a `byte[]`.

IMPORTANT: The default mode is due to historically how the stream component was created.
Therefore, you may want to set `stream:in?readLine=false` to use raw mode.

=== Running local Kamelets

You can also use Camel JBang to try local Kamelets, without the need to publish them on GitHub or package them in a jar.

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=/path/to/local/kamelets earthquake.yaml
----

TIP: When the kamelets are from local file system, then they can be live reloaded, if they are updated, when you run
Camel JBang in `--dev` mode.

You can also point to a folder in a GitHub repository. For example, we have provided some custom Kamelets
at https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets which can be used easily:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets user.java
----

NOTE: If a kamelet is loaded from GitHub, then they cannot be live reloaded.

=== Using platform-http component

When a route is started from `platform-http` then Camel JBang will automatically include a VertX HTTP server
running on port 8080. For example the following route in a file named `server.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "platform-http:/hello"
    steps:
      - set-body:
          constant: "Hello World"
----

Can be run with

[source,bash]
----
camel run server.yaml
----

And you can call the HTTP service with:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello World%
----

=== Using Java beans and processors

There is basic support for including regular Java source files together with Camel routes,
and let Camel JBang runtime compile the Java source. This means you can include smaller utility
classes, POJOs, Camel Processors and whatnot that the application needs.

IMPORTANT: The Java source files cannot use package names. This may change in the future.

=== Dependency Injection in Java classes

When running Camel integrations with camel-jbang, then the runtime is `camel-main` based. This means
there is no Spring Boot, or Quarkus available. However, we have added support for using annotation
based dependency injection in Java classes.

==== Using Camel dependency injection

You can use the following Camel annotations on Camel standalone:

- `@org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry` on class level (for custom beans, processors, etc.) to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@org.apache.camel.Configuration` on class level for `CamelConfiguation` classes, which is used during Camel startup (only Camel Main runtime) to allow custom setup that requires some coding.

And these annotations should work on all runtimes
(if target runtime is either Quarkus or Spring Boot then favour using their annotations):

- `@org.apache.camel.BeanInject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field.
- `@org.apache.camel.PropertyInject` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.
- `@org.apache.camel.Converter` on class level to auto-register the xref:type-converter.adoc[type converters] from the class.

IMPORTANT: You can use `@BeanInject` annotation to refer to existing bean annotated with `@BindToRegistry`, however this is possible if the dependency is registered before the dependant.

==== Using Spring Boot dependency injection

You can use the following Spring Boot annotations:

- `@org.springframework.stereotype.Component` or `@org.springframework.stereotype.Service` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.

==== Using Quarkus injection

You can use the following Quarkus annotations:

- `@javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` or `@javax.inject.Singleton` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@javax.inject.Inject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.

==== Using beans in Camel XML DSL

Since Camel *4.0.0*, when using xref:components:others:java-xml-io-dsl.adoc[XML DSL] we can declare additional beans in similar way as in xref:components:others:yaml-dsl.adoc[YAML DSL]. Such beans will be added to xref:registry.adoc[Registry] and can be referred to for example from routes.

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

	<bean name="beanFromMap" type="com.acme.MyBean">
		<properties>
			<property key="foo" value="bar" />
		</properties>
	</bean>

</camel>
----

The properties of the bean can be defined using either nested `<property>` and `<properties>` elements or using dotted properties style, as shown in the example below:

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <!-- nested properties style -->
	<bean name="beanFromMap" type="com.acme.MyBean">
		<properties>
			<property key="field1" value="f1_p" />
			<property key="field2" value="f2_p" />
			<property key="nested">
				<properties>
					<property key="field1" value="nf1_p" />
					<property key="field2" value="nf2_p" />
				</properties>
			</property>
		</properties>
	</bean>

    <!-- dotted properties style -->
	<bean name="beanFromProps" type="com.acme.MyBean">
		<properties>
			<property key="field1" value="f1_p" />
			<property key="field2" value="f2_p" />
			<property key="nested.field1" value="nf1_p" />
			<property key="nested.field2" value="nf2_p" />
		</properties>
	</bean>

</camel>
----

==== Using Spring beans in Camel XML DSL

Since Camel *4.0.0*, when using xref:components:others:java-xml-io-dsl.adoc[XML DSL], we can also declare _beans_ using Spring Beans XML namespace. All these beans will be added to xref:registry.adoc[Registry].

This will not make the application managed by Spring Framework / Spring Boot. Simply Camel will leverage existing support for generic bean definition including:

* dependency injection
* constructor injection
* dependency cycles
* wiring existing Camel objects (like `org.apache.camel.CamelContext`)

xref:components:others:java-xml-io-dsl.adoc[XML DSL] allows to use XML documents that define routes, rests and route templates. Since Camel *4.0.0* these documents may use new root XML element (either `<camel>` or `<beans>` to resemble Spring XML DSL), where other Camel elements (like `<routes>`) are contained.

Here's an example `camel.xml` file, which defines both the routes and beans used (referred to) by the route definition:

.camel.xml
[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
        <bean id="messageString" class="java.lang.String">
            <constructor-arg index="0" value="Hello"/>
        </bean>

        <bean id="greeter" class="org.apache.camel.main.app.Greeter">
            <description>Spring Bean</description>
            <property name="message">
                <bean class="org.apache.camel.main.app.GreeterMessage">
                    <property name="msg" ref="messageString"/>
                </bean>
            </property>
        </bean>
    </beans>

    <route id="my-route">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <bean ref="greeter"/>
        <to uri="mock:finish"/>
    </route>

</camel>
----

This document contains embedded `<beans>` element using Spring Beans XML namespace (`http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans`) - Camel passes this element directly to Spring `org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanDefinitionReader` and all read beans are used to populate xref:registry.adoc[Camel Registry].

The beans declared this way may use references to some predefined Camel beans. Currently these are handled:

* "CamelContext" - an instance of current `org.apache.camel.CamelContext`
* "MainConfiguration" - an instance of `org.apache.camel.main.MainConfigurationProperties` used for `org.apache.camel.main.KameletMain`

So we can use this XML fragment without actually defining what `CamelContext` is.

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
        <bean id="greeter" class="org.apache.camel.main.app.Greeter">
            <property name="camelContext" ref="CamelContext"/>
            <!-- ... -->
        </bean>
    </beans>

    <route id="my-route">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <bean ref="greeter"/>
        <to uri="mock:finish"/>
    </route>

</camel>
----

What's more, we can declare some additional beans that can affect internal mechanics of `CamelContext` being run. `org.apache.camel.main.DefaultConfigurationConfigurer` is used by xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main] to configure `CamelContext` using beans found in xref:registry.adoc[Camel Registry].

For example we can customize used `org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator` with this XML fragment to replace UUID generator used by Camel (which defaults to `org.apache.camel.support.DefaultUuidGenerator`):

[source,xml]
----
<camel>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans">
        <bean id="customUUIDGenerator" class="org.apache.camel.support.ShortUuidGenerator" />
    </beans>

</camel>
----

That's it - Camel context will then look up for the instances of `org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator` and if one is found, it'll be used by Camel.

=== Configuring JDBC DataSources

When using SQL databases, then you would often need to configure a JDBC connection pool. You can do this:

- Manually by adding 3rd party JAR dependency for the data source (and connection pool), and configure this from Java or XML/YAML DSL.
- *Camel 4.6* Spring Boot style with `spring.datasource.` configuration in `application.properties` (uses Hikari connection-pool)

==== Defining datasource in YAML DSL as a bean

Here is a snippet how you can declare a bean as the `DataSource` for a Postgres database in YAML DSL:

[source,yaml]
----
- beans:
    - name: PostgresqlDataSource
      properties:
        databaseName: "postgres"
        password: "postgres"
        portNumber: "5432"
        serverName: localhost
        user: postgres
      type: org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource
----

You would then also need to add the JAR dependency with Maven coordinates: `org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.3`.

==== Using Spring Boot JDBC data source

In `application.properties` you can set up the datasource such as:

[source,properties]
----
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:sqlserver://db.example.net:1433;databaseName=test_db
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
----

The name of the `DataSource` will be registered with `springDataSource`, however you can configure the name via:

[source,properties]
----
spring.datasource.name=myDataSourceNameHere
----

TIP: Some JDBC drivers are automatic detected by camel-jbang. If not then you need to add the JAR dependency manually.

And you can configure the Hikari connection-pool (if needed) such as:

[source,properties]
----
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=600000
spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=1800000
spring.datasource.hikari.pool-name=collection-pool
----

And you can set logging to DEBUG on hikari to see the actual configuration:

[source,properties]
----
logging.level.com.zaxxer.hikari = DEBUG
----

=== Debugging

There are two kinds of debugging:

* _Java debugging_ - Java code debugging (Standard Java)
* _Camel route debugging_ - Debugging Camel routes (requires Camel tooling plugins)

==== Java debugging

Camel JBang makes it easy to do _Java debugging_ when you run your integration with the `--jvm-debug` option as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.yaml --jmv-debug
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

As you can see the default listening port is 4004 but can be configured as described in https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/debugging.html[JBang Debugging].

This is a standard Java debug socket. You can then use the IDE of your choice. For instance, see the generic documentation for https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/attaching-to-local-process.html#create-rc[IntelliJ], https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging#_attach[VS Code] and https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html#remote-debugging[Eclipse Desktop]. You will surely want to add `Processor` to be able to put breakpoints hit during route execution (as opposed to route definition creation).

===== Standard JBang debugging

You can debug your integration scripts by making use of the `--debug` flag provided by JBang.

[source,bash]
----
jbang --debug  camel@apache/camel run hello.yaml
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

This makes it possible to debug any of the Camel JBang commands, not only the `run` command as shown above.

==== Camel route debugging

With *Camel 4.2* onwards you can now easily debug Camel routes from the command shell with the `debug` command as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml
----

This will run the integration (in background) and the current shell running in foreground will act as a CLI based debugger.
You can see snippets from the log (in the top), the middle section shown the current breakpoint.
And in the bottom you can see content of the message (similar to the `camel trace` command)

----

This is _basic_ but yet powerful, as you have this debugger always readily available, without having to startup VSCode or IDEA tooling.

TIP: The `camel debug` can debug almost all the DSLs (there is a problem with groovy).

===== Configuring breakpoints

When using `camel debug` then breakpoints is by default added to every route. However, you can specify which breakpoints to use instead with the `--breakpoint` option.
This parameter is able to match the Camel routes using a pattern style:

1. Exact match by node ids
2. Match node ids by pattern (wildcard and regular expression)
3. Match by EIP kind (setHeader, setBody, choice, split, etc.)
4. Match by source and line number
5. Match by line number

Multiple breakpoints can be separated by comma.

For example to set a breakpoint at the setHeader EIP you do:

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml --breakpoint=setHeader
----

To set a breakpoint at line 18:

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml --breakpoint=18
----

To set a breakpoint at line 18 and 34

[source,bash]
----
camel debug hello.yaml --breakpoint=18,34
----

==== Editing code using VSCode or IDEA editors

You can use JBang to edit the source code by using the `jbang` CLI to download dependencies
and setup project for being ready to load into an IDE of choice, such as IDEA, VSCode, or Eclipse.

This is typically in use when you use Java DSL and have Camel routes in .java source code.
To let JBang understand which dependencies are in use, then you need to use JBang style for specifying
dependencies by using `//DEPS` code comments in Java code.

Given the following source file in `foo.java` file:

[source,java]
----
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-bom:4.3.0@pom
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-endpointdsl
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-netty-http
//DEPS org.apache.camel:camel-stream

// add more dependencies here

import org.apache.camel.builder.endpoint.EndpointRouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpMessage;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class foo extends EndpointRouteBuilder {

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(foo.class);

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from(timer("trigger").period(5000).repeatCount(3))
                .to(nettyHttp("https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/banks").keepAlive(true))
                .process(e -> {
                    // use classes from camel-netty-http dependency in the source code
                    // and have jbang able to generate project with the dependencies ready
                    // to use in your IDE of choice
                    NettyHttpMessage msg = e.getMessage(NettyHttpMessage.class);
                    LOG.info("Netty HTTP response:\n\n\n{}\n\n\n", msg.getHttpResponse());
                })
                .log("Found bank:")
          .to(stream("out"));
    }
}
----

TIP: You can use `camel dependency update --source=foo.java` to update the dependencies.

Notice how we in the top of the file specify https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/dependencies.html[JBang dependencies] we want JBang to know and prepare for the IDE of choice.
The first `//DEPS` is the `@pom` which set up the Camel version to use.
The following `//DEPS` declares the Camel component we use.

You can now open this source file for editing in your IDE of choice by using jbang CLI as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang edit -b foo.java
----

You can find this example at: https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/jbang-edit

==== Updating dependencies in source code

When working with Java source code, then you can keep the JBang dependencies up-to-date using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel dependency update --source=foo.java
----

TIP: You can use `--clean` to not keep any existing dependencies and generate a clean fresh list.

This will then automatic insert or update the JBang dependencies (`//DEPS`) in the top of the source file.

You may want to use this for making it easier to load the source into an IDE editor to do coding.
See previous section for more details.

==== Camel route debugging using VSCode or IDEA editors

The Camel route debugger is available by default (the `camel-debug` component is automatically added to the classpath). By default, it can be reached through JMX at the URL `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/camel`.

You can then use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. For instance https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9371-apache-camel[IntelliJ], https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel[VS Code] or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textual-debugging-apache-camel[Eclipse Desktop].

A specific how-to is available for VS Code, see this https://youtu.be/owNhWxf42qk[video].

TIP: When exporting to Maven projects, then you can use the maven profile `camel.debug` that will include the `camel-debug` JAR
to make it possible for Camel IDE tools to do Camel route debugging.

==== Health Checks

The status of health checks can be accessed via Camel JBang from the CLI as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health
  PID   NAME    AGE  ID             RL  STATE  RATE    SINCE   MESSAGE
 61005  mybind   8s  camel/context   R   UP    2/2/-  1s/3s/-
----

Here we can see the Camel is _UP_. The application has just been running for 8 seconds, and the
has been 2 health checks invoked.

The output is showing the _default_ level of checks as:

- `CamelContext` health check
- Component specific health checks (such as from `camel-kafka` or `camel-aws`, ...)
- Custom health checks
- Any check which are not UP

The _RATE_ column shows 3 numbers separated by `/`. So `2/2/-` means 2 checks in total, 2 success, - no failures.
The two last columns will reset when a health check changes state as this number is the number of consecutive
checks that was successful or failure. So if the health check starts to fail then the numbers could be:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health
  PID   NAME     AGE   ID             RL  STATE   RATE    SINCE    MESSAGE
 61005  mybind   3m2s  camel/context   R   UP    77/-/3  1s/-/17s  some kind of error
----

Here we can see the numbers is changed to `77/-/3`. This means the total is 77. There is no success, but
the check has been failing 3 times in a row. The _SINCE_ column corresponds to the _RATE_. So in this
case we can see the last check was 1 second ago, and that the check has been failing for 17 second in a row.

You can use `--level=full` to output every health checks; which will include consumer and route level checks
as well.

A health check may often be failed due to an exception was thrown which can be shown via `--trace` flag:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health --trace
  PID   NAME      AGE   ID                                        RL  STATE    RATE       SINCE     MESSAGE

		... 13 more
----

Here we can easily see that the health check is failing because of the `org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigException`
which is due to invalid configuration: `Invalid url in bootstrap.servers: value`.

TIP: Use `camel get health --help` to see all the various options.


== Running with Spring Boot or Quarkus

Camel JBang is __primary__ intended to be Camel standalone only. In *Camel 4.6* onwards we added limited
support for running with Spring Boot or Quarkus, but there are some limitations.

You use the `--runtime` option to specify which platform to use, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=spring-boot
----

And for Quarkus:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=quarkus
----

When running this way, then Camel JBang is _essentially_ doing an _export_ to a temporary folder,
and then running Spring Boot or Quarkus using Maven.

You can do changes to the source file and have Quarkus and Spring Boot reload the routes, just as `camel run --dev` can do,
but uses the natural Spring Boot _dev-tools_ and Quarkus _dev mode_ functionality.

There are several limitations, one would be that Spring Boot and Quarkus cannot automatically detect new components and download JARs.
(you can stop and run again to update dependencies).

When using Quarkus then you can only select the Quarkus version to run, that are locked to a specific Camel version.
You can see the versions by `camel version list --runtime=quarkus`. On the other hand Spring Boot is more flexible
where you can choose different Spring Boot and Camel versions (within reasonable range).

For example:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=spring-boot --spring-boot-version=3.2.3 --camel-version=4.4.1
----

And for Quarkus:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.camel.yaml --runtime=quarkus --quarkus-version=3.9.4
----


== Transforming message (data mapping)

When integrating system you often need to transform messages from one system to another. Camel has rich set
of capabilities for this such as various data formats, templating languages, and much more. However, for basic
data mapping such as taking an existing incoming JSon document and transform this to a smaller JSon document,
you may want to do this quickly with Camel.

The `camel transform message` command can be used for such tasks, where it can take an existing source file as input,
and then a template that defines how to transform the data, and then show the output (in real time).

For example given this JSon document (in a file named `random.json`), we want to combine the name, and select a few fields:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 9914,
  "uid": "eb5fa603-1db6-45f9-912a-431a6ed59b18",
  "password": "ei7gvYKdnN",
  "first_name": "Khalilah",
  "last_name": "Monahan",
  "username": "khalilah.monahan",
  "email": "khalilah.monahan@email.com",
  "avatar": "https://robohash.org/utnumquamexcepturi.png?size=300x300&set=set1",
  "gender": "Agender",
  "phone_number": "+54 (421) 591-5640 x333",
  "social_insurance_number": "268418308",
  "date_of_birth": "1975-03-11",
  "employment": {
    "title": "Product Design Director",
    "key_skill": "Work under pressure"
  },
  "address": {
    "city": "New Fritzchester",
    "street_name": "Patrick Common",
    "street_address": "4538 Reggie Inlet",
    "zip_code": "16282-7045",
    "state": "New York",
    "country": "United States",
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": -1.9868753435474673,
      "lng": 39.09763956726292
    }
  },
  "credit_card": {
    "cc_number": "4493983042212"
  },
  "subscription": {
    "plan": "Student",
    "status": "Active",
    "payment_method": "Debit card",
    "term": "Monthly"
  }
}
----

Then we can have a `transform.json` file as the beginning of the template, with the structure of the desired output:

[source,json]
----
{
    "sid": 123,
	"name": "TODO",
	"country": "TODO",
	"phone": "TODO",
	"student": false
}
----

We can then run `camel transform message` and have it update (in real time) the output every time we change the template.

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:random.json --language=simple --template=file:transform.json --pretty --watch
----

What happens is then Camel will output on the console as you go:

[source,bash]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   23F5DD4CE6C260B-0000000000000002
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 118)
 {
   "sid": 123,
   "name": "TODO",
   "country": "TODO",
   "phone": "TODO",
   "student": false
 }
----

Then you can update the `transform.json` file and save it and see the generated output:

[source,json]
----
{
   "sid": ${jq(.id)},
   "name": "${jq(.first_name)} ${jq(.last_name)}",
   "country": "TODO",
   "phone": "TODO",
   "student": false
}
----

And the output:

[source,bash]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   23F5DD4CE6C260B-0000000000000018
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 158)
 {
   "sid": 9914,
   "name": "Khalilah Monahan",
   "country": "TODO",
   "phone": "TODO",
   "student": false
 }
----

Then you can continue to update the `transform.json` until you have the desired result. And if you make a mistake
then you see an error (in red) with stacktrace that hopefully can help you out how to fix this.

=== Transforming directly from Camel DSL source

In the example above we externalize the transformation into a template file named `transform.json`.
However, it's possible to transform directly in the Camel DSL route.

NOTE: Currently Java DSL is not working in --watch mode (reload on change)

In the following we cover the json-transform example from: https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/json-transform

In this example a random beer is fetched via the beer-source kamelet. The beer data is as follows:

[source,json]
----
 {
   "id": 2104,
   "uid": "cefb36e1-e42f-4083-8f97-fc4ff85e56fb",
   "brand": "Pabst Blue Ribbon",
   "name": "St. Bernardus Abt 12",
   "style": "Belgian Strong Ale",
   "hop": "Amarillo",
   "yeast": "1388 - Belgian Strong Ale",
   "malts": "Caramel",
   "ibu": "43 IBU",
   "alcohol": "3.8%",
   "blg": "16.0°Blg"
 }
----

We save this beer into a file named `sample.json` as we want to use this as source for message transformation.

Now suppose we want to transform this to a smaller JSon document with only a few elements, then we can do this
directly in the route:

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    nodePrefixId: route-c38
    id: route-66b0
    from:
      uri: kamelet:beer-source
      id: from-3996
      steps:
        - setBody:
            expression:
              simple:
                expression: >-
                  TODO
                id: simple-b320
            id: setBody-fa01
        - log:
            message: ${body}
            id: log-0c79
----

As we can see the route has a `setBody` where we want to transform the message, which we can do with the simple
language combined with JQ (or JSonPath). At first, we just write TODO to get started:

[source,bash]
----
camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --source=beer-jq.yaml  --watch --pretty
----

And the output from the transformation is:

[source,text]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   D9F909701338607-0000000000000004
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 4)
 TODO
----

We can now do live updates in the Camel route, and when we save the file, the transform command will output the changes in the terminal.
So we modify the DSL to grab the details we want, such as:

[source,yaml]
----
    expression: >-
      {
        "kind": "${jq(.brand)}",
        "beer": "${jq(.name)}"
      }
    id: simple-b320
----

Notice how we use inlined JQ expressions to grab the desired data from the sample, and when saving the file, we have
the result shown in the terminal:

[source,text]
----
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   D9F909701338607-000000000000003E
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (String) (bytes: 78)
 {
   "kind": "Pabst Blue Ribbon",
   "beer": "St. Bernardus Abt 12"
 }
----

And when we are done with the transformation we can stop by `ctrl + c` to exit the command.

When transforming messages directly from the DSL (using the `--source` option), then by default
Camel will pick the last expression in the route. If you only have one expression like in this example,
then that is easy. But when you have many, then you need to tell which one to use.

You can do this either by referring to the line number in the source code of the EIP / expression, or
by its id (if specified).

So suppose the example had many expressions, and the one we want to use is on line 11, then we can do as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --source=beer-jq.yaml:11  --watch --pretty
----

Notice how we specify the line number in the source file name, by prefixing with `:line-number`.
The line number does not have to be 100% accurate, as long the number is within range of the EIP, until
the next EIP in the route. In the example this means you can pick number in range 8-17.

If we want to use the id of the expression/EIP, we can do the same as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --source=beer-jq.yaml:setBody-fa01  --watch --pretty
----

You can also transform the message from JSon to XML as shown (or any other kind with fixed structure):

[source,yaml]
----
- setBody:
    expression:
      simple:
        expression: >-
          <beer id="${jq(.id)}">
            <name>${jq(.name)}</name>
            <kind>${jq(.brand)}</kind>
          </beer>
        id: simple-b320
    id: setBody-fa01
----

You can configure options that the language format should use, such as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:sample.json --language=jsonpath --template="beer.unknown" --option=suppressExceptions=true
----

TIP: You can specify multiple options by repeating the `--option` argument.

Pay attention that we now use JSONPath as the language, and the template is a tiny json path expression.
Because the sample does not have a `beer.unknown` path, then JSonPath would normally throw an exception.
This can be suppressed by setting the option `suppressExceptions` to `true` as shown above. Then the output is as follows:

[source,text]
----
2023-12-04 13:02:50.923  66291 --- Message transformed (success) (239ms)
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   6118686CA3995FF-0000000000000000
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (null) (bytes: 14)
 [Body is null]
----

=== Transforming message using Components

Some components can also be used for message transformation such as FlatPack, Velocity, FreeMarker, Thymeleaf, and good old XSLT.

TIP: You can use `camel catalog component --filter=transform` to see which components can be transformation.

Given the below XML in the `sample.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<hash>
  <id type="integer">1369</id>
  <uid>8c946e1a-fdc5-40d3-9098-44271bdfad65</uid>
  <account-number>8673088731</account-number>
  <iban>GB38EFUA27474531363797</iban>
  <bank-name>ABN AMRO MEZZANINE (UK) LIMITED</bank-name>
  <routing-number>053228004</routing-number>
  <swift-bic>AACCGB21</swift-bic>
</hash>
----

Then you can transform this using an XSLT named `mystyle.xsl`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version = "1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <bank>
    	<name><xsl:value-of select="/hash/bank-name/text()"/></name>
    	<bic><xsl:value-of select="/hash/swift-bic/text()"/></bic>
    </bank>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
----

Then you can do live changes to the stylesheet and see the output in real-time with Camel JBang by running:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:sample.xml --component=xslt --template=file:mystyle.xsl --pretty --watch
----

You can then edit the `mystyle.xsl` file, and save the file, and watch the terminal for updated result.

You can find this example at: https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/xslt-transform

You can configure options that the XSLT component format should use, such as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:sample.xml --component=xslt --template=file:mystyle.xsl --option=output=bytes --pretty --watch
----

TIP: You can specify multiple options by repeating the `--option` argument.

NOTE: The transform message with component is limited as some components requires configuring complex options that cannot be set from command line.

=== Transforming message using Data Formats

Some data-formats can also be used for message transformation such as Base64, Csv, FlatPack.

TIP: You can use `camel catalog dataformat --filter=transform` to see which components can be transformation.

Given the below CSV file in the `daltons.csv`:

[source,text]
----
Jack Dalton, 115, mad at Averell
Joe Dalton, 105, calming Joe
William Dalton, 105, keeping Joe from killing Averell
Averell Dalton, 80, playing with Rantanplan
Lucky Luke, 120, capturing the Daltons
----

Then you can transform this via Camel CSV dataformat from its form into Java objects (unmarshal).
This will NOT transform the CSV into another format such as XML, but allows you to quickly try out the dataformat,
and be able to inspect the Java object inside Camel.

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:daltons.csv --dataformat=csv
----

This will then output:

[source,text]
----
2023-12-04 10:53:45.578  55793 --- Message transformed (success) (176ms)
 Exchange  (DefaultExchange)  InOut   6673987D34F3B54-0000000000000000
 Message   (DefaultMessage)
 Body      (ArrayList) (size: 5 bytes: 224)
 [[Jack Dalton,  115,  mad at Averell], [Joe Dalton,  105,  calming Joe], [William Dalton,  105,  keeping Joe from killing Averell], [Averell Dalton,  80,
 playing with Rantanplan], [Lucky Luke,  120,  capturing the Daltons]]
----

As you can see Camel CSV dataformat will then unmarshal the input (from CSV file) to a `java.util.ArrayList` object
with 5 elements (one per row), and each row is another List of the columns.

You can configure options that the CSV data format should use, such as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
$ camel transform message --body=file:daltons.csv --dataformat=csv --option=captureHeaderRecord=true
----

TIP: You can specify multiple options by repeating the `--option` argument.

NOTE: The transform message with dataformat is limited as some dataformat requires configuring complex options that cannot be set from command line.

== Transforming routes DSL

Camel offers different DSLs, such as Java, XML, YAML, and more. Many graphical editors and code generators use XML and YAML Camel DSL, therefore, for some use cases it may be required to use one DSL or the other.
The `camel transform route` command can be used to transform a YAML route into an XML and vice versa, the command takes a list of files as input and transforms the DSL.

For example, given the following YAML content, in a file named route.yaml

[source:yaml]
----
- route:
    id: route-b785
    nodePrefixId: route-14b
    from:
      id: from-959e
      uri: direct
      parameters:
        name: start
      steps:
        - choice:
            id: choice-52fe
            when:
              - id: when-b126
                expression:
                  simple:
                    id: simple-576d
                    expression: ${header.foo} == 'bar'
                steps:
                  - to:
                      id: to-65f9
                      uri: jms
                      parameters:
                        destinationName: queue
            otherwise:
              id: otherwise-c07f
              steps:
                - to:
                    id: to-dc76
                    uri: log
                    parameters:
                      loggerName: default
----

The following command

[source:bash]
----
camel transform route --format=xml /path/to/route.yaml
----

Automatically transform the route in XML DSL (Camel XML IO DSL)

[source:xml]
----
<camel>
    <route id="route-b785" nodePrefixId="route-14b">
        <from id="from-959e" uri="direct:start"/>
        <choice id="choice-52fe">
            <when id="when-b126">
                <simple>${header.foo} == 'bar'</simple>
                <to id="to-65f9" uri="jms:queue"/>
            </when>
            <otherwise id="otherwise-c07f">
                <to id="to-dc76" uri="log:default"/>
            </otherwise>
        </choice>
    </route>
</camel>
----

TIP: If all the input files have the same extension and are written with the same DSL, for example, `.yaml`, the transformation will default to the XML DSL and vice versa.

== Listing what Camel components is available

Camel comes with a lot of artifacts out of the box which comes as:

- components
- data formats
- expression languages
- miscellaneous components
- kamelets

You can use the Camel CLI to list what Camel provides via the `camel catalog` command.
For example to list all the components

[source,bash]
----
camel catalog component
----

And to see which Kamelets are available:

[source,bash]
----
camel catalog kamelet
----

TIP: Use `camel catalog --help` to see all possible commands.

=== Displaying component documentation

The `doc` goal can show quick documentation for every component, dataformat, kamelets etc.
For example to see the kafka component you run:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka
----

NOTE: The documentation is not the full documentation as shown on the website, as the Camel CLI does not have direct
access to this information and can only show a basic description of the component, but include tables for every
configuration option.

To see the documentation for jackson dataformat:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc jackson
----

In some rare cases then there may be a component and dataformat with the same name, and the `doc` goal prioritizes
components. In such a situation you can prefix the name with dataformat, i.e:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc dataformat:thrift
----

You can also see the kamelet documentation such as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc aws-kinesis-sink
----

==== Browsing online documentation from the Camel website

You can use the `doc` command to quickly open the url in the web browser for the online documentation.
For example to browse the kafka component, you use `--open-url`:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --open-url
----

This also works for data formats, languages, kamelets etc.

[source,bash]
----
camel doc aws-kinesis-sink --open-url
----

TIP: To just get the link to the online documentation, then use `camel doc kafka --url`.

==== Filtering options listed in the tables

Some components may have many options, and in such cases you may use `--filter` to only list options that match the filter
in either name, description, or the group (producer, security, advanced etc).

For example to list only security related options:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --filter=security
----

And to list only something about _timeout_:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --filter=timeout
----

== Open API

Camel JBang allows to quickly expose an Open API service using _contract first_ approach,
where you have an existing OpenAPI specification file.

Then Camel JBang is able to bridge each API endpoints from the OpenAPI specification to
a Camel route with the naming convention `direct:<operationId>`.

This make it quick to implement a Camel route for a given operation.

See the https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/open-api[open-api example] for more details.

== Gathering list of dependencies

When working with Camel JBang then dependencies are automatically resolved. This means that
you do not have to use a build system like Maven or Gradle to add every Camel components
as a dependency.

However, you may want to know what dependencies are required to run the Camel integration.
To see this, you can use the `dependency` command. The command output does not output a detailed
tree, such as `mvn dependencies:tree`, as the output is intended to list which Camel components,
and other JARs needed (when using Kamelets).

The dependency output by default is _vanilla_ Apache Camel with the camel-main as runtime, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency
org.apache.camel:camel-dsl-modeline:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-health:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-kamelet:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-log:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-rest:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-stream:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-timer:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-yaml-dsl:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets-utils:0.9.3
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets:0.9.3
----

The output is by default a line per maven dependency in GAV format (_groupId:artifactId:version_).

You can also specify the output should be in _Maven format_ as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency --output=maven
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-main</artifactId>
    <version>3.20.0</version>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.kamelets</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-kamelets</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.3</version>
</dependency>
----

You can also choose the target runtime as either _quarkus_ or _spring-boot_ as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency --runtime=spring-boot
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator:2.7.5
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:2.7.5
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-spring-boot-engine-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-dsl-modeline-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-kamelet-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-log-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-rest-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-stream-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-timer-starter:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-yaml-dsl-starter:3.20
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets-utils:0.9.3
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets:0.9.3
----

== Generating SBOM report

[source,bash]

You can generate a SBOM report of your integration by running the following command

----
camel sbom
----

By default it will generate a file named `sbom.json` in `cyclonedx` format.

You can also choose to use an `spdx` format with the following command

----
camel sbom --sbom-format=spdx
----

You can also choose the target runtime as either _quarkus_ or _spring-boot_ as shown:

----
camel sbom --runtime=quarkus
----

or

----
camel sbom --runtime=spring-boot
----

by default `camel-main` will be used

=== Copying dependency JARs to a specific directory

You can use the `camel dependency copy` command to copy the required JARs to a specific folder.

IMPORTANT: The `camel dependency copy` and `camel dependency list` uses Apache Maven,
This requires having Apache Maven installed, and `mvn` command in PATH environment, so Camel JBang
can invoke `mvn` command.

By default, the JARs are copied to `lib` folder:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependency copy
ls lib
camel-api-3.21.0.jar                    camel-health-3.21.0.jar                 camel-yaml-dsl-3.21.0.jar
camel-base-3.21.0.jar                   camel-main-3.21.0.jar                   camel-yaml-dsl-common-3.21.0.jar
camel-base-engine-3.21.0.jar            camel-management-api-3.21.0.jar         camel-yaml-dsl-deserializers-3.21.0.jar
camel-core-engine-3.21.0.jar            camel-rest-3.21.0.jar                   jakarta.activation-api-1.2.2.jar
camel-core-languages-3.21.0.jar         camel-support-3.21.0.jar                jakarta.xml.bind-api-2.3.3.jar
camel-core-model-3.21.0.jar             camel-timer-3.21.0.jar                  slf4j-api-1.7.36.jar
camel-core-processor-3.21.0.jar         camel-tooling-model-3.21.0.jar          snakeyaml-engine-2.3.jar
camel-core-reifier-3.21.0.jar           camel-util-3.21.0.jar
camel-dsl-support-3.21.0.jar            camel-util-json-3.21.0.jar

== Creating Projects

You can _export_ your Camel JBang integration to a traditional Java based project such as Spring Boot or Quarkus.

You may want to do this after you have built a prototype using Camel JBang, and are in need
of a traditional Java based project with more need for Java coding, or wanting to use the powerful
runtimes of Spring Boot, Quarkus or vanilla Camel Main.

=== Exporting to Camel Spring Boot

The command `export --runtime=spring-boot` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
Spring Boot project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Spring Boot using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

When exporting to Spring Boot then the Camel version defined in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` is
the same version as Camel JBang uses. However, you can specify the Camel version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject --camel-spring-boot-version=3.18.3
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

=== Exporting to Camel Quarkus

The command `export --runtime=quarkus` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
Quarkus project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Quarkus using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

NOTE: You cannot use `--profile` option when exporting to Camel Quarkus.

=== Exporting to Camel Main

The command `export --runtime=camel-main` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
vanilla Camel Main project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Camel Main using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

==== Exporting with Java Agent included

The Camel Main runtime allows to export with Java Agents that makes it easier to run your Camel integration
with Java Agents such as OpenTelemetry Agent.

NOTE: Only `camel-main` as runtime supports exporting with Java Agents included.

This requires to specify the agent as a dependency with `agent:` as prefix as shown below in `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
camel.jbang.dependencies=camel:opentelemetry,agent:io.opentelemetry.javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent:1.31.0
camel.opentelemetry.enabled=true
----

Then you can export to `--runtime=camel-main` as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

Then Camel JBang will detect the `agent:` dependency and download this from Maven and save to a `../myproject/agent` folder.
You can then start the Camel integration from Java via:

[source,bash]
----
cd ../myproject
mvn clean package
java -javaagent:agent/opentelemetry-javaagent-1.31.0.jar -jar target/acme-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

=== Exporting with selected files

By default, Camel will export what was last run, or all files from the current directory.
You can also explicit specify which files should be exported.

For example, you may have 3 files in a folder:

- Foo.java
- bar.xml
- cheese.yaml

These are 3 Camel routes, and you want to export them into 2 different applications:

[source,bash]
----
camel export Foo.java --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../export1
camel export bar.xml cheese.yaml --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:cheese:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../export2
----

As you can see the first export command will only include `Foo.java`, and then 2nd export includes both `bar.xml` and `cheese.yaml`.

NOTE: If you have `application.properties` in the folder as well, then this will be included in both exports.

=== Exporting as Gradle Project

Camel JBang exports by default as a Maven based project. To use Gradle instead, you can
specify the `--build-tool=gradle` when exporting, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --build-tool=gradle --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

=== Exporting with JMX management included

Usually when exporting to Spring Boot, Quarkus or Camel Main, then JMX management is not included out of the box.
To include JMX, you need to add `camel:management` in the `--deps` option, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --deps=camel:management --directory=../myproject
----

=== Exporting with Camel CLI included

Usually when exporting to Spring Boot, Quarkus or Camel Main, then Camel JBang CLI is not included out of the box.
To be able to continue to use Camel CLI (i.e. `camel`), you need to add `camel:cli-connector` in the `--deps` option, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --deps=camel:cli-connector --directory=../myproject
----

=== Configuring exporting

The export command will by default load configuration from `application.properties`
which also can be used to specific parameters for export such as selecting the runtime and java version.

The follow options related to _exporting_, can be configured in `application.properties`:

|===

NOTE: These are options from the export command, so you can see more details and default values using `camel export --help`.

== Configuration

Camel JBang `config` command is used to store and use the user configuration. This eliminates the need to specify CLI options each time. For example, to run a different Camel version, instead of executing

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --camel-version=3.18.4
----

the camel-version can be added to the user configuration such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel config set camel-version=3.18.4
----

Now, the run command picks the user configuration:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

The user configuration file is stored in `~/.camel-jbang-user.properties`

IMPORTANT: You cannot use both a set version via `camel config set` and also a version specified via `--camel-version` option,
i.e the following is not possible:

[source,bash]
----
camel config set camel-version=4.0.1
camel run * --camel-version=4.3.0
----

=== Set and unset configuration

Every Camel JBang option is added to the user configuration. For example, to export a simple project such as

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.yaml
camel config set gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
camel config set runtime=spring-boot
camel config set deps=org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-timer-starter
camel config set camel-spring-boot-version=3.20.1

camel export
----

User configuration keys are unset using the following:

[source,bash]
----
camel config unset camel-spring-boot-version
----

=== List and get configurations

User configuration keys are listed using the following:

[source,bash]
----
camel config list
----

Following is the output for the above mentioned configuration.

[source,bash]
----
runtime = spring-boot
deps = org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-timer-starter
gav = com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

To obtain a value for the given key, use the `get` command.

[source,bash]
----
camel config get gav

com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

=== Placeholders substitutes

User configuration values can be used as placeholder substitutes with command line properties, for example:

[source,bash]
----
camel config set repos=https://maven.repository.my.repo.com/ga

camel run 'Test.java' --logging-level=info --repos=#repos,https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

In this example, since `repos` is set in the user configuration (`config set`) and the `camel run` command declares the placeholder `#repos`, `camel run` will replace the placeholder so that both repositories will be used during the execution.
Notice, that to refer to the configuration value the syntax is `#optionName` eg `#repos`.

NOTE: The placeholder substitution only works for every option that a given Camel command has.
You can see all the options a command has via the help, eg `camel run --help`.


== Troubleshooting

When using https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] then JBang stores state in `~/.jbang` directory.
This is also the location where JBang stores downloaded JARs.

Camel JBang also downloads needed dependencies while running. However, these dependencies
are downloaded to your local Maven repository `~/.m2`.

So if you find problems with running Camel JBang using what is seems like an outdated JAR, then you can
try to delete these directories, or parts of it.
