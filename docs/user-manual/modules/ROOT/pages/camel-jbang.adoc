= Camel JBang

A JBang-based Camel app for easily running Camel routes.

== Installation

First you must install https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] which is used for launching Camel.
See instructions on https://www.jbang.dev/download/[JBang] how to download and install.

After JBang is installed you can verify JBang is working by executing the following command from a command shell:

[source,bash]
----
jbang version
----

Which should output the version of JBang.

To make it easier to use Camel JBang then install the following:

[source,bash]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

This will install Apache Camel as the `camel` command within JBang, meaning that you can run Camel from the command line
by just executing `camel` (see more next).

== Using Camel JBang

The Camel JBang supports multiple commands. Running the command below, will print all of them:

[source,bash]
----
camel --help
----

TIP: The first time you run this command, it may cause dependencies to be cached, therefore taking a few extra seconds to run.

All the commands support the `--help` and will display the appropriate help if that flag is provided.

=== Enable shell completion

Camel JBang provides shell completion for bash and zsh out of the box. To enable shell completion for Camel JBang, run:

[source,bash]
----
source <(camel completion)
----

To make it permanent, run:

[source,bash]
----
echo 'source <(camel completion)' >> ~/.bashrc
----

== Creating and running Camel routes

You can create a new basic routes with the `init` command.

For example to create an XML route you do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init cheese.xml
----

Which creates the file `cheese.xml` (in the current directory) with a sample route.

To run the file, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run cheese.xml
----

NOTE: You can create and run any of the supported xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] in Camel such as YAML, XML, Java, Groovy.

To create a new .java route, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java
----

When using the init command then Camel will by default create the file in the current directory. However, you can use
the `--directory` option to create the file in the specified directory. For example to create in a folder
named _foobar_ you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java --directory=foobar
----

IMPORTANT: When using `--directory` then Camel will automatically clean this directory if already exists.

=== Running Routes from multiple files

You can run more than 1 file, for example to run two YAML files you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml two.yaml
----

You can also mix different xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] such as yaml and Java:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml hello.java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the yaml files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *.yaml
----

Or you can run all files starting with foo*

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo*
----

And to run everything

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

TIP: The run goal can also detect files that are `properties`, such as `application.properties`.

=== Running Route from input parameter

For very small Java routes then it is possible to provide the route as CLI argument, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --code='from("kamelet:beer-source").to("log:beer")'
----

This is very limited as the CLI argument is a bit cumbersome to use than files.

- Java DSL code is only supported
- Code wrapped in single quote, so you can use double quote in Java DSL
- Code limited to what literal values possible to provide from the terminal and JBang.
- All route(s) must be defined in a single `--code` parameter.

NOTE: Using `--code` is only usable for very quick and small prototypes.

=== Dev mode with live reload

You can enable dev mode that comes with live reload of the route(s) when the source file is updated (saved),
using the `--dev` options as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.yaml --dev
----

Then while the Camel integration is running, you can update the YAML route and update when saving.

This works for all DLS even java, so you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --dev
----

NOTE: The live reload is meant for development purposes, and if you encounter problems with reloading
such as JVM class loading issues, then you may need to restart the integration.

=== Developer Console

You can enable the developer console, which presents a variety of information to the developer.

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --console
----

The console is then accessible from a web browser at: http://localhost:8080/q/dev (by default).
The link is also shown in the log when Camel is starting up.

The console can give you insights into your running Camel integration, such as reporting the top
routes that takes the longest time to process messages. You can then drill down to pin-point, exactly
which individual EIPs in these routes are the slowest.

The developer console can also output the data in JSon format, which for example can be used by 3rd-party tooling
to scrape the information.

For example to output the top routes via curl, you can execute:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json"  http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/dev/top/
----

And if you have `jq` installed which can format and output the JSon data in colour, then do:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json"  http://0.0.0.0:8080/q/dev/top/ | jq
----

=== Using profiles

Camel JBang have the concept of profiles. A _profile_ is essentially a name (id) that refers
to which configuration to automatic load with Camel JBang. The default profile is named `application`
which is a (smart default) to let Camel JBang automatic load `application.properties` (if present).

This means that creating profiles matching to a properties file with the same name.

For example having a profile named `local`, means that Camel JBang will load `local.properties` instead
of `application.properties`.

To use a profile, you specify as command line option `--profile` such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --profile=local
----

You can only specify one profile name, i.e. `--profile=local,two` is not valid.

In the `properties` files you can configure all
the configurations from xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main].

For example to turn off xref:stream-caching.adoc[Stream Caching] and enable log masking you can specify:

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.streamCaching=false
camel.main.logMask=true
----

And you can also configure Camel components such as camel-kafka to declare the URL to the brokers:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.kafka.brokers=broker1:9092,broker2:9092,broker3:9092
----

NOTE: Keys starting with `camel.jbang` are reserved keys that are used by Camel JBang internally,
and as well allow for pre-configuring arguments for Camel JBang commands.

=== Downloading JARs over the internet

By default, Camel JBang will automatically resolve dependencies needed to run Camel, which is done
by JBang and Camel respectively. Camel itself detects at runtime if a component has a need for JARs that
are not currently available on the classpath, and can then automatic download the JARs (incl transitive).

Camel will download these JARs in the following order:

1. from local disk in `~/.m2/repository`
2. from internet in Maven Central
3. from internet in custom 3rd-party Maven repositories
4. from all the repositories found in active profiles of `~/.m2/settings.xml` or a settings file specified using
`--maven-settings` option.

If you do not want Camel JBang to download over the internet, you can turn this off with `--download`, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --download=false
----

[#_adding_custom_jars]
=== Adding custom JARs

Camel JBang will automatically detect dependencies for Camel components, languages, data formats, etc. that
from its own release. This means you often do not have to specify which JARs to use.

However, if you need to add 3rd-party custom JARs then you can specify these with `--deps` as CLI argument in Maven
GAV syntax (`groupId:artifactId:version`), such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=com.foo:acme:1.0
----

In case you need to explicit add a Camel dependency you can use a shorthand syntax (starting with `camel:` or `camel-`)
such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=camel-saxon
----

You can specify multiple dependencies separated by comma:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=camel-saxon,com.foo:acme:1.0
----

=== Using 3rd-party Maven repositories

Camel JBang will download from local repository first, and then online from Maven Central.
To be able to download from 3rd-party Maven repositories then you need to specify this as CLI argument,
]or in `application.properties`

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --repos=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

TIP: Multiple repositories can be separated by comma

The configuration for the 3rd-party Maven repositories can also be configured in `application.properties`
with the key `camel.jbang.repos` as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.jbang.repos=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

And when running Camel then `application.properties` is automatically loaded:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
----

However, you can also explicit specify the properties file to use:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java application.properties
----

And even better if you specify this as a profile:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --profile=application
----

Where the profile id is the name of the properties file.


=== Configuration of Maven usage

By default, existing `~/.m2/settings.xml` file is loaded, so it is possible to alter the behaviour of Maven resolution
process. Maven settings file can provide information about Maven mirrors, credential configuration (potentially
encrypted) or active profiles and additional repositories.

Maven repositories can use authentication and the Maven-way to configure credentials is through `<server>` elements,
like this:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
    <id>external-repository</id>
    <username>camel</username>
    <password>{SSVqy/PexxQHvubrWhdguYuG7HnTvHlaNr6g3dJn7nk=}</password>
</server>
----

While the password may be specified using plain text, it's better to configure maven master password first and then
use it to configure repository password:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn -emp
[INFO] BuildTimeEventSpy is registered.
Master password: camel
{hqXUuec2RowH8dA8vdqkF6jn4NU9ybOsDjuTmWvYj4U=}
----

The above password should be added to `~/.m2/settings-security.xml` file like this:

[source,xml]
----
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{hqXUuec2RowH8dA8vdqkF6jn4NU9ybOsDjuTmWvYj4U=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
----

Then a normal password can be configured like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn -ep
[INFO] BuildTimeEventSpy is registered.
Password: camel
{SSVqy/PexxQHvubrWhdguYuG7HnTvHlaNr6g3dJn7nk=}
----

Finally, such password can be used in `<server>/<password>` configuration.

By default, Maven reads the master password from `~/.m2/settings-security.xml` file, but we can override it.
Location of the settings.xml file itself can be specified as well:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=/path/to/settings.xml --maven-settings-security=/path/to/settings-security.xml
----

If you want to run Camel application without assuming any location (even `~/.m2/settings.xml`), use this option:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --maven-settings=false
----


=== Running routes hosted on GitHub

You can run a route that is hosted on GitHub using Camels xref:components:others:resourceresolver-github.adoc[github] resource loader.

For example to run one of the Camel K examples you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run github:apache:camel-kamelets-examples:jbang/hello-java/Hey.java
----

You can also use the `https` URL for GitHub. For example, you can browse the examples from a web-browser and
then copy the URL from the browser window and run the example with Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/hello-java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the groovy files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/languages/*.groovy
----

Or you can run all files starting with rou*

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/languages/rou*
----

==== Running routes from GitHub gists

Using gists from GitHub is a quick way to share small Camel routes that you can easily run.

For example to run a gist you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

A gist can contain one or more files, and Camel JBang will gather all relevant files, so a gist
can contain multiple routes, properties files, Java beans, etc.

=== Downloading routes hosted on GitHub

We have made it easy for Camel JBang to download existing examples from GitHub to local disk,
which allows for modifying the example and to run locally.

All you need to do is to copy the https link from the web browser.
For example, you can download the _dependency injection_ example by:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection
----

Then the files (not sub folders) are downloaded to the current directory.
The example can then be run locally with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also download to a new folder using the `--directory` option, for example to download to a folder named _myproject_,
you would do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection --directory=myproject
----

IMPORTANT: When using `--directory` then Camel will automatically clean this directory if already exists.

You can also run in dev mode, to hot-deploy on source code changes.

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --dev
----

You can also download a single file, such as one of the Camel K examples:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-k-examples/blob/main/generic-examples/languages/simple.groovy
----

This is a groovy route, which you can run with (or use `*`):

[source,bash]
----
camel run simple.groovy
----

==== Downloading routes form GitHub gists

You can also download files from gists easily as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

This will then download the files to local disk, which you can run afterwards:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also download to a new folder using the `--directory` option, for example to download to a folder named _foobar_,
you would do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92 --directory=foobar
----

IMPORTANT: When using `--directory` then Camel will automatically clean this directory if already exists.


=== Using a specific Camel version

You can specify which Camel version to run as shown:

[source,bash]
----
jbang run -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.17.0 camel@apache/camel [command]
----

NOTE: Older versions of Camel may not work as well with Camel JBang as the newest versions.
Starting from Camel 3.18 onwards is the versions that are recommended to be used onwards.

And you can also try bleeding edge development by using SNAPSHOT such as:

[source,bash]
----
jbang run --fresh -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.20.0-SNAPSHOT camel@apache/camel [command]
----


=== Running Camel K integrations or bindings

Camel also supports running Camel K integrations and binding files, which are in CRD format (Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions).

For example a kamelet binding file named `joke.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
#!/usr/bin/env jbang camel@apache/camel run
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 2000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
    properties:
      show-headers: false
----

Can be run with camel:

[source,bash]
----
camel run joke.yaml
----

=== Run from clipboard

You can also run Camel routes directly from the OS clipboard. This allows to copy some code,
and then quickly run this.

The syntax is

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.<extension>
----

Where `<extension>` is what kind of file the content of the clipboard is, such as `java`, `xml`, or `yaml` etc.

For example. you can copy this to your clipboard and then run it afterwards:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="timer:foo"/>
  <log message="Hello World"/>
</route>
----

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.xml
----

=== Controlling local Camel integrations

To list the currently running Camel integrations you use the `ps` command:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps
  PID   NAME                          READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica…   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude                           1/1   Running   4m34s
----

This lists the PID, the name and age of the integration.

You can use the `stop` command to stop any of these running Camel integrations.
For example to stop dude, you can do

[source,bash]
----
camel stop dude
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

You can also stop by the PID:

[source,bash]
----
camel stop 62506
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

TIP: You do not have to type the full name, as the stop command will match using integrations
that starts with the input, for example you can do `camel stop d` to stop all integrations
starting with d.

To stop all integrations then you need to use the `--all` option as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel stop --all
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 61818)
Stopping running Camel integration (pid: 62506)
----

==== Controlling Spring Boot and Quarkus integrations

The Camel JBang CLI will by default only control Camel integrations that are running using the CLI, eg `camel run foo.java`.

For the CLI to be able to control and manage Spring Boot or Quarkus applications, then you need to add a dependency
to these projects to integrate with Camel CLI.

In Spring Boot you add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-cli-connector-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In Quarkus you need to add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-cli-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

==== Getting status of Camel integrations

The `get` command in Camel JBang is used for getting Camel specific status for one
or all of the running Camel integrations.

To display the status of the running Camel integrations:

[source,bash]
----
camel get
  PID   NAME      CAMEL            PLATFORM            READY  STATUS    AGE    TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  SINCE-LAST
 61818  MyCamel   3.20.0-SNAPSHOT  Spring Boot v2.7.3   1/1   Running  28m34s    854       0         0     0s/0s/-
 63051  dude      3.20.0-SNAPSHOT  JBang                1/1   Running     18s     14       0         0     0s/0s/-
 63068  mygroovy  3.20.0-SNAPSHOT  JBang                1/1   Running      5s      2       0         0     0s/0s/-
----

The `camel get` command will default display integrations, which is equivalent to
typing `camel get integrations` or `camel get int`.

This displays overall information for every Camel integration, where you can see
the total number of messages processed. The column _Since Last_
shows how long time ago the last processed message for 3 stages (started/completed/failed).

The value of `0s/0s/-` means that the last started and completed message just happened (0 seconds ago),
and  that there has not been any failed message yet. And this example `9s/9s/1h3m` means that last started and
completed message is 9 seconds ago, and last failed is 1 hour and 3 minutes ago.

You can also see the status of every routes, from all the local Camel integrations with `camel get route`:

[source,bash]
----
camel get route
  PID   NAME      ID      FROM                        STATUS    AGE   TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST
 61818  MyCamel   hello   timer://hello?period=2000   Running  29m2s    870       0         0     0    0   14     0s/0s/-
 63051  dude      java    timer://java?period=1000    Running    46s     46       0         0     0    0    9     0s/0s/-
 63068  mygroovy  groovy  timer://groovy?period=1000  Running    34s     34       0         0     0    0    5     0s/0s/-
----

TIP: Use `camel get --help` to display all the available commands as additional will be added in upcoming releases.

==== Top status of Camel integrations

The `camel top` command is intended for getting top utilization statistics (highest to lowest heap used memory)
of the running Camel integrations.

[source,bash]
----
camel top
  PID   NAME     JAVA     CAMEL            PLATFORM            STATUS    AGE         HEAP        NON-HEAP     GC     THREADS   CLASSES
 22104  chuck    11.0.13  3.20.0-SNAPSHOT  JBang               Running   2m10s  131/322/4294 MB  70/73 MB  17ms (6)      7/8  7456/7456
 14242  MyCamel  11.0.13  3.20.0-SNAPSHOT  Spring Boot v2.7.3  Running  33m40s  115/332/4294 MB  62/66 MB  37ms (6)    16/16  8428/8428
 22116  bar      11.0.13  3.20.0-SNAPSHOT  JBang               Running    2m7s   33/268/4294 MB  54/58 MB  20ms (4)      7/8  6104/6104
----

The _HEAP_ column shows the heap memory (used/committed/max) and the non-heap (used/committed).
The _GC_ column shows garbage collection information (time and total runs).
The _CLASSES_ column shows number of classes (loaded/total).

You can also see the top performing routes (highest to lowest mean processing time)
of every routes, from all the local Camel integrations with `camel top route`:

[source,bash]
----
camel top route
  PID   NAME     ID                     FROM                                 STATUS    AGE    TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST
 22104  chuck    chuck-norris-source-1  timer://chuck?period=10000           Started     10s      1       0         0   163  163  163          9s
 22116  bar      route1                 timer://yaml2?period=1000            Started      7s      7       0         0     1    0   11          0s
 22104  chuck    chuck                  kamelet://chuck-norris-source        Started     10s      1       0         0     0    0    0          9s
 22104  chuck    log-sink-2             kamelet://source?routeId=log-sink-2  Started     10s      1       0         0     0    0    0          9s
 14242  MyCamel  hello                  timer://hello?period=2000            Started  31m41s    948       0         0     0    0    4          0s
----

TIP: Use `camel top --help` to display all the available commands as additional will be added in upcoming releases.

==== Starting and Stopping routes

The `camel cmd` is intended for executing miscellaneous commands in the running Camel integrations.
For example there are commands to start and stop routes.

To stop all the routes in the chuck integration, you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stop-route chuck
----

And the status will then report the status as _Stopped_ for the chuck integration:

[source,bash]
----
camel get route
  PID   NAME     ID                     FROM                                 STATUS    AGE   TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  MEAN  MIN  MAX  SINCE-LAST

----

To start the routes, you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route chuck
----

To stop _all_ routes in every Camel integration you need to use the `--all` flag as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd stop-route --all
----

And you can start _all_ routes using:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd start-route --all
----

TIP: You can stop one or more route by their ids by separating using
comma such as: camel cmd start-route --id=route1,hello. Use `camel cmd start-route --help` for more details.

==== Configuring logging levels

You can see the current logging levels of the running Camel integrations by:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd logger
  PID   NAME   AGE   LOGGER  LEVEL
 90857  bar   2m48s  root    INFO
 91103  foo     20s  root    INFO
----

The logging level can be change at runtime, for example to change foo to DEBUG you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel cmd logger --level=DEBUG foo
----

TIP: You can use `--all` to change logging levels for all running integrations.

==== Listing services

Some Camel integrations may host a service which clients can call, such as REST, or SOAP-WS, or socket-level services using TCP protocols.

You can list the available services as shown in the example below:

[source,bash]
----
camel get service
 PID   NAME       COMPONENT      PROTOCOL  SERVICE
 1912  netty      netty          tcp       tcp:localhost:4444
 2023  greetings  platform-http  rest      http://0.0.0.0:7777/camel/greetings/{name} (GET)
 2023  greetings  platform-http  http      http://0.0.0.0:7777/q/dev
----

Here you can see 2 Camel integrations. The netty integration hosts a TCP service that is available on port 4444.
The other Camel integration hosts a REST service that can be called via GET only.
And finally the integration comes with embedded web console (started with the `--console` option).

NOTE: For a service to be listed then Camel components must be able to advertise the services using xref:camel-console.adoc[].

==== Listing state of Circuit Breakers

If your Camel integration uses xref:components:eips:circuitBreaker-eip.adoc[Circuit Breaker] then
you can output the status of the breakers with Camel JBang as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel get circuit-breaker
  PID   NAME  COMPONENT     ROUTE   ID               STATE      PENDING  SUCCESS  FAIL  REJECT
 56033  mycb  resilience4j  route1  circuitBreaker1  HALF_OPEN        5        2     3       0
----

Here we can see the circuit breaker is in _half open_ state, i.e. a state where the breaker is attempting
to transition back to closed, if the failures start to drop.

TIP: You can run the command with watch to keep showing the latest state `watch camel get circuit-breaker`.

=== Using Jolokia and Hawtio

The https://hawt.io/[Hawtio] web console allows inspecting running Camel integrations, such
as all the JMX management information, and not but least to visualize the Camel routes
with live performance metrics. Hawtio is a handy tool for many years, and we have made it
easy to use Hawtio with Camel JBang.

To let Hawtio able to inspect the Camel integrations, then the Jolokia JVM Agent
must be installed in the running integration, this can be done, either explicit as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel ps
  PID   NAME                          READY  STATUS    AGE
 61818  sample.camel.MyCamelApplica…   1/1   Running  26m38s
 62506  dude.java                      1/1   Running   4m34s
----

With the PID you can then attach Jolokia:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia 62506
Started Jolokia for PID 62506
http://127.0.0.1:8778/jolokia/
----

Instead of using PID you can also attach by name pattern. In this example because the
two Camel integrations have unique names (foo and dude), then you can also attach Jolokia
without knowing the PID as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia du
Started Jolokia for PID 62506
http://127.0.0.1:8778/jolokia/
----

Then you can launch https://hawt.io/[Hawtio] using Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel hawtio
----

This will automatically download and start Hawtio, and open in web browser.

TIP: See `camel hawtio --help` for options.

And when Hawtio launches in the web browser, click the _Discover_ tab which should
list all the local available Jolokia Agents (yes you can use `camel jolokia PID` to connect
to multiple different Camel integrations and from this list select which to load).

Click the green _lightning_ icon to connect to running Camel integration (of choice).

You can uninstall the Jolokia JVM Agent in a running Camel integration when no longer needed:

[source,bash]
----
camel jolokia 62506 --stop
Stopped Jolokia for PID 62506
----

It is also possible to do this with only one command, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel hawtio dude
----

Where _dude_ is the name of the running Camel integration. When you stop Hawtio (using `ctrl` + `c`)
then Camel will attempt to uninstall the Jolokia JVM Agent, however this may not be
able to do this always, because the JVM is being terminated which can prevent camel-jbang
from doing JVM process communication to the running Camel integration.

=== Scripting from terminal using pipes

You can also execute a Camel JBang file as a script that can be used for terminal scripting with pipes and filters.

NOTE: Every time the script is executed a JVM is started with Camel. This is not very fast or low on memory usage,
so use Camel JBang terminal scripting where using Camel makes sense. For example to use the
many Camel components or Kamelets to more easily send or receive data from disparate IT systems.

This requires to add the following line in top of the file, for example as in the `upper.yaml` file below:

[source,text]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang --quiet camel@apache/camel pipe "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

# Will upper-case the input
- from:
    uri: "stream:in"
    steps:
      - setBody:
          simple: "${body.toUpperCase()}"
      - to: "stream:out"
----

To be able to execute this as a script, you need to set execute file permission:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x upper.yaml
----

Then you can then execute this as a script:

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./upper.yaml
----

Which should output:

[source,text]
----
HELLO
WORLD
----

Logging can be turned on using `--logging=true` which then logs to `.camel-jbang/camel-pipe.log` file.
The name of the logging file cannot be configured.

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./upper.yaml --logging=true
----

==== Using stream:in with line vs raw mode

When using `stream:in` to read data from _System in_ then the xref:components::stream-component.adoc[Stream component]
works in two modes:

- line mode (default) - reads input as single lines (separated by line breaks).
  Message body is a `String`.
- raw mode - reads the entire stream until _end of stream_.
  Message body is a `byte[]`.

IMPORTANT: The default mode is due to historically how the stream component was created.
Therefore, you may want to set `stream:in?readLine=false` to use raw mode.

=== Running local Kamelets

You can also use Camel JBang to try local Kamelets, without the need to publish them on GitHub or package them in a jar.

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=/path/to/local/kamelets earthquake.yaml
----

TIP: When the kamelets are from local file system, then they can be live reloaded, if they are updated, when you run
Camel JBang in `--dev` mode.

You can also point to a folder in a GitHub repository. For example, we have provided some custom Kamelets
at https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets which can be used easily:

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/custom-kamelets user.java
----

NOTE: If a kamelet is loaded from GitHub, then they cannot be live reloaded.

=== Using platform-http component

When a route is started from `platform-http` then Camel JBang will automatically include a VertX HTTP server
running on port 8080. For example the following route in a file named `server.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "platform-http:/hello"
    steps:
      - set-body:
          constant: "Hello World"
----

Can be run with

[source,bash]
----
camel run server.yaml
----

And you can call the HTTP service with:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello World%
----

=== Using Java beans and processors

There is basic support for including regular Java source files together with Camel routes,
and let Camel JBang runtime compile the Java source. This means you can include smaller utility
classes, POJOs, Camel Processors and whatnot that the application needs.

IMPORTANT: The Java source files cannot use package names. This may change in the future.

=== Dependency Injection in Java classes

When running Camel integrations with camel-jbang, then the runtime is `camel-main` based. This means
there is no Spring Boot, or Quarkus available. However, we have added support for using annotation
based dependency injection in Java classes.

==== Using Camel dependency injection

You can use the following Camel annotations on Camel standalone:

- `@org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@org.apache.camel.Configuration` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].

And these annotations should work on all runtimes
(if target runtime is either Quarkus or Spring Boot then favour using their annotations):

- `@org.apache.camel.BeanInject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field.
- `@org.apache.camel.PropertyInject` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.
- `@org.apache.camel.Converter` on class level to auto-register the xref:type-converter.adoc[type converters] from the class.

==== Using Spring Boot dependency injection

You can use the following Spring Boot annotations:

- `@org.springframework.stereotype.Component` or `@org.springframework.stereotype.Service` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.

==== Using Quarkus injection

You can use the following Quarkus annotations:

- `@javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` or `@javax.inject.Singleton` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@javax.inject.Inject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method. `@javax.inject.Named` can be used to specify the bean id.

=== Debugging

There are two kinds of debugging:

* _Java debugging_ - Java code debugging (Standard Java)
* _Camel route debugging_ - Debugging Camel routes (requires Camel tooling plugins)

==== Java debugging

You can debug your integration scripts by making use of the `--debug` flag provided by JBang.
However, due to Java debugging must be enabled when starting the JVM, then you must do this
using the `jbang` command, instead of `camel` as shown:

[source,bash]
----
jbang --debug  camel@apache/camel run hello.yaml
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

As you can see the default listening port is 4004 but can be configured as described in https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/debugging.html[JBang Debugging].

This is a standard Java debug socket. You can then use the IDE of your choice. For instance, see the generic documentation for https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/attaching-to-local-process.html#create-rc[IntelliJ], https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging#_attach[VS Code] and https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html#remote-debugging[Eclipse Desktop]. You will surely want to add `Processor` to be able to put breakpoints hit during route execution (as opposed to route definition creation).

==== Camel route debugging

The Camel route debugger is available by default (the `camel-debug` component is automatically added to the classpath). By default, it can be reached through JMX at the URL `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/camel`.

You can then use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. For instance https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9371-apache-camel[IntelliJ], https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel[VS Code] or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textual-debugging-apache-camel[Eclipse Desktop].

A specific how-to is available for VS Code, see this https://youtu.be/owNhWxf42qk[video] or this /blog/2022/05/start-camel-quarkus-application-with-camel-textual-debug-in-vscode/[blogpost].

==== Health Checks

The status of health checks can be accessed via Camel JBang from the CLI as follows:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health
  PID   NAME    AGE  ID             RL  STATE  RATE    SINCE   MESSAGE
 61005  mybind   8s  camel/context   R   UP    2/2/-  1s/3s/-
----

Here we can see the Camel is _UP_. The application has just been running for 8 seconds, and the
has been 2 health checks invoked.

The output is showing the _default_ level of checks as:

- `CamelContext` health check
- Component specific health checks (such as from `camel-kafka` or `camel-aws`, ...)
- Custom health checks
- Any check which are not UP

The _RATE_ column shows 3 numbers separated by `/`. So `2/2/-` means 2 checks in total, 2 success, - no failures.
The two last columns will reset when a health check changes state as this number is the number of consecutive
checks that was successful or failure. So if the health check starts to fail then the numbers could be:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health
  PID   NAME     AGE   ID             RL  STATE   RATE    SINCE    MESSAGE
 61005  mybind   3m2s  camel/context   R   UP    77/-/3  1s/-/17s  some kind of error
----

Here we can see the numbers is changed to `77/-/3`. This means the total is 77. There is no success, but
the check has been failing 3 times in a row. The _SINCE_ column corresponds to the _RATE_. So in this
case we can see the last check was 1 second ago, and that the check has been failing for 17 second in a row.

You can use `--level=full` to output every health checks; which will include consumer and route level checks
as well.

A health check may often be failed due to an exception was thrown which can be shown via `--trace` flag:

[source,bash]
----
camel get health --trace
  PID   NAME      AGE   ID                                      RL  STATE    RATE       SINCE     MESSAGE
 61038  mykafka  6m19s  camel/context                            R   UP    187/187/-  1s/6m16s/-

----

Here we can easily see that the health check is failing because of the `org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigException`
which is due to invalid configuration: `Invalid url in bootstrap.servers: value`.

TIP: Use `camel get health --help` to see all the various options.

== Listing what Camel components is available

Camel comes with a lot of artifacts out of the box which comes as:

- components
- data formats
- expression languages
- miscellaneous components
- kamelets

You can use the Camel CLI to list what Camel provides via the `camel catalog` command.
For example to list all the components

[source,bash]
----
camel catalog components
----

And to see which Kamelets are available:

[source,bash]
----
camel catalog kamelets
----

TIP: Use `camel catalog --help` to see all possible commands.

=== Displaying component documentation

The `doc` goal can show quick documentation for every component, dataformat, kamelets etc.
For example to see the kafka component you run:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka
----

NOTE: The documentation is not the full documentation as shown on the website, as the Camel CLI does not have direct
access to this information and can only show a basic description of the component, but include tables for every
configuration option.

To see the documentation for jackson dataformat:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc jackson
----

In some rare cases then there may be a component and dataformat with the same name, and the `doc` goal prioritizes
components. In such a situation you can prefix the name with dataformat, i.e:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc dataformat:thrift
----

You can also see the kamelet documentation such as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc aws-kinesis-sink
----

==== Browsing online documentation from the Camel website

You can use the `doc` command to quickly open the url in the web browser for the online documentation.
For example to browse the kafka component, you use `--open-url`:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --open-url
----

This also works for data formats, languages, kamelets etc.

[source,bash]
----
camel doc aws-kinesis-sink --open-url
----

TIP: To just get the link to the online documentation, then use `camel doc kafka --url`.

==== Filtering options listed in the tables

Some components may have many options, and in such cases you may use `--filter` to only list options that match the filter
in either name, description, or the group (producer, security, advanced etc).

For example to list only security related options:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --filter=security
----

And to list only something about _timeout_:

[source,bash]
----
camel doc kafka --filter=timeout
----

== Open API

Camel JBang allows to quickly expose an Open API service using _contract first_ approach,
where you have an existing OpenAPI specification file.

Then Camel JBang is able to bridge each API endpoints from the OpenAPI specification to
a Camel route with the naming convention `direct:<operationId>`.

This make it quick to implement a Camel route for a given operation.

See the https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/open-api[open-api example] for more details.

== Gathering list of dependencies

When working with Camel JBang then dependencies are automatically resolved. This means that
you do not have to use a build system like Maven or Gradle to add every Camel components
as a dependency.

However, you may want to know what dependencies are required to run the Camel integration.
To see this, you can use the `dependencies` command. The command output does not output a detailed
tree, such as `mvn dependencies:tree`, as the output is intended to list which Camel components,
and other JARs needed (when using Kamelets).

The dependency output by default is _vanilla_ Apache Camel with the camel-main as runtime, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel dependencies
org.apache.camel:camel-dsl-modeline:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-health:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-kamelet:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-log:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-rest:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-stream:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-timer:3.20.0
org.apache.camel:camel-yaml-dsl:3.20.0
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets-utils:0.9.3
org.apache.camel.kamelets:camel-kamelets:0.9.3
----

The output is by default a line per maven dependency in GAV format (_groupId:artifactId:version_).

You can also specify the output should be in _Maven format_ as shown:

[source,bash]
----

== Creating Projects

You can _export_ your Camel JBang integration to a traditional Java based project such as Spring Boot or Quarkus.

You may want to do this after you have built a prototype using Camel JBang, and are in need
of a traditional Java based project with more need for Java coding, or wanting to use the powerful
runtimes of Spring Boot, Quarkus or vanilla Camel Main.

=== Exporting to Camel Spring Boot

The command `export --runtime=spring-boot` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
Spring Boot project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Spring Boot using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

When exporting to Spring Boot then the Camel version defined in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` is
the same version as Camel JBang uses. However, you can specify the Camel version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject --camel-spring-boot-version=3.18.3
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

=== Exporting to Camel Quarkus

The command `export --runtime=quarkus` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
Quarkus project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Quarkus using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

=== Exporting to Camel Main

The command `export --runtime=camel-main` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
vanilla Camel Main project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Camel Main using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

=== Exporting as Gradle Project

Camel JBang exports by default as a Maven based project. To use Gradle instead, you can
specify the `--build-tool=gradle` when exporting, such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --build-tool=gradle --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../myproject
----

=== Exporting with JMX management included

Usually when exporting to Spring Boot, Quarkus or Camel Main, then JMX management is not included out of the box.
To include JMX, you need to add `camel:management` in the `--deps` option, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --deps=camel:management --directory=../myproject
----

=== Exporting with Camel CLI included

Usually when exporting to Spring Boot, Quarkus or Camel Main, then Camel JBang CLI is not included out of the box.
To be able to continue to use Camel CLI (i.e. `camel`), you need to add `camel:cli-connector` in the `--deps` option, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --deps=camel:cli-connector --directory=../myproject
----

=== Configuring exporting

The export command will by default load configuration from `application.properties`
which also can be used to specific parameters for export such as selecting the runtime and java version.

The follow options related to _exporting_, can be configured in `application.properties`:

|===
|Option | Description

|`camel.jbang.runtime`
|Runtime (spring-boot, quarkus, or camel-main)

|`camel.jbang.gav`
|The Maven group:artifact:version

|`camel.jbang.dependencies`
|Additional dependencies (Use commas to separate multiple dependencies). See more details at xref:_adding_custom_jars[].

|`camel.jbang.javaVersion`
|Java version (11 or 17)

|`camel.jbang.kameletsVersion`
|Apache Camel Kamelets version

|`camel.jbang.localKameletDir`
|Local directory for loading Kamelets

|`camel.jbang.camelSpringBootVersion`
|Camel version to use with Spring Boot

|`camel.jbang.springBootVersion`
|Spring Boot version

|`camel.jbang.quarkusGroupId`
|Quarkus Platform Maven groupId

|`camel.jbang.quarkusArtifactId`
|Quarkus Platform Maven artifactId

|`camel.jbang.quarkusVersion`
|Quarkus Platform version

|`camel.jbang.mavenWrapper`
|Include Maven Wrapper files in exported project

|`camel.jbang.gradleWrapper`
|Include Gradle Wrapper files in exported project

|`camel.jbang.buildTool`
|Build tool to use (maven or gradle)

|`camel.jbang.repos`
|Additional maven repositories for download on-demand (Use commas to separate multiple repositories)

|`camel.jbang.mavenSettings`
|Optional location of maven setting.xml file to configure servers, repositories, mirrors and proxies. If set to false, not even the default ~/.m2/settings.xml will be used.

|`camel.jbang.mavenSettingsSecurity`
|Optional location of maven settings-security.xml file to decrypt settings.xml

|`camel.jbang.exportDir`
|Directory where the project will be exported
|===

NOTE: These are options from the export command, so you can see mor details and default values using `camel export --help`.


== Troubleshooting

When using https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] then JBang stores state in `~/.jbang` directory.
This is also the location where JBang stores downloaded JARs.

Camel JBang also downloads needed dependencies while running. However, these dependencies
are downloaded to your local Maven repository `~/.m2`.

So if you find problems with running Camel JBang using what is seems like an outdated JAR, then you can
try to delete these directories, or parts of it.
