= Camel JBang

A JBang-based Camel app for easily running Camel routes.

== Installation

It is not necessary to install Camel JBang. However, if you prefer to do so, JBang makes it easy for us by providing an installation feature that works with GitHub. If you have JBang installed on your system, then you can run the following command to install Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

== Using Camel JBang

The Camel JBang supports multiple commands. Running the command below, will print all of them:

[source,bash]
----
jbang camel@apache/camel --help
----

TIP: The first time you run this command, it may cause dependencies to be cached, therefore taking a few extra seconds to run.

All the commands support the `--help` and will display the appropriate help if that flag is provided.


=== Using a specific Camel version

You can specify which Camel version to run as shown:

[source,bash]
----
jbang run -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.17.0 camel@apache/camel [command]
----

And you can also try bleeding edge development by using SNAPSHOT such as:

[source,bash]
----
jbang run -Dcamel.jbang.version=3.18.0-SNAPSHOT camel@apache/camel [command]
----

== Creating and running Camel routes

You can create a new basic routes with the `init` command.

For example to create an XML route you do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init cheese.xml
----

Which creates the file `cheese.xml` with a sample route.

To run the file, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run cheese.xml
----

NOTE: You can create and run any of the supported xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] in Camel such as YAML, XML, Java, Groovy.

To create a new .java integration, you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel init foo.java
----

=== Running Routes from multiple files

You can run more than 1 file, for example to run two YAML files you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml two.yaml
----

You can also mix different xref:dsl.adoc[DSLs] such as yaml and Java:

[source,bash]
----
camel run one.yaml hello.java
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the yaml files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *.yaml
----

Or you can run all files starting with foo*

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo*
----

TIP: The run goal can also detect files that are `properties`.

=== Dev mode with live reload

You can enable dev mode that comes with live reload of the route(s) when the source file is updated (saved),
using the `--dev` options as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel run jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml --dev
----

Then while the Camel application is running, you can update the YAML route and update when saving.

NOTE: The live reload is meant for development purposes, and if you encounter problems with reloading
such as JVM class loading issues, then you may need to restart the application.

=== Using profiles

Camel JBang have the concept of profiles. A _profile_ is essentially a name (id) that refers
to which configuration to automatic load with Camel JBang. The default profile is named `application`
which is a (smart default) to let Camel JBang automatic load `application.properties` (if present).

This means that creating profiles matching to a properties file with the same name.

For example having a profile named `local`, means that Camel JBang will load `local.properties` instead
of `application.properties`.

To use a profile, you specify as command line option `--profile` such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run hello.java --profile=local
----

You can only specify one profile name, i.e. `--profile=local,two` is not valid.

In the `properties` files you can configure all
the configurations from xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main].

For example to turn off xref:stream-caching.adoc[Stream Caching] and enable log masking you can specify:

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.streamCaching=false
camel.main.logMask=true
----

And you can also configure Camel components such as camel-kafka to declare the URL to the brokers:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.kafka.brokers=broker1:9092,broker2:9092,broker3:9092
----

NOTE: Keys starting with `camel.jbang` are reserved keys that are used by Camel JBang internally,
and as well allow for pre-configuring arguments for Camel JBang commands.

=== Downloading JARs over the internet

By default, Camel JBang will automatically resolve dependencies needed to run Camel, which is done
by JBang and Camel respectively. Camel itself detects at runtime if a component has a need for JARs that
are not currently available on the classpath, and can then automatic download the JARs (incl transitive).

Camel will download these JARs in the following order:

1. from local disk in `~/.m2/repository`
2. from internet in Maven Central
3. from internet in custom 3rd-party Maven repositories

If you do not want Camel JBang to download over the internet, you can turn this off with `--download`, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --download=false
----

=== Adding custom JARs

Camel JBang will automatically detect dependencies for Camel components, languages, data formats, etc. that
from its own release. This means you often do not have to specify which JARs to use.

However, if you need to add 3rd-party custom JARs then you can specify these with `--deps` as CLI argument in Maven
GAV syntax (`groupId:artifactId:version`), such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=com.foo:acme:1.0
----

In case you need to explicit add a Camel dependency you can use a shorthand syntax (starting with `camel:` or `camel-`)
such as:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=camel-saxon
----

You can specify multiple dependencies separated by comma:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --deps=camel-saxon,com.foo:acme:1.0
----

=== Using 3rd-party Maven repositories

Camel JBang will download from local repository first, and then online from Maven Central.
To be able to download from 3rd-party Maven repositories then you need to specify this as CLI argument,
]or in `application.properties`

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --repos=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

TIP: Multiple repositories can be separated by comma

The configuration for the 3rd-party Maven repositories can also be configured in `application.properties`
with the key `camel.jbang.repos` as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.jbang.repos=https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-external
----

And when running Camel then `application.properties` is automatically loaded:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java
----

However, you can also explicit specify the properties file to use:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java application.properties
----

And even better if you specify this as a profile:

[source,bash]
----
camel run foo.java --profile=application
----

Where the profile id is the name of the properties file.


=== Running routes hosted on GitHub

You can run a route that is hosted on GitHub using Camels xref:components:others:resourceresolver-github.adoc[github] resource loader.

For example to run one of the Camel K examples you can do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run github:apache:camel-k:examples/languages/routes.yaml
----

You can also use the `https` URL for GitHub. For example, you can browse the examples from a web-browser and
then copy the URL from the browser window and run the example with Camel JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-k/blob/main/examples/languages/routes.yaml
----

You can also use wildcards (i.e. `*`) to match multiple files, such as running all the groovy files:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-k/tree/main/examples/languages/*.groovy
----

Or you can run all files starting with rou*

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-k/tree/main/examples/languages/rou*
----

==== Running routes from GitHub gists

Using gists from GitHub is a quick way to share small Camel routes that you can easily run.

For example to run a gist you simply do:

[source,bash]
----
camel run https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

A gist can contain one or more files, and Camel JBang will gather all relevant files, so a gist
can contain multiple routes, properties files, Java beans, etc.

=== Downloading routes hosted on GitHub

We have made it easy for Camel JBang to download existing examples from GitHub to local disk,
which allows for modifying the example and to run locally.

All you need to do is to copy the https link from the web browser.
For example, you can download the _dependency injection_ example by:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/dependency-injection
----

Then the files (not sub folders) are downloaded to the current directory.
The example can then be run locally with:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

You can also run in dev mode, to hot-deploy on source code changes.

[source,bash]
----
camel run * --dev
----

You can also download a single file, such as one of the Camel K examples:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://github.com/apache/camel-k/blob/main/examples/languages/simple.groovy
----

This is a groovy route, which you can run with (or use `*`):

[source,bash]
----
camel run simple.groovy
----

==== Downloading routes form GitHub gists

You can also download files from gists easily as shown:

[source,bash]
----
camel init https://gist.github.com/davsclaus/477ddff5cdeb1ae03619aa544ce47e92
----

This will then download the files to local disk, which you can run afterwards:

[source,bash]
----
camel run *
----

=== Running Camel K integrations or bindings

Camel also supports running Camel K integrations and binding files, which are in CRD format (Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions).

For example a kamelet binding file named `joke.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
#!/usr/bin/env jbang camel@apache/camel run
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: joke
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: chuck-norris-source
    properties:
      period: 2000
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: log-sink
    properties:
      show-headers: false
----

Can be run with camel:

[source,bash]
----
camel run joke.yaml
----

=== Run from clipboard

You can also run Camel routes directly from the OS clipboard. This allows to copy some code,
and then quickly run this.

The syntax is

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.<extension>
----

Where `<extension>` is what kind of file the content of the clipboard is, such as `java`, `xml`, or `yaml` etc.

For example. you can copy this to your clipboard and then run it afterwards:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="timer:foo"/>
  <log message="Hello World"/>
</route>
----

[source,bash]
----
camel run clipboard.xml
----

=== Scripting from terminal using pipes

You can also execute a Camel JBang file as a script that can be used for terminal scripting with pipes and filters.

NOTE: Every time the script is executed a JVM is started with Camel. This is not very fast or low on memory usage,
so use Camel JBang terminal scripting where using Camel makes sense. For example to use the
many Camel components or Kamelets to more easily send or receive data from disparate IT systems.

This requires to add the following line in top of the file, for example as in the `upper.yaml` file below:

[source,text]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang --quiet camel@apache/camel pipe "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

# Will upper-case the input
- from:
    uri: "stream:in"
    steps:
      - setBody:
          simple: "${body.toUpperCase()}"
      - to: "stream:out"
----

To be able to execute this as a script, you need to set execute file permission:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x upper.yaml
----

Then you can then execute this as a script:

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./upper.yaml
----

Which should output:

[source,text]
----
HELLO
WORLD
----

Logging can be turned on using `--logging=true` which then logs to `.camel-jbang/camel-pipe.log` file.
The name of the logging file cannot be configured.

[source,bash]
----
echo "Hello\nWorld" | ./upper.yaml --logging=true
----

==== Using stream:in with line vs raw mode

When using `stream:in` to read data from _System in_ then the xref:components::stream-component.adoc[Stream component]
works in two modes:

- line mode (default) - reads input as single lines (separated by line breaks).
  Message body is a `String`.
- raw mode - reads the entire stream until _end of stream_.
  Message body is a `byte[]`.

IMPORTANT: The default mode is due to historically how the stream component was created.
Therefore, you may want to set `stream:in?readLine=false` to use raw mode.

=== Running local Kamelets

You can also use Camel JBang to try local Kamelets, without the need to publish them on GitHub or package them in a jar.

[source,bash]
----
camel run --local-kamelet-dir=/path/to/local/kamelets earthquake.yaml
----

=== Using platform-http component

When a route is started from `platform-http` then Camel JBang will automatically include a VertX HTTP server
running on port 8080. For example the following route in a file named `server.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "platform-http:/hello"
    steps:
      - set-body:
          constant: "Hello World"
----

Can be run with

[source,bash]
----
camel run server.yaml
----

And you can call the HTTP service with:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello World%
----

=== Using Java beans and processors

There is basic support for including regular Java source files together with Camel routes,
and let Camel JBang runtime compile the Java source. This means you can include smaller utility
classes, POJOs, Camel Processors and whatnot that the application needs.

NOTE: The Java source files cannot use package names. This may change in the future.

=== Dependency Injection in Java classes

When running Camel applications with camel-jbang, then the runtime is `camel-main` based. This means
there is no Spring Boot, or Quarkus available. However, we have added support for using annotation
based dependency injection in Java classes.

==== Using Camel dependency injection

You can use the following Camel annotations (they work on all runtimes):

- `@BindToRegistry` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@BeanInject` to dependency inject a bean on a class field.
- `@PropertyInject` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@BindToRegistry` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.
- `@Converter` on class level to auto-register the xref:type-converter.adoc[type converters] from the class.

==== Using Spring Boot dependency injection

You can use the following Spring Boot annotations:

- `@Component` or `@Service` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
- `@Autowired` to dependency inject a bean on a class field. `@Qualifier` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@Value` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@Bean` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method.

==== Using Quarkus injection

You can use the following Quarkus annotations:

- `@ApplicationScoped` or `@Singleton` on class level to create an instance of the class and register in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]. `@Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@Inject` to dependency inject an bean on a class field. `@Named` can be used to specify the bean id.
- `@ConfigProperty` to inject a xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholder]. Such as a property defined in `application.properties`.
- `@Produces` on a method to create a bean by invoking the method. `@Named` can be used to specify the bean id.

=== Debugging

==== Java debugging

You can debug both Camel JBang and your integration scripts by making use of the `--debug` flag provided by JBang:

[source,bash]
----
camel --debug run /path/to/integration.java
[jbang] Building jar...
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

As you can see the default listening port is 4004 but can be configured as described in https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/debugging.html[JBang Debugging].

This is a standard Java debug socket. You can then use the IDE of your choice. For instance, see the generic documentation for https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/attaching-to-local-process.html#create-rc[IntelliJ], https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging#_attach[VS Code] and https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html#remote-debugging[Eclipse Desktop]. You will surely want to add `Processor` to be able to put breakpoints hit during route execution (as opposed to route definition creation).

==== Camel debugging

The Camel debugger is available by default (the `camel-debug` component is automatically added to the classpath). By default, it can be reached through JMX at the URL `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/camel`.

You can then use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. For instance https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9371-apache-camel[IntelliJ], https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel[VS Code] or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textual-debugging-apache-camel[Eclipse Desktop].

A specific how-to is available for VS Code, see this https://youtu.be/owNhWxf42qk[video] or this /blog/2022/05/start-camel-quarkus-application-with-camel-textual-debug-in-vscode/[blogpost].

== Open API

Camel JBang allows to quickly expose an Open API service using _contract first_ approach,
where you have an existing OpenAPI specification file.

Then Camel JBang is able to bridge each API endpoints from the OpenAPI specification to
a Camel route with the naming convention `direct:<operationId>`.

This make it quick to implement a Camel route for a given operation.

See the https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets-examples/tree/main/jbang/open-api[open-api example] for more details.

== Creating Projects

You can _export_ your Camel JBang application to a traditional Java based project such as Spring Boot or Quarkus.

You may want to do this after you have built a prototype using Camel JBang, and are in need
of a traditional Java based project with more need for Java coding, or wanting to use the powerful
runtimes of Spring Boot, Quarkus or vanilla Camel Main.

=== Exporting to Camel Spring Boot

The command `export --runtime=spring-boot` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
Spring Boot project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Spring Boot using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=spring-boot --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --dir=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

=== Exporting to Camel Quarkus

The command `export --runtime=quarkus` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
Quarkus project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Quarkus using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --dir=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

=== Exporting to Camel Main

The command `export --runtime=camel-main` will export your current Camel JBang file(s) to a Maven based
vanilla Camel Main project with files organized in `src/main/` folder structure.

For example to export to Camel Main using the Maven groupId _com.foo_ and the artifactId _acme_
and with version _1.0-SNAPSHOT_ you simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

NOTE: This will export to the _current_ directory, meaning that files are moved into the needed folder structure.

To export to another directly (copies the files) you execute:

[source,bash]
----
camel export --runtime=camel-main --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --dir=../myproject
----

TIP: See the possible options by running: `camel export --help` for more details.

== Troubleshooting

When using https://www.jbang.dev/[JBang] then JBang stores state in `~/.jbang` directory.
This is also the location where JBang stores downloaded JARs.

Camel JBang also downloads needed dependencies while running. However, these dependencies
are downloaded to your local Maven repository `~/.m2`.

So if you find problems with running Camel JBang using what is seems like an outdated JAR, then you can
try to delete these directories, or parts of it.
