= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.10 to 3.11

=== camel-saxon

The camel-saxon component no longer depends on camel-xslt-saxon.
Any applications in needs of XSLT transformation with saxon should now declare an explicit dependency upon camel-xslt-saxon.
