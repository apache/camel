= Bean Injection

We support the injection of various resources using `@EndpointInject` or
`@BeanInject`. This can be used to inject

* xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] instances which can be used for testing
when used with xref:components::mock-component.adoc[Mock] endpoints; see the
xref:testing.adoc[Testing] for an example.
* xref:producertemplate.adoc[ProducerTemplate] instances for
xref:pojo-producing.adoc[POJO Producing]
* client side proxies for xref:pojo-producing.adoc[POJO Producing]

== Using @BeanInject

You can inject beans (obtained from the
xref:registry.adoc[Registry]) into your beans such as `RouteBuilder`
classes.

For example to inject a bean named foo, you can enlist the bean in the
xref:registry.adoc[Registry] such as in a Spring XML file:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="foo" class="com.foo.MyFooBean"/>
----

And then in a Java `RouteBuilder` class, you can inject the bean using
`@BeanInject` as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

   @BeanInject("foo")
   MyFooBean foo;

   public void configure() throws Exception {
     ..
   }
}
----

If you omit the name, then Camel does a lookup by type, and injects the
bean if there is exactly only one bean of that type enlisted in the
xref:registry.adoc[Registry].

[source,java]
----
   @BeanInject
   MyFooBean foo;
----

== Bean Injection with Quarkus

When using Camel with Spring Boot, or Quarkus, then the `@Inject`, or `@Named` annotations can
be used to inject Camel resources as well.

== Bean Injection with Spring Boot

Camel has first-class support for Spring Boot, and you can use the Spring annotations
such as `@Autowired` to also inject Camel resources.
