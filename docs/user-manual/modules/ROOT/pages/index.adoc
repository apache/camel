= Apache Camel user manual

Apache Camelâ„¢ is a versatile open-source integration framework based on
known xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

Camel empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of
domain-specific languages (xref:manual::dsl.adoc[DSL], such as Java, XML, Groovy, Kotlin, and YAML).
This means you get smart completion of
routing rules in your IDE, whether in a Java or XML editor.

For a deeper and better understanding of Apache Camel, an xref:faq:what-is-camel.adoc[Introduction] is provided.
