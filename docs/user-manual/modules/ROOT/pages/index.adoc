= Apache Camel user manual

Apache Camelâ„¢ is a versatile open-source integration framework based on
known xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

Camel empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of
domain-specific languages, including a Java-based xref:dsl.adoc[Fluent
API], xref:spring.adoc[Spring] or
xref:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.adoc[Blueprint]
xref:xml-configuration.adoc[XML Configuration] files.
This means you get smart completion of
routing rules in your IDE, whether in a Java or XML editor.

For a deeper and better understanding of Apache Camel, an xref:faq:what-is-camel.adoc[Introduction] is provided.
