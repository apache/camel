= camel:run

The *camel:run* goal of the xref:camel-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Maven
Plugin] is used to run your Camel xref:spring.adoc[Spring]
configurations in a forked JVM from Maven.

[source,shell]
----
cd examples/camel-example-spring
mvn camel:run
----

This makes it very easy to spin up and test your routing rules without
having to write a main(â€¦) method; it also lets you create multiple jars
to host different sets of routing rules and easily test them
independently.

How this works is that the plugin will compile the source code in the
maven project, then boot up a Spring ApplicationContext using the XML
configuration files on the classpath at

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
META-INF/spring/*.xml
----

== Running OSGi Blueprint

From *Camel 2.10* onwards the `camel:run` plugin also supports running a
xref:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.adoc[Blueprint] application, and by
default it scans for OSGi blueprint files in

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
OSGI-INF/blueprint/*.xml
----

You would need to configure the camel:run plugin to use blueprint, by
setting useBlueprint to true as shown below

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <useBlueprint>true</useBlueprint>
  </configuration>
</plugin>    
----

This allows you to boot up any Blueprint services you wish - whether
they are Camel-related, or any other Blueprint.

From *Camel 2.17* onwards the camel:run goal is able to auto detect if
camel-blueprint is on the classpath or there is blueprint XML files in
the project, and therefore you no longer have to configure the
useBlueprint option.

[NOTE]
====
 **Using limited Blueprint container**

We use the https://code.google.com/p/pojosr/[PojoSR project] as the
blueprint container. This project is not a full fledged blueprint
container. For that you can use http://karaf.apache.org/[Apache Karaf]
or http://servicemix.apache.org/[Apache ServiceMix].

In *Camel 2.15.3* and later, we use
https://github.com/apache/felix/tree/trunk/connect[Felix Connect]
instead. PojoSR https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-4445[was
donated] to ASF and is now maintained under Felix project.

====

You can use the `applicationContextUri` configuration to specify an
explicit blueprint XML file, such as:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <useBlueprint>true</useBlueprint>
    <applicationContextUri>myBlueprint.xml</applicationContextUri>
    <!-- ConfigAdmin options which have been added since Camel 2.12.0 -->
    <configAdminPid>test</configAdminPid>
    <configAdminFileName>/user/test/etc/test.cfg</configAdminFileName>
  </configuration>
</plugin>    
----

The `applicationContextUri` will currently load the file from the
classpath, so in the example above the myBlueprint.xml file must be in
the root of the classpath.
The `configAdminPid` is the pid name which will be used as the pid name
for configuration admin service when loading the persistence properties
file.
The `configAdminFileName` is the file name which will be used to load
the configuration admin service properties file.

== Running CDI

From *Camel 2.11* onwards the `camel:run` plugin also supports running a
xref:components:others:cdi.adoc[CDI] application

You would need to configure the camel:run plugin to use CDI, by setting
useCDI to true as shown below

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <useCDI>true</useCDI>
  </configuration>
</plugin>    
----

This allows you to boot up any CDI services you wish - whether they are
Camel-related, or any other CDI enabled services.

You should add the CDI container of your choice (e.g. Weld or
OpenWebBeans) to the dependencies of the camel-maven-plugin such as
https://github.com/apache/camel-examples/tree/master/examples/camel-example-cdi/[in
this example].

From *Camel 2.17* onwards the camel:run goal is able to auto detect if
camel-cdi in on the classpath, and therefore you no longer have to
configure the useCDI option.

From the source of Camel you can run a CDI example via

[source,shell]
----
cd examples/camel-example-cdi
mvn compile camel:run
----

== Logging the classpath

From *Camel 2.10* onwards you can configure whether the classpath should
be logged when `camel:run` executes. In older releases the classpath is
always logged.
This can be verbose and noisy, so from Camel 2.10 onwards, the classpath
is not logged anymore. You can enable this in the configuration using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <logClasspath>true</logClasspath>
  </configuration>
</plugin>    
----

== Using live reload of XML files

From *Camel 2.19* onwards you can configure the plugin to scan for XML
file changes and trigger a reload of the Camel routes which are
contained in those XML files.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <fileWatcherDirectory>src/main/resources/META-INF/spring</fileWatcherDirectory>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Then the plugin watches this directory. This allows you to edit the
source code from your editor and save the file, and have the running
Camel application pickup those changes.

Notice its only changes of Camel routes, eg `<routes>`, or
`<route>` which is supported. You cannot change Spring or OSGi Blueprint
`<bean>` elements.
