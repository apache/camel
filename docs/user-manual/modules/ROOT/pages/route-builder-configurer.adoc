[[RouteBuilderConfigurer-RouteBuilderConfigurer]]
= RouteBuilderConfigurer

The `RouteBuilderConfigurer` is a functional interface which is used for creating a routing rule using the DSL,
using Java lambda style.

[source,java]
----
rb -> rb.from("timer:foo").log("Hello Lambda");
----

Instances of RouteBuilderConfigurer are discovered and transformed into RouteBuilder instances
which are added to the CamelContext.

== Usage

To use `RouteBuilderConfigurer` you need to create a method that returns `RouteBuilderConfigurer` which then
allows to use Java lambda style to define a single route.

In the example below the method myRoute is used to create a Camel route that consume from Kafka and send the messages to JMS.

To make the route discoverable by Camel during startup, then the method must be annotated. In standalone mode with `camel-main`
you should use `@BindToRegistry` and with Spring Boot use `@Bean` and with Quarkus then use `@Produce`.

[source,java]
----
public class MyConfiguration {
    @BindToRegistry
    public RouteBuilderConfigurer myRoute() {
        return rb -> rb.from("kafka:cheese").to("jms:queue:foo");
    }
}
