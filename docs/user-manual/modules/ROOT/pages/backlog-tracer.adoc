= BacklogTracer

Camel supports a backlog tracer interceptor that is used for capturing a
trace message of each message as they are routed in Camel.
The trace message is stored in a backlog queue, which contains the last
N messages for each node in the routes (by default 10).

== What is the difference between BacklogTracer and Tracer

Camel also provides a xref:tracer.adoc[Tracer] which has similar
capabilities as this backlog tracer. The difference is that the backlog
tracer is storing a capture of the message in an internal backlog queue.

The xref:tracer.adoc[Tracer] is event based and logs the messages as they
happen (or route to another Camel destination).

Use the xref:tracer.adoc[Tracer] when all you need is to log the traced messages
as they happen.

The backlog tracer allows you to pull the messages from
the backlog queues on demand. The backlog tracer works better with JMX
capable tooling as it is simpler, allowing to bulk dump all its traced
messages in either a POJO or XML format.

== Options

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|===

|Option |Default |Description

|enabled |`false` |Flag to enable or disable this tracer

|backlogSize |`1000` |Maximum number of total traced messages to keep in the backlog (FIFO
queue).

|tracePattern |`null` |Allows to filter tracing using a pattern that matches against the node
id and route id. For example use `"to1,to2"` to match only nodes with
either the name "to1", or "to2". You can use * for wildcards. So you can
do "to*" to match any to. Or use "route-foo*" to match any foo routes.

|traceFilter |`null` |Allow to configure a filter as a xref:predicate.adoc[Predicate] using
any of the Camel xref:languages.adoc[languages]. But default the
xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language is used. For example to filter on
messages with a given header, use `${header.foo} != null`. To use
xref:components:languages:groovy-language.adoc[Groovy] then prefix the value with "groovy:". And
similar for the other languages.

|removeOnDump |`true` |Whether to remove the traced messages that was returned when invoking
the dump methods.

|bodyMaxChars |`128kb` |To limit the message body to a maximum size in the traced message. Use 0
or negative value to use unlimited size.

|bodyIncludeStreams |`false` |Whether to include the message body of stream based messages. If enabled
then beware the stream may not be re-readable later. See more about
xref:stream-caching.adoc[Stream Caching].

|bodyIncludeFiles |`true` |Whether to include the message body of file based messages. The overhead
is that the file content has to be read from the file.

|Option |Default |Description

|getTraceCounter |`long` |Gets the total number of traced messages.

|resetTraceCounter |`void` |To reset the trace counter.

|dumpTracedMessages(nodeOrRouteId) |`List<BacklogTracerEventMessage>` |To dump the traced messages from the give node or route id.

|dumpTracedMessagesAsXml(nodeOrRouteId) |`String` |To dump the traced messages from the give node or route id in XML
format.

|dumpAllTracedMessages |`List<BacklogTracerEventMessage>` |To dump all the traced messages

|dumpAllTracedMessagesAsXml |`String` |To dump all the traced messages in XML format.

== Enabling

You can turn off backlog tracing on `CamelContext`

[source,java]
----
camelContext.setBacklogTracing(true);
----

And in Spring XML

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext backlogTrace="true">
  ...
</camelContext>
----

And in Spring Boot you can enable this in the `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
camel.springboot.backlog-tracing = true
----
