= Camel Integration with Kubernetes

Please make sure to meet these prerequisites for running Camel integrations on Kubernetes:

* Connect to namespace on a Kubernetes cluster where you want to run the integration
* Camel K operator must be installed on the Kubernetes cluster (either installed on the same namespace or as global operator for the whole cluster)

Running Camel routes on Kubernetes is quite simple with Camel JBang.
In fact, you can develop and test your Camel route locally with Camel JBang and then promote the same source to running it as an integration on Kubernetes.

The Camel JBang Kubernetes functionality is provided as a command plugin.
This means you need to enable the `camel-k` plugin first to use the subcommands in Camel JBang.

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin add camel-k
----

You should see the `camel-k` plugin listed as installed plugin.

[source,bash]
----
camel plugin get
----

Now Camel JBang is able to run the subcommands offered by the plugin.
Simply run the integration using the `k` subcommand in Camel JBang.

[source,bash]
----
camel k run route.yaml
----

The command runs the Camel integration on Kubernetes.
More precisely it creates a Camel K Integration custom resource in the current namespace.
The Camel K operator makes sure to create a proper runtime image and run the integration (usually as a Pod).

The Camel K operator will automatically manage and configure this integration.
In particular the operator takes care on exposing services, configuring health endpoints, providing metrics, updating image streams and much more.

By default, the run command will not wait for the integration to in state running.
You need to add `-w` or `--wait` option in order to wait for the integration to become ready.

The `--logs` option makes the command also print the integration output once the integration Pod is running.

The run command offers a lot more options that you may use to configure the Camel K integration.

|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|--name
|The integration name. Use this when the name should not get derived from the source file name.

|--image
|An image built externally (for instance via CI/CD). Enabling it will skip the integration build phase.

|--kit, -k
|The kit used to run the integration.

|--profile
|The trait profile to use for the deployment.

|--service-account
|The service account used to run this Integration.

|--pod-template
|The path of the YAML file containing a PodSpec template to be used for the integration pods.

|--operator-id
|Operator id selected to manage this integration. (default=camel-k)

|--dependency, -d
|Adds dependency that should be included, use "camel:" prefix for a Camel component, "mvn:org.my:app:1.0" for a Maven dependency.

|--property, -p
|Add a runtime property or properties file from a path, a config map or a secret (syntax: [my-key=my-value,file:/path/to/my-conf.properties,[configmap,secret]:name]).

|--build-property
|Add a build time property or properties file from a path, a config map or a secret  (syntax: [my-key=my-value,file:/path/to/my-conf.properties,[configmap,secret]:name]]).

|--config
|Add a runtime configuration from a ConfigMap or a Secret (syntax: [configmap,secret]:name[/key], where name represents the configmap/secret name and key optionally represents the configmap/secret key to be filtered).

|--resource
|Add a runtime resource from a Configmap or a Secret (syntax: [configmap,secret]:name[/key][@path], where name represents the configmap/secret name, key optionally represents the configmap/secret key to be filtered and path represents the destination path).

|--open-api
|Add an OpenAPI spec (syntax: [configmap,file]:name).

|--env, -e
|Set an environment variable in the integration container, for instance "-e MY_VAR=my-value".

|--volume, -v
|Mount a volume into the integration container, for instance "-v pvcname:/container/path".

|--connect, -c
|A Service that the integration should bind to, specified as [[apigroup/]version:]kind:[namespace/]name.

|--source
|Add source file to your integration, this is added to the list of files listed as arguments of the command.

|--maven-repository
|Add a maven repository used to resolve dependencies.

|--annotation
|Add an annotation to the integration. Use name values pairs like "--annotation my.company=hello".

|--label
|Add a label to the integration. Use name values pairs like "--label my.company=hello".

|--traits, -t
|Add a label to the integration. Use name values pairs like "--label my.company=hello".

|--use-flows
|Write yaml sources as Flow objects in the integration custom resource (default=true).

|--compression
|Enable storage of sources and resources as a compressed binary blobs.

|--wait, -w
|Wait for the integration to become ready.

|--logs, -l
|Print logs after integration has been started.

|--output, -o
|Just output the generated integration custom resource (supports: yaml or json).
|=======================================================================

You can list the available integration resources with the following command.

[source,bash]
----
camel k get
NAME      PHASE    KIT            READY
my-route  Running  kit-123456789   1/1
----

This looks for all integrations in the current namespace and lists their individual status.

To inspect the log output of a running integration call:

[source,bash]
----
camel k logs my-route
----

The command connects to the running integration Pod and prints the log output.
Just terminate the process to stop printing the logs.

Of course, you may also delete an integration resource from the cluster.

[source,bash]
----
camel k delete my-route
----

To remove all available integrations on the current namespace use the `--all` option.

[source,bash]
----
camel k delete --all
----
