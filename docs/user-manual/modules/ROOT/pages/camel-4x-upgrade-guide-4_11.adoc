= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.10 to 4.11

=== EIPs

==== Recipient List, Split and Multicast EIP

In parallel processing mode, you can also enable `synchronous=true` to force these EIPs to process
the sub-tasks using the upper bounds of the thread-pool. If using `synchronous=false` then Camel
will allow its reactive routing engine to use as many threads as possible, which may be available
due to sub-tasks using other thread-pools such as `CompletableFuture.runAsync` or others.

Setting `synchronous=true` is the same behaviour is in Camel 2 which did not have the reactive routing engine.

==== WireTap and OnCompletion EIP

When MDC is enabled, then the WireTap and OnCompletion (in parallel mode) will now propagate MDC
context when creating threads to process the exchanges. This makes these EIPs similar to how
other EIPs such as Multicast EIP already does this.

=== camel-api

Added `removeTraits` method to `org.apache.camel.Message`.

Added `bind` method that accepts `Supplier` for the bean and also accepts init and destroy methods,
to the `org.apache.camel.spi.Registry` interface.

=== camel-attachments

The attachments have been refactored to be stored internally as a _message trait_,
and the `org.apache.camel.attachment.AttachmentMessage` is only a facade to provide
end user access to the fine-grained Attachment APIs. The underlying message implementation
such as `DefaultMessage` in the `Exchange` is un-affected when converting from `Message` to `AttachmentMessage` via:

[source,java]
----
AttachmentMessage am = exchange.getMessage(AttachmentMessage.class);
am.addAttachment("message1.xml", new DataHandler(new FileDataSource(new File("src/test/data/message1.xml"))));
----

The class `org.apache.camel.attachment.AttachmentMap` has been removed.
Removed `getDelegateMessage` method from `org.apache.camel.attachment.AttachmentMessage`.

=== camel-bean

The header `Exchange.BEAN_METHOD_NAME` with constant value `CamelBeanMethodName` has been deprecated, and support for using this header has been removed.
Instead, you can specify the `method` option directly as shown, or using any other header of your choosing as follows.

[source,java]
----
    toD("bean:myBean?method=${header.myMethodName}");
----

=== camel-main

Remove the deprecated `camel.main.lightweight` option that was not in use.

=== file based components

The file based component such as `camel-file`, `camel-ftp`, `camel-smb`, and `camel-azure-files` has
been improved to allow optimized dynamic poll when using dynamic `fileName` header.

This change means that there is a new `DynamicPollingConsumer` API the consumer implements.
And as such some APIs inside these components has been changed.

This will only affect if you have built your own custom Camel component on top of `camel-file`.
And if so, your custom code may need to be changed slightly as well.

=== camel-ftp

The file name header `Exchange.FILE_NAME` now includes the relative path such as `subdir/hello.txt`
when using `recursive=true`, to be similar to how `camel-file` component behaves.

=== camel-as2

The `camel-as2` component has been made more tooling friendly to configure options.

The option `signedReceiptMicAlgorithms` is changed from a `String[]` to a single `String` using comma to separate algorithm names.

The option `ediMessageType` is changed from `ContentType` into two options as `String` fields.
This allows to define the content-type and charset separately and more user-friendly.

=== camel-kafka

The camel-kafka option `recordMetadata` has changed default from `true` to `false`.

=== camel-jbang

The option `lazy-bean` has changed to be default `true` when exporting to make the export
work in more situations out of the box.

From this version onward the `export` command add the `camel-observability-services` dependency (which includes telemetry, metrics, health and JMX management services out of the box).

The `--health` and `--metrics` flags of `run` command have been deprecated in favor of the newly `--observe` flag which add the `camel-observability-services` dependency (hence including telemetry, metrics, health and JMX management out of the box). For the run command, this has to be explicitly enabled (ie, `camel run  ... --observe`).

=== camel-sql

When inserting or updating many rows in `batch=true` mode (producer) then this component
has been optimized to execute the entire batch operation in a single transaction; by turning off auto-commit
on the SQL Connection, and doing a manual `commit` or `rollback`. This can dramatically improve performance
on some databases. The old behaviour can be restored by setting the `batchAutoCommitDisabled=false` on the component or endpoint.

=== camel-etcd3

This deprecated component was removed in this release.

=== camel-platform-http

The `org.apache.camel.component.platform.http.PlatformHttpHeaderFilterStrategy` class has been removed. Use the `org.apache.camel.http.base.HttpHeaderFilterStrategy`

=== camel-undertow

The `org.apache.camel.component.undertow.UndertowHeaderFilterStrategy` class has been deprecated. The default header filter strategy is now the `org.apache.camel.http.base.HttpHeaderFilterStrategy`

=== camel-metrics

A new gauge metric, `app.info` is available by default. This is providing a few information related to the runtime provider such as:

```
# HELP app_info
# TYPE app_info gauge
app_info{camel_context="camel-1",camel_runtime_provider="Spring-Boot",camel_runtime_version="3.4.3",camel_version="4.10.2"} 1
```

This information is evaluated at runtime startup and available through the usual metrics endpoint. To disable this metric you need to use the `camel.metrics.skipCamelInfo=true` property.

=== camel-observability-services

In this version we're moving the telemetry component from `camel-opentelemetry` to `camel-opentelemetry2`.
