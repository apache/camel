= Test Infrastructure

The components in the Camel Test Infra provide utilities to simplify testing with Camel and other systems may interact with it.

The test infra is divided in two parts:

* One that offers container provisioning features for all scopes
* Another that provides container provisioning features for tests.

== Simulating the Test Infrastructure

One of the first steps when implementing a new test is to identify how to simulate infrastructure required for it to
run. The test-infra module provides a reusable library of infrastructure that can be used for that purpose. 

In general, the integration test leverages the features provided by the project https://www.testcontainers.org/[TestContainers]
and uses container images to simulate the environments. Additionally, it may also support running the tests against remote 
environments as well as, when available, embeddable components. This varies by each component, and it is recommended to 
check the code for additional details.

=== Writing A New Test Infrastructure Module


[NOTE]
====
This section is aimed at Camel maintainers that need to write new test infra components. End users can skip this section.
====

The test code abstracts the provisioning of test environments behind service classes (i.e.: JMSService, JDBCService,
etc). The purpose of the service class is to abstract both the type service (i.e.: Kafka, Strimzi, etc.) and
the location of the service (i.e.: remote, local, embedded, etc). This provides flexibility to test the code under 
different circumstances (i.e.: using a remote JMS broker or using a local JMS broker running in a container managed by
TestContainers). It makes it easier to hit edge cases as well as try different operating scenarios (i.e.: higher
latency, slow backends, etc).

When a container image is not available via TestContainers, tests can provide their own implementation using officially
available images. The license must be compatible with Apache 2.0. If an official image is not available, a Dockerfile
to build the service can be provided. The Dockerfile should try to minimize the container size and resource usage
whenever possible.

The container information must reside in a file named `container.properties` which should contain the container fully qualified
name:

[source,properties]
----
opensearch.container=mirror.gcr.io/opensearchproject/opensearch:2.18.0
opensearch.container.ppc64le=icr.io/ppc64le-oss/opensearch-ppc64le:2.12.0
----

The keys must follow the pattern `<name>.properties`. Specific architectures can be added to the key to denote which container
to be used for each architecture. Currently accepted values are:

* `aarch64`: for Arm
* `s390x`: for s390x (Linux On Mainframe)
* `ppc64le`: for 64-bit little ending power

It is also possible to use embeddable components when required, although this usually leads to more code and higher
maintenance.

NOTE: support for embeddable components may be removed in future versions.

==== Recommended Structure for Test Infrastructure Modules

The actual Service interface and implementation should be added under `src/main`, while the actual integration with JUnit 
can be added to `src/test`, in this way the classes needed to run the service (most of them, with testcontainers) are decoupled
by JUnit and can be run separately.

===== Main Sources

The service should provide an interface, named after the infrastructure being implemented, and this interface should extend the 
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/test-infra/camel-test-infra-common/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/test/infra/common/services/InfrastructureService.java[`InfrastructureService`]
interface.

Ideally, there should be two concrete implementations of the services: one of the remote service (if applicable) and
another for the container service: 

```
              MyService
                 / \
                /   \
               /     \
 MyRemoteService    MyContainerService
```
                     

In most cases, a specialized service factory class is responsible for creating the service according to runtime
parameters and/or other test scenarios constraints. When a service allows different service types or locations to be
selected, this should be done via command line properties (`-D<property.name>=<value>`). For example, when allowing a
service to choose between running as a local container or as remote instance, a property in the format
`<name>.instance.type` should be handled. Additional runtime parameters used in different scenarios, should be handled
as `<name>.<parameter>`. More complex services may use the builder available through the factory classes to compose 
the service accordingly.

===== Test Sources

Once the main sources are implemented, https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/test-infra/camel-test-infra-common/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/test/infra/common/services/TestService.java[TestService]
interface can be used to integrate the actual Service implementation with JUnit and its lifecycle.
The services should try to minimize the test execution time and resource usage when running. As such,
the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.1.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/BeforeAllCallback.html[BeforeAllCallback]
and https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.1.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/AfterAllCallback.html[AfterAllCallback]
should be the preferred extensions whenever possible because they allow the instance of the infrastructure to be static
throughout the test execution.

[NOTE]
====
Bear in mind that, according to the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.1.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/RegisterExtension.html[JUnit 5 extension]
model, the time of service initialization may differ depending on whether the service instance is declared as
static or not in the test class. As such, the code should make no assumptions as to its time of initialization.
====

==== Registering Properties

All services should register the properties, via `System.setProperty` that allow access to the services. This is required
 to resolve those properties when running tests using the Spring framework. This registration allows the properties
to be resolved in Spring's XML files. 

This registration is done in the `registerProperties` methods during the service initialization. 

==== Registering Properties Example:

Registering the properties in the concrete service implementation:

[source,java]
----
    public void registerProperties() {
        // MyServiceProperties.MY_SERVICE_HOST is a string with value "my.service.host"
        System.setProperty(MyServiceProperties.MY_SERVICE_HOST, container.getHost());
        
        // MyServiceProperties.MY_SERVICE_PORT is a string with value "my.service.port"
        System.setProperty(MyServiceProperties.MY_SERVICE_PORT, String.valueOf(container.getServicePort()));
        
        // MyServiceProperties.MY_SERVICE_ADDRESS is a string with value "my.service.address"
        System.setProperty(MyServiceProperties.MY_SERVICE_ADDRESS, getServiceAddress());
    }
    
    public void initialize() {
        LOG.info("Trying to start the MyService container");
        container.start();

        registerProperties();
        LOG.info("MyService instance running at {}", getServiceAddress());
    }
----

Then, when referring these properties in Camel routes or Spring XML properties, you may use `{{my.service.host}}`,
`{{my.service.port}}` and `{{my.service.address}}`.


==== Packaging Recommendations

This is infrastructure code for testing, therefore, it should be package as test type artifacts. The
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/main/test-infra/camel-test-infra-parent[parent pom] should provide all the necessary bits for packaging the test infrastructure.

=== Using The Test Infrastructure in Tests

Using the test infra in a new component test is rather straightforward, similar to using any other reusable component.
You start by declaring the test infra dependencies in your pom file. 

This should be similar to:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- test infra -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-test-infra-myservice</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <type>test-jar</type>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
On the dependencies above, the dependency version is set to `${project.version}`. This should be adjusted to the
Camel version when used outside the Camel Core project.
====

On the test class, add a member variable for the service and annotate it with the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.1.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/RegisterExtension.html[@RegisterExtension],
 to let JUnit 5 manage its lifecycle.

[source,java]
----
@RegisterExtension
static MyService service = MyServiceServiceFactory.createService();
----

More complex test services can be created using something similar to:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterExtension
static MyService service = MyServiceServiceFactory
    .builder()
        .addRemoveMapping(MyTestClass::myCustomRemoteService) // this is rarely necessary
        .addLocalMapping(MyTestClass::staticMethodReturningAService) // sets the handler for -Dmy-service.instance.type=local-myservice-local-container
        .addMapping("local-alternative-service", MyTestClass::anotherMethodReturningAService) // sets the handler for -Dmy-service.instance.type=local-alternative-service
    .createService();
----

You can use the methods as well as the registered properties to access the test infrastructure services available. 
When using these properties in Spring XML files, you may use those properties.

[source,xml]
----
<someSpringXmlElement httpHost="{{my.service.host}}" port="{{my.service.port}}" />
----

It's also possible to use these properties in the test code itself. For example, when setting up the test url for the
Camel component:

[source,java]
----
    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            public void configure() {
                from("direct:put")
                    .to("mycomponent:someoption?host={{my.service.host}}&port={{my.service.port}}");
            }
        };
    }
----

==== Execution Ordering

When combining the different modules of the test infra, you may need to ensure that they execute in the proper order. You can do so by using JUnit's `@Order` annotation.

For instance:

[source,java]
----
    @Order(1)
    @RegisterExtension
    protected static KafkaService service = KafkaServiceFactory.createSingletonService();

    @Order(2)
    @RegisterExtension
    protected static CamelContextExtension contextExtension = new DefaultCamelContextExtension();
----

== Container Runtime Support

Most of the test infrastructure in this module is based on containers.
Therefore, they will require a container runtime to run.
The tests have been written and tested using:

* Docker
* https://podman.io/[Podman]

=== Podman Support

Assuming Podman is properly installed and configured to behave like docker (i.e.: short name resolution, resolving docker.io registry, etc.), the only requirement for using Podman is to export the `DOCKER_HOST` variable before running the tests.

==== Linux

On most systems that should be similar to the following command: 

```
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$UID/podman/podman.sock
```

==== OS X and Windows

Running the test-infra with Podman on OS X and Windows should work on many cases. However, it requires additional steps and has a few issues. Therefore, it is not recommended at this time.

== Known Issues and/or Tips

=== Multi-architecture support

Some containers don't have images available for all architectures. In this case, it is recommended to:

1. use an alternative image from a reputable source if they provide an image for that architecture.
2. create a `Dockerfile` and build your own if the system is available on that arch.
3. disable the tests on that architecture.
