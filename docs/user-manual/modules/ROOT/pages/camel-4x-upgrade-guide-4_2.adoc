= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

The consumer will now pre validate hostname:port and DNS resolution on startup, and fail-fast
in case of mis-configuration or invalid hostname.

This can be disabled by setting `preValidateHostAndPort=false`, which will postpone validation
to consumer is started, and will instead re-connect endlessly (5 sec delay by default) until success.
