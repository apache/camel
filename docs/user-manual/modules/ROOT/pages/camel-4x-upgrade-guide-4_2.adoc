= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.1 to 4.2

=== camel-file

The `readLock=changed` with using `readLockMinAge` has been restored to same behaviour as 3.x.

For example using `readLockMinAge=5s` would pickup files that are older than 5 seconds from startup time.
If you have many existing files on startup that are old, then Camel will now again be fast,
and pickup these files immediately.

=== camel-kafka

The consumer will now pre validate hostname:port and DNS resolution on startup, and fail-fast
in case of mis-configuration or invalid hostname.

This can be disabled by setting `preValidateHostAndPort=false`, which will postpone validation
to consumer is started, and will instead re-connect endlessly (5 sec delay by default) until success.

=== camel-saga, camel-lra

The `org.apache.camel.service.lra.LRAClient` can now access `Exchange` to retrieve further context information. Therefore, there are following changes in interface methods
- `org.apache.camel.saga.CamelSagaService.compensate()` changed to `org.apache.camel.saga.CamelSagaService.compensate(Exchange exchange)`
- `org.apache.camel.saga.CamelSagaService.complete()` changed to `org.apache.camel.saga.CamelSagaService.complete(Exchange exchange)`
- `org.apache.camel.saga.CamelSagaCoordinator.newSaga` is now `org.apache.camel.saga.CamelSagaCoordinator.newSaga(Exchange exchange)`
to support the transport of `Exchange`.

As result of interface changes also the known implementation classes and usages have been adopted.

=== camel-ignite

The Apache Ignite project (v2.15) is not yet Java 21 compatible and therefore `camel-ignite` is not
expected to function correctly if using Java 21.

A new release of Apache Ignite is expected that will start to support Java 21.
