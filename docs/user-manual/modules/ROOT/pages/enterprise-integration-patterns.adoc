Enterprise Integration Patterns

Camel supports most of the

from the excellent book by
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/105-9796798-8100401?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Gregor%20Hohpe[Gregor

Woolf].

If you are new to Camel you might want to try the
Getting Started in the
User Guide before attempting to implement these
patterns.

The EIP icons library is available as a Visio stencil file adapted to
render the icons with the Camel color : sand. Download it

for your presentation, functional and technical analysis documents. The
original EIP stencil is also available in
