[[Templating-Templating]]
= Templating

When you are testing distributed systems its a very common requirement
to have to stub out certain external systems with some stub so that you
can test other parts of the system until a specific system is available
or written etc.

A great way to do this is using some kind of Template system to generate
responses to requests generating a dynamic message using a mostly-static
body.

There are a number of templating components included in the Camel
distribution you could use

* xref:components::freemarker-component.adoc[FreeMarker]
* xref:components::mustache-component.adoc[Mustache]
* xref:components::string-template-component.adoc[StringTemplate]
* xref:components::velocity-component.adoc[Velocity]
* xref:components::xquery-component.adoc[XQuery]
* xref:components::xslt-component.adoc[XSLT]

or the following external Camel components

[[Templating-Example]]
== Example

Here's a simple example showing how we can respond to InOut requests on
the *My.Queue* queue on xref:components::activemq-component.adoc[ActiveMQ] with a template
generated response. The reply would be sent back to the JMSReplyTo
Destination.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("velocity:com/acme/MyResponse.vm");
----

If you want to use InOnly and consume the message and send it to another
destination you could use

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
from("activemq:My.Queue").
  to("velocity:com/acme/MyResponse.vm").
  to("activemq:Another.Queue");
----
