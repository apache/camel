Camel supports a pluggable
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/core/camel-api/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/spi/Registry.java[Registry]
plugin strategy. This allows Camel to easily work with some kind of
registry like

* https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/core/camel-support/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/support/SimpleRegistry.java[SimpleRegistry]
which is a simple `java.util.Map` based registry.
* https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/core/camel-core-engine/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/JndiRegistry.java[JndiRegistry]
which uses the JNDI InitialContext as the registry

You can also access the Registry from the
CamelContext via the
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/core/camel-api/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.java#L690[camelContext.getRegistry()
method]
