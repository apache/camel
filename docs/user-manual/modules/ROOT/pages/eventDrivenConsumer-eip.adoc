== Event Driven Consumer

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/EventDrivenConsumer.html[Event Driven Consumer]
from the
xref:EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns-EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns.adoc[EIP patterns].
The default consumer model is event based (i.e. asynchronous)
as this means that the Camel container can then manage pooling,
threading and concurrency for you in a declarative manner.

The Event Driven Consumer is implemented by consumers implementing the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
interface which is invoked by the xref:messageEndpoint-eip.adoc[Message Endpoint]
when a xref:message-eip.adoc[Message] is available for processing.

[[eventDrivenConsumer-Example]]
=== Example

The following demonstrates a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
defined in the Camel xref:Registry-Registry.adoc[Registry] which is
invoked when an event occurs from a xref:jms-component.adoc[JMS] queue.

*Using the xref:FluentBuilders-FluentBuilders.adoc[Fluent Builders]*

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:foo")
    .processRef("processor");
----

**Using the xref:SpringXMLExtensions-SpringXMLExtensions.adoc[Spring XML Extensions]**

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
    <to uri="processor"/>
</route>
----

[[eventDrivenConsumer-UsingThisPattern]]
=== Using This Pattern

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
xref:GettingStarted-GettingStarted.adoc[Getting Started], you may also find the
xref:Architecture-Architecture.adoc[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of xref:Endpoint-Endpoints.adoc[Endpoint] and xref:URIs-URIs.adoc[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the xref:Examples-Examples.adoc[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
