= Configuring Routes Startup Ordering and Autostartup

Camel supports configuring two aspects:

* auto startup
* order of starting routes

== Autostartup

The `autoStartup` option allows is to configure
Camel to *not* auto start routes when Camel starts.

The auto startup can be configured on two levels:

- CamelContext - _Globally_
- Route - _Individually per route_

For example the xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] below we have configured `autoStartup=false` to
prevent Camel starting all the routes on startup.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="myCamel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"
              autoStartup="false">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:foo"/>
    </route>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:bar"/>
        <to uri="mock:bar"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

So how do you start the routes?

The `autoStartup` option on the `<camelContext>` is only used once, so you
can manually start Camel later by invoking its `start` method in Java as shown
below.

For example when using Spring, you can get hold of the `CamelContext` via
the Spring `ApplicationContext`:

[source,java]
----
ApplicationContext ac = ...
CamelContext camel = ac.getBean("myCamel", CamelContext.class);

// now start all the routes
camel.getRouteController().startAllRoutes();
----

TIP: The routes can also be started via JMX (requires `camel-management` JAR to be on the classpath) by invoking the `startAllRoutes` operation on the CamelContext MBean.

=== Autostartup per route level

You can also use the `autoStartup` option to configure if a given route
should be started when Camel starts. By default, a route is auto started.

In XML DSL you disable auto startup as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<route autoStartup="false">
   <from uri="activemq:queue:special"/>
   <to uri="file://backup"/>
</route>
----

And to explicit state it should be started:

[source,xml]
----
<route autoStartup="true">
   <from uri="activemq:queue:special"/>
   <to uri="file://backup"/>
</route>
----

And in Java DSL you can configure auto startup on `CamelContext` as follows:

[source,java]
----
camelContext.setAutoStartup(false);
----

And on route level you can disable it via `noAutoStartup`:

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:queue:special").noAutoStartup()
    .to("file://backup");
----

To startup based on a boolean, String or
xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Property], do one of the following:

[source,java]
----
// using a boolean
from("activemq:queue:special").autoStartup(false)
    .to("file://backup");

// using a string
from("activemq:queue:special").autoStartup("false")
    .to("file://backup");

// using property placeholders
from("activemq:queue:special").autoStartup("{{startupRouteProperty}}")
    .to("file://backup");
----

== Configuring starting order for routes

You can also configure the order in which routes are started. Previously
Camel started the routes in a non-deterministic order. Now you have
fine-grained control in which order the routes should be started. There is a
new attribute `startupOrder` which is an `Integer` that states the order.
Camel then sorts the routes before starting time. The routes with the
lowest `startupOrder` are started first and the ones with the highest are
started last.

IMPORTANT: All `startupOrder` defined must be unique among all routes in your
xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext]. Otherwise, if there are clashes in
`startupOrder` numbers among routes, the routes will fail to start up throwing
`org.apache.camel.FailedToStartRouteException`.

Normally you should also use numbers that are lower than 1000, as routes without
an explicit `startupOrder` definition will have a number starting from 1000
auto assigned. So view numbers from 1000 upwards as reserved internally
for Camel itself.

However, you can also utilise much higher numbers than 1000
(to avoid collisions with those auto assigned numbers) to specify the last routes
to start up. Normally the usage of numbers starting from 10000 should be safe
for the purpose.

In terms of the `startupOrder` there are no strict rules that it must
start from 1 and increment by 1. You can for example use: 100, 200, 205,
89 if you like. Only rule of thumb is that the numbers must be unique.

=== Why do you want to control the starting order?

It can help in cases where routes are inter-dependent on each other and
also help with graceful shutting down Camel as Camel can stop the routes
in the correct order as well.

Camel will stop the routes in the *reverse* order that they were started.

Let's try a couple of examples.

=== Startup ordering example

[source,java]
----
from("seda:foo").startupOrder(1)
    .to("mock:result");

from("direct:start").startupOrder(2)
    .to("seda:foo");
----

And the same example with XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route startupOrder="1">
        <from uri="seda:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

    <route startupOrder="2">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="seda:foo"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

In this example we have two routes in which we have started that the
direct:start route should be started *after* the seda:foo route.
Because direct:start is considered the input, and we want seda:foo
route to be up and running beforehand.

=== Using startOrder together with non startOrder

You can also mix and match routes with and without `startupOrder` defined.
The first two routes below have start order defined, and the last route has not.

[source,java]
----
from("seda:foo").startupOrder(1)
    .to("mock:result");

from("direct:start").startupOrder(2)
    .to("seda:foo");

from("direct:bar")
    .to("seda:bar");
----

And the same example with XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<routes>
    <route startupOrder="1">
        <from uri="seda:foo"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>

    <route startupOrder="2">
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="seda:foo"/>
    </route>

    <route>
        <from uri="direct:bar"/>
        <to uri="seda:bar"/>
    </route>
</routes>
----

In the route above we have *not* defined a `startupOrder` on the last
route direct:bar in which Camel will auto assign a number for it, in
which this case will be 1000; therefore the route will be started
last.

So you can use this to your advantage to only assign a `startupOrder` on
the routes which really needs it.

=== Configuring routes to start up last

You can use a high number in `startupOrder` to have a specific route startup last as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// use auto assigned startup ordering
from("direct:start").to("seda:foo");

// should start first
from("seda:foo").startupOrder(1).to("mock:result");

// should start last after the default routes
from("direct:bar").startupOrder(12345).to("seda:bar");

// use auto assigned startup ordering
from("seda:bar").to("mock:other");
----

In the example above the order of startups of routes should be:

1. seda:foo
2. direct:start
3. seda:bar
4. direct:bar

=== Shutting down routes

Camel will shut down the routes in the *reverse* order that they were started.
