= camel:embedded

The *camel:embedded* goal of the xref:camel-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel
Maven Plugin] is used to run your Camel xref:spring.adoc[Spring]
configurations in the same JVM as Maven, so it should startup a bit
faster than xref:camel-run-maven-goal.adoc[camel:run]. Though sometimes
we all get the odd classpath issue; so sometimes forking a new JVM can
work around any strange Maven classpath issues.
