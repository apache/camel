[[GettingStarted-GettingStarted]]
=== Getting Started

First you need to Download the Camel distribution;
or you could grab the Source and try
Building it yourself.

Then come back here and you might want to read the following
documentation before continuing:

* Longer Getting Started Guide
* Find out about link:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] and how to implement them with Camel
* Review the Architecture guide to see how to
build Routes using the Java DSL or
Spring based link:xml-configuration.adoc[Xml
Configuration]

[[GettingStarted-WorkingwithCamelContextsandRouteBuilders]]
==== Working with CamelContexts and RouteBuilders

To get started with Camel:

1.  Create a CamelContext.
2.  Optionally, link:configuring-camel.adoc[configure components or
endpoints].
3.  Add whatever routing rules you wish using the DSL and
RouteBuilder or using
XML Configuration.
4.  Start the context.

When your application is closing you may wish to
stop the context

When you are ready, why not link:walk-through-an-example.adoc[Walk
through an Example]? +
 And then continue the walk link:walk-through-another-example.html[Walk
through another example] +
 And after the walks head over to the tutorials.

[[GettingStarted-WorkingwithSpring]]
==== Working with Spring

If you use Spring as a Dependency Injection container then please refer
to the Camel Spring documentation.

the basic Camel concepts. This is a free chapter you can download
directly as a pdf (about 20 pages) and introduces you to Camel. We have
been told by experience Camel end users they wished this chapter was
available to them when they started learning Camel.

* http://java.dzone.com/articles/open-source-integration-apache[Open
Source Integration with Apache Camel and How Fuse IDE Can Help] by
Jonathan Anstey. Updated article of the

has a good use case example.

* Several of the vendors on the
Commercial Camel Offerings page

useful.
