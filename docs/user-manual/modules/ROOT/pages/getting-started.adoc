= Getting Started

First you need to Download the Camel distribution;
or you could grab the Source and try
Building it yourself.

Then come back here, and you might want to read the following
documentation before continuing:

* Longer xref:book-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started Guide]
* Find out about xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration Patterns]
  and how to implement them with Camel
* Review the xref:architecture.adoc[Architecture guide] to see how to build Routes using the xref:dsl.adoc[DSL].

== Working with CamelContexts and RouteBuilders

To get started with Camel:

1.  Create a xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext].
2.  Add whatever routing rules you wish using the DSL and `RouteBuilder` or using XML DSL.
3.  Start the Camel context.

When your application is closing you may wish to stop the context

When you are ready, why not xref:walk-through-an-example.adoc[Walk through an Example]?
And then continue the walk xref:walk-through-another-example.adoc[Walk through another example].
