[[GettingStarted-GettingStarted]]
= Getting Started

First you need to Download the Camel distribution;
or you could grab the Source and try
Building it yourself.

Then come back here and you might want to read the following
documentation before continuing:

* Longer xref:book-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started Guide]
* Find out about xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration Patterns]
  and how to implement them with Camel
* Review the xref:architecture.adoc[Architecture guide] to see how to build Routes using the xref:java-dsl.adoc[Java DSL]
  or xref:xml-configuration.adoc[XML DSL]

[[GettingStarted-WorkingwithCamelContextsandRouteBuilders]]
== Working with CamelContexts and RouteBuilders

To get started with Camel:

1.  Create a xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext].
2.  Optionally, xref:configuring-camel.adoc[configure components or endpoints].
3.  Add whatever routing rules you wish using the DSL and `RouteBuilder` or using XML DSL.
4.  Start the Camel context.

When your application is closing you may wish to stop the context

When you are ready, why not xref:walk-through-an-example.adoc[Walk through an Example]?
And then continue the walk xref:walk-through-another-example.adoc[Walk through another example].

the basic Camel concepts. This is a free chapter you can download
directly as a pdf (about 20 pages) and introduces you to Camel. We have
been told by experience Camel end users they wished this chapter was
available to them when they started learning Camel.

Source Integration with Apache Camel and How Fuse IDE Can Help] by
Jonathan Anstey. Updated article of the

has a good use case example.

* Several of the vendors on the

useful.
