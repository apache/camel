= Components

Components are a fundamental building block of Apache Camel and are used to connect routes to a wide variety of external systems and services. Camel comes with a large number of built-in components that provide connectivity to a wide range of technologies and protocols, such as HTTP, JMS, file, and many others. You can also create a custom components if the built-in components do not meet your needs.

== Components: the basics

A Component is essentially a factory of Endpoint instances. Typically, applications shouldn't need to interact directly with a component. However, there are some circumstances where manipulating the component may be beneficial for the performance, operation, or scalability of the application. In such cases, these applications may use the context to get access to an instance of the endpoint they need to manipulate. The applications can do so by using the method `CamelContext.getEndpoint()`. This method returns an implementation of the `Component` interface that is appropriate for the component requested. For instance, consider the following code:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3://john.smith@mailserv.example.com?password=myPassword");
----

For the URI given in the above example, the `CamelContext` object would map the `pop3` prefix to an instance of the `MailComponent` class.

The parameter to `getEndpoint()` is a URI. The URI _scheme_ (that is,
the part before `:`) specifies the name of a component. Internally, the `CamelContext` object maintains a mapping from the names of components to `Component` objects.

== Configuring Component Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

- component level
- endpoint level

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints.
For example, a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre-configured defaults
that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL], in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

== Configuring Endpoint Options

Typically, you want to configure endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to configure what you need the endpoint to do. These endpoint options are also categorized according to the type of endpoint:

* consumer (_from_)
* producer (_to_)
* or both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use
the xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL] as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints.

A good practice when configuring options is to use xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Property Placeholders],
which allow us to avoid using hardcoded urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings.
In other words, with placeholders you can externalize the configuration from your code, thus obtaining more flexibility and reuse.

=== How Camel maps names to components

In the getting started guide, we explained that Camel maintains a map of names to components. This raises the question of how Camel populates this map with named `Component` objects.

[NOTE]
====
Normally, application developers don't need to worry about this. However, this information is fundamental if you are writing a custom component.
====

There are two ways of populating the map.

* Programmatically, using the context
* Via lazy-initialization

=== Programmatically

The programmatic way is for application-level code to invoke `CamelContext.addComponent(String componentName, Component component)`.

The example below shows a single `MailComponent` object being registered in the map under 3 different names.

[source,java]
----
Component mailComponent = new org.apache.camel.component.mail.MailComponent();
myCamelContext.addComponent("pop3", mailComponent);
myCamelContext.addComponent("imap", mailComponent);
myCamelContext.addComponent("smtp", mailComponent);
----

=== Lazy-initialization

The second (and preferred) way to populate the map of named `Component` objects in the `CamelContext` object is to let the `CamelContext` object perform lazy initialization.

This approach relies on developers following a convention when they write a class that implements the `Component` interface. For instance, let's assume you write a class called `com.example.myproject.FooComponent` and you want Camel to automatically recognize this by the name `foo`. To do this, you write a properties file called `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo` (without a `.properties` file extension) that has a single entry in it called `class`, the value of which is the fully-scoped name of your class. For instance:

.META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo
[source]
----
class=com.example.myproject.FooComponent
----

If you want Camel to also recognize the class by the name `bar` then you write another properties file in the same directory called `bar` that has the same contents. Once you have written the properties file(s), you create a JAR file that contains the `com.example.myproject.FooComponent` class and the properties file(s), and you add this jar file to your CLASSPATH. Then, when application-level code invokes `createEndpoint("foo:...")` on a `CamelContext` object, Camel will find the "foo"" properties file on the CLASSPATH, get the value of the `class` property from that properties file, and use reflection APIs to create an instance of the specified class.

Camel provides out-of-the-box support for various communication technologies. This support consists of classes that implement the `Component` interface plus properties files that enable a `CamelContext` object to populate its map of named `Component`
objects.

Earlier in this guide, we provided the following example of calling `CamelContext.getEndpoint()`:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3://john.smith@mailserv.example.com?password=myPassword");
----

We originally referred to the parameter as a URI because the online Camel documentation and the Camel source code both claim the parameter is a URI. In reality, the parameter is restricted to being a URL. This is because when Camel extracts the component name from the parameter, it looks for the first ":", which is a simplistic algorithm.

[NOTE]
====
Remember that in the xref:camel-core:getting-started:index.adoc[Getting Started With Camel] we explained that a URI could be a URL or a URN.
====

Now consider the following calls to `getEndpoint`:

[source,java]
----
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("pop3:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("jms:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("urn:foo:...");
myCamelContext.getEndpoint("urn:bar:...");
----

Camel identifies the components in the above example as `pop3`, `jms`, `urn`, and `urn`. It would be more useful if the latter components were identified as `urn:foo` and `urn:bar` or as `foo` and `bar` (that is, by skipping over the `urn:` prefix). So, in practice, you must identify an endpoint with a URL (a string of the form `<scheme>:...`) rather than with a URN (a string of the form `urn:<scheme>:...`). This lack of proper support for URNs means that you should consider the parameter to the method `getEndpoint()` as being a URL rather than (as claimed) a URI.

[NOTE]

Make sure to read xref:faq:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints?]
to learn more about configuring endpoints. For example, how to refer to beans in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] or how
to use raw values for password options, and using xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders] etc.

== Component DSL

Component-DSL is a builder API that allows using type-safe construction of Camel Components and injecting them directly to the xref:camelcontext.adoc[Camel Context] instead of initializing through a constructor.
