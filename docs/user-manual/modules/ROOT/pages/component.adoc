A Component is essentially a factory of xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] instances.

You can explicitly configure Component instances
and add them to a xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] in an IoC
container like Spring, or they can be auto-discovered using
xref:uris.adoc[URIs].

[[Component-ComponentsIncluded]]

Camel includes the following Component implementations via xref:uris.adoc[URIs].

====
Make sure to read xref:faq/how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints?]
to learn more about configuring endpoints. For
example how to refer to beans in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] or how
to use raw values for password options, and using
xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders] etc.
