= How do I run ActiveMQ and Camel in JBoss?

A user had a problem with running ActiveMQ embedded inside JBoss. He
reported his findings on the Camel mailing list which you can read about
http://www.nabble.com/JBoss-%2B-ActiveMQ-%2B-Camel-%2B-Newbie-td24056976.html[his
solution here].

== Using Camel in JBoss

*Since Camel 2.1*

We have now created a https://github.com/camel-extra/camel-extra/blob/master/components/camel-jboss/src/main/docs/jboss-component.adoc[camel-jboss] component which
allows you to run Camel inside JBoss. Unfortunately JBoss uses LGPL
license which is Apache unfriendly so the project is hosted at
https://camel-extra.github.io/[Camel Extra].

Basically what you need is to use a specialized classloader due to JBoss
classloading challenges. This classloder is provided in the
https://github.com/camel-extra/camel-extra/blob/master/components/camel-jboss/src/main/docs/jboss-component.adoc[camel-jboss] component.
