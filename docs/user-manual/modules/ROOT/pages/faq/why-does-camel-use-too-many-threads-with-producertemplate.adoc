= Why does Camel use too many threads with `ProducerTemplate`?

A common reason is creating a new `ProducerTemplate` inside a `Processor` or
xref:bean-integration.adoc[bean method invocation].

You are not meant to create a `ProducerTemplate` for each message
invocation; you are meant to create a single instance on startup and
keep it around.

Also when you have finished using the `ProducerTemplate` you should call
the `stop()` method to close down all the resources it has been using.

It's better to either explicitly create one on startup or get your IoC
container (xref:components::spring.adoc[Spring]) to inject
it into your `Processor` or bean then it can take care of creating it and
destroying all the resources when you have finished with it.

For instance using xref:components::spring.adoc[Spring] you can define a template
and have Spring handle the lifecycle of it:

[source,java]
----
    <camelContext xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
        <template id="template"/>
    </camelContext>
----

Then you can refer to the ProducerTemplate with the id `template`.
