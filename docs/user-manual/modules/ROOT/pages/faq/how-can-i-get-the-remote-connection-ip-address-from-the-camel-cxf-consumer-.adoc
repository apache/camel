= How can I get the remote connection IP address from the camel-cxf consumer ?

From *Camel 2.6.0*, you can access the CXF Message by using the key of
`CamelCxfMessage` from message header, and you can get the
`ServletRequest` instance from the CXF message, then you can get the
remote connection IP easily.

Here is the code snippet:

[source,java]
----
// check the remote IP from the CXF Message
org.apache.cxf.message.Message cxfMessage = exchange.getIn().getHeader(CxfConstants.CAMEL_CXF_MESSAGE, org.apache.cxf.message.Message.class);
ServletRequest request = (ServletRequest) cxfMessage.get("HTTP.REQUEST");
String remoteAddress = request.getRemoteAddr();
----
