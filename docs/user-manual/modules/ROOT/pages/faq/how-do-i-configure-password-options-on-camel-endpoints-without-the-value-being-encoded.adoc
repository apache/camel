= How do I configure password options on Camel endpoints without the value being encoded?

When you configure Camel endpoints using xref:uris.adoc[URIs] then the
parameter values gets url encoded by default. +
This can be a problem when you want to configure passwords _as is_.

To do that you can tell Camel to use the raw value, by enclosing the
value with RAW(value). See more details at
xref:faq/how-do-i-configure-endpoints.adoc[How do I configure endpoints?]
which has an example also.
