= What are the dependencies?

* Camel 2.6 or older can run on JDK 1.5 or better.
* Camel 2.7 onwards requires JDK 1.6 or JDK 1.7.
* Camel 2.14 onwards requires JDK 1.7 or better.
* Camel 2.18 onwards requires JDK 1.8.

== What are the runtime jar dependencies?

Apache Camel is designed to require a minimum number of dependencies for
us so it is ideal for embedding into smart clients, message brokers, SOA
frameworks and ESBs.

[[Whatarethedependencies-CamelJARDependencies]]
== Camel JAR Dependencies

Camel core itself is lightweight and can run with a few .jars.

[[Whatarethedependencies-camel-coredependenciesforCamel2.0orlower]]
=== `camel-core` dependencies for Camel 2.0 or lower

* `commons-logging-api.jar` -- API for commons logging
* JAXB 2.1.x -- XML stuff -- Is provided in the JDK core from Java 1.6
* `activation.jar` -- For Attachments support -- Is provided in the JDK
core from Java 1.6

[[Whatarethedependencies-camel-coredependenciesforCamel2.1-2.6]]
=== `camel-core` dependencies for Camel 2.1 - 2.6

* `commons-logging-api-1.1.jar` -- API for commons logging
* `commons-management-1.0.jar` -- API for JMX
* JAXB 2.1.x -- XML stuff -- Is provided in the JDK core from Java 1.6
* `activation-1.1.jar` -- For Attachments support -- Is provided in the
JDK core from Java 1.6

[[Whatarethedependencies-camel-coredependenciesforCamel2.7-2.8]]
=== `camel-core` dependencies for Camel 2.7 - 2.8

* `slf4j-api-1.5.11.jar` -- API for slf4j logging
* `commons-management-1.0.jar` -- API for JMX

[[Whatarethedependencies-camel-coredependenciesforCamel2.9]]
=== `camel-core` dependencies for Camel 2.9

* `slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar` -- API for slf4j logging

[[Whatarethedependencies-OptionalDependenciesforJMXforCamel1.x-2.8]]
=== Optional Dependencies for JMX for Camel 1.x - 2.8

* `spring-core.jar`, `spring-beans.jar`,
`spring-context.jar`, `spring-aop.jar` -- All 4 jars needed to use JMX
with Camel (subject to change in the future).

From *Camel 2.9*: the Spring JARs are no longer required for using JMX.

[[Whatarethedependencies-OtherComponents]]
== Other Components

All the other xref:component.adoc[Components] have a range of 3rd party
.jars they depend on. They are listed in the maven pom files which files
they require.

Other modules require other dependencies; such as camel-jms requires a
JMS provider. To see the exact dependencies of the other modules see the
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/[Maven reports].
