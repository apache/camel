=== How do I debug my route?

If you've created a route and its not doing what you think it is you
could try using one of these features from link:../download.adoc[version 1.4 onwards]:

* link:tracer.adoc[Tracer] to trace in commons-logging / log4j each step
that Camel takes
* link:../debugger.adoc[Debugger] to let you set breakpoints at points in
the route and examine historic message exchanges
* link:../debugger.adoc[Debug] from your unit test if you use the Camel
`camel-test` component

Some link:user-stories.adoc[third party tools] offers Apache Camel route
debugging.
