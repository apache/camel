=== What is a router?

We often talk about that Camel is a mediation and routing framework; so
what exactly is a router and what does it do?

Basically a router just consumes <<message-eip,Message>> exchanges
from some xref:../endpoint.adoc[Endpoint], then sends them on to some other
xref:../endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] using some kind of
xref:../enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

For example a router could implement the
<<contentBasedRouter-eip,Content Based Router>> pattern, to route
from an endpoint to one or more destination endpoints using a
xref:../predicate.adoc[Predicate] based on the message content.

Typically a route or router consists of one or more consumers; either an
<<eventDrivenConsumer-eip,Event Driven Consumer>> or a
<<pollingConsumer-eip,Polling Consumer>> or possibly a
<<transactionalClient-eip,Transactional Client>>. Then there are one
or more xref:../processor.adoc[Processor] instances which could send the
message to one or more endpoints.
