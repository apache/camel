[[WhatjarsdoIneed-WhatjarsdoIneed]]
= What jars do I need?

Camel is designed to be small lightweight and extremely modular so that
you only pay for what you use. The core of camel, *camel-core.jar* is
small and has minimal dependencies.

On Java 6 camel-core.jar only depends on

* *commons-management.jar* (for Camel 2.8 or older)
* *commons-logging.jar* (for Camel 2.6 or older)
* *slf4j-api.jar* (from Camel 2.7 onwards)

On Java 5 camel-core.jar depends also on *activation.jar* and a JAXB2
implementation which typically involves *jaxb-api.jar*, *jaxb-impl.jar*
and a StAX API which may be *stax-api.jar* and *woodstox.jar*.

[[WhatjarsdoIneed-UsingSpring]]
== Using Spring

If you wish to work with Spring, you will also need *camel-spring.jar*
along with the *spring.jar* or the individual spring jars if you prefer.

[[WhatjarsdoIneed-Othercomponents]]
== Other components

For other components you may want to look at the
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/[Maven reports] to see the exact
dependencies of individual modules.

For example to work with JMS you will require the JMS API jar together
with *camel-jms.jar* and your JMS provider of choice such as the
http://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ]
http://activemq.apache.org/initial-configuration.html[required jars].
