= Why is my message empty?

In Camel the message body can be of any types. Some types are safely
readable multiple times, and therefore do not 'suffer' from becoming
'empty'.
So when you message body suddenly is empty, then that is often related
to using a message type that is no re-readable; in other words, the
message
body can only be read once. On subsequent reads the body is now empty.
This happens with types that are streaming based, such as
`java.util.InputStream`, etc.

A number of Camel components supports and use streaming types out of the
box. For example the HTTP related components, CXF, etc.

Camel offers a functionality xref:stream-caching.adoc[Stream caching];
that caches the stream, so it can be re-readable. By enabling this
cache, the message body would no longer be empty.
