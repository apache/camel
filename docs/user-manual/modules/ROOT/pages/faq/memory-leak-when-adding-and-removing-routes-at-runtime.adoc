=== Memory leak when adding and removing routes at runtime

If you add and remove many routes at runtime, then take notice that
link:camel-jmx.adoc[JMX] may take up memory when routes is added.
As Camel cannot 100% reclaim all MBeans when removing a route (some
resources may be shared by other routes, etc.).

Therefore it's advised to disable JMX for new routes, by setting
`registerNewRoutes=false`. See details at link:camel-jmx.adoc[JMX].
