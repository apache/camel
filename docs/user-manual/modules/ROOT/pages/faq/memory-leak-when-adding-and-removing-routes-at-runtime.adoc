= Memory leak when adding and removing routes at runtime

If you add and remove many routes at runtime, then take notice that
xref:components::jmx-component.adoc[JMX] may take up memory when routes is added.
As Camel cannot 100% reclaim all MBeans when removing a route (some
resources may be shared by other routes, etc.).

Therefore it's advised to disable JMX for new routes, by setting
`registerNewRoutes=false`. See details at xref:components::jmx-component.adoc[JMX].
