= Why does FTP component not download any files?

The xref:components::ftp-component.adoc[FTP] component has many options. So make sure you
have configured it properly.
Also a common issue is that you have to use either active or passive
mode. So you may have to set `passiveMode=true` on the endpoint
configuration.
