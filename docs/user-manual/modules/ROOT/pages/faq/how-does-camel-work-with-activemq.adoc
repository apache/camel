=== How does Camel work with ActiveMQ?

You can use Camel to do smart routing and implement the
xref:../enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] inside:

* the ActiveMQ message broker
* the ActiveMQ JMS client

So Camel can route messages to and from xref:mail-component.adoc[Mail],
xref:file-component,File>>, <<ftp-component,FTP>>, <<jpa-component.adoc[JPA],
xref:xmpp-component,XMPP>> other <<jms-component.adoc[JMS] providers and any of the
other Camel xref:../component.adoc[Components] as well as implementating
all of the xref:../enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] such as xref:content-based-router.adoc[Content
Based Router] or xref:messageTranslator-eip.adoc[Message Translator].

EIP].
