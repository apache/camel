= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.19 to 3.20

=== camel-api

The `org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters` is now using `ResourceLoader` from `CamelContext`
to load keystore and other resources in a standard way. Therefore, the `SSLContextParameters` now must have been pre-configured
with a `CamelContext` otherwise an exception is thrown.

== camel-bom

The `camel-bom` BOM no longer includes dependencies with `<type>test-jar</type>` as these are for internal testing
of the Apache Camel project.

The following Maven Plugins has been fixed to use correct GAV:

- camel-debezium-maven-plugin
- camel-salesforce-maven-plugin
- camel-servicenow-maven-plugin

from `<groupdId>org.apache.camel</groupdId>` to `<groupdId>org.apache.camel.maven</groupdId>`.

Dependencies not intended for end users has been removed, such as all `-parent` JARs.

=== camel-log

The log component now shows cached streams (`org.apache.camel.StreamCache`) message bodies by default.
Camel comes with stream caching enabled out-of-the-box, and therefore using the log component you would
expect to see the message body. Setting `showCachedStreams=false` to use old behaviour.

The log component now does not show MEP by default. You can turn this on by `showExchangePattern=true`.

=== camel-jsonpath

There is a new option `unpackArray` that unpacks a single-element Json array, matched by a Jsonpath, into an object. This option is disabled by default (this behaviour was enabled by default in previous Camel versions). There is a new expression `jsonpathUnpack(String text, Class<?> resultType)` that makes use of this new option.
