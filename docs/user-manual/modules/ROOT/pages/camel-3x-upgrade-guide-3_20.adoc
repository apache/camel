= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.20.6 to 3.20.7

The option `replyTimeout` in `camel-spring-rabbitmq` has been fixed and the default value from 5 to 30 seconds
(this is the default used by Spring).

In `camel-jbang` the _Placeholders substitutes_ is changed to use `#name` instead of `$name` syntax.

== Upgrading Camel 3.20.5 to 3.20.6

No changes

== Upgrading Camel 3.20.4 to 3.20.5

In Camel JBang the `-dir` parameter for `init` and `run` goal has been renamed to require 2 dashes `--dir` like all the other options.

== Upgrading Camel 3.20.3 to 3.20.4

No changes

== Upgrading Camel 3.20.2 to 3.20.3

The option `backlogTracing=true` now automatic enabled the tracer on startup. The previous behavior
was _surprisingly_ that the tracer was only made available, and had to be manually enabled afterwards.
The old behavior can be archived by setting `backlogTracingStandby=true`.

The xref:backlog-tracer.adoc[Backlog Tracer] has been enhanced and _fixed_ to trace message headers (also streaming types).
This means that previously headers of type `InputStream` was not traced before, but is now included. This could mean that
the header stream is positioned at end, and logging the header afterward, may appear as the header value is empty.

=== camel-micrometer-starter

The `uri` tags are now static instead of dynamic (by default), as potential too many tags generated due to URI with dynamic values.
This can be enabled again by setting `camel.metrics.uriTagDynamic=true`.

== Upgrading Camel 3.20.1 to 3.20.2

No changes

== Upgrading Camel 3.20.0 to 3.20.1

=== XML DSL

A route now have `<routeProperty>` in the top instead of the bottom.

=== YAML DSL

Using _allowable values_ in Rest with YAML DSL is fixed to use correct name as other DSLs.

Before:

[source,yaml]
----
    value:
    - available
    - pending
    - sold
----

After:

[source,yaml]
----
    allowableValues:
    - available
    - pending
    - sold
----

=== camel-fhir

The following 4 advanced options in fhir data format has been made available for all DSLs:

- fhirContext
- parserErrorHandler
- parserOptions
- forceResourceId

Previously they were only possible to configure by manually creating a bean instance of the model,
and configure them via Java code or classic Spring XML `<bean>` style.

=== camel-kafka

The following options has changed default value as they were mistakenly out of sync with Apache Kafka.
This caused camel-kafka producer to not enable idempotence out of the box, that otherwise plain Apache Kafka client would do:

- enableIdempotence: changed from `false` to `true`
- requestRequiredAcks: changed from `1` to `all`
- retries: changed from `0` to _unset_

== Upgrading Camel 3.19 to 3.20

=== camel-api

The `org.apache.camel.support.jsse.SSLContextParameters` is now using `ResourceLoader` from `CamelContext`
to load keystore and other resources in a standard way. Therefore, the `SSLContextParameters` now must have been pre-configured
with a `CamelContext` otherwise an exception is thrown. This also changes the default resource type from file to classpath.
If using a file resource for a keystore and the keystore is not found, or entries/aliases aren't found, try explicitly
specifying the file resource type, .e.g `file:myKeystore.jks`.

The model class `org.apache.camel.model.errorhandler.ErrorHandlerRefDefinition`
has been renamed to `org.apache.camel.model.errorhandler.RefErrorHandlerDefinition`.

== camel-bom

The `camel-bom` BOM no longer includes dependencies with `<type>test-jar</type>` as these are for internal testing
of the Apache Camel project.

The following Maven Plugins has been fixed to use correct GAV:

- camel-debezium-maven-plugin
- camel-salesforce-maven-plugin
- camel-servicenow-maven-plugin

from `<groupdId>org.apache.camel</groupdId>` to `<groupdId>org.apache.camel.maven</groupdId>`.

Dependencies not intended for end users has been removed, such as all `-parent` JARs.

=== camel-base64

The `base64` property placeholder function will now lookup the value as a property key.
For example

[source,text]
----
{{base64:myKey}}
----

Will now look up myKey as a property placeholder value, which then is decoded.
If you want to decode the value as-is, then use `base64:decode:` as shown below:

[source,text]
----
{{base64:decode:Q2FtZWw==}}
----

=== camel-log

The log component now shows cached streams (`org.apache.camel.StreamCache`) message bodies by default.
Camel comes with stream caching enabled out-of-the-box, and therefore using the log component you would
expect to see the message body. Setting `showCachedStreams=false` to use old behaviour.

The log component now does not show MEP by default. You can turn this on by `showExchangePattern=true`.

=== camel-jsonpath

There is a new option `unpackArray` that unpacks a single-element Json array, matched by a Jsonpath, into an object. This option is disabled by default (this behaviour was enabled by default in previous Camel versions). There is a new expression `jsonpathUnpack(String text, Class<?> resultType)` that makes use of this new option.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

The `error-handler` has been refactored to be aligned with `errorHandler` from the `camel-core-model` DSL, meaning
that it is now the same, how error handlers are in other DSLs.

- `none` is now called `no-error-handler`
- `log` has been removed, as you can use `dead-letter-channel` with a log endpoint as the `dead-letter-uri`.
- `ref` is now `ref-error-handler`.

=== camel-mongodb

The Mongodb Driver core has been updated to version 4.8.1

This fully support MongoDB 6.1

=== camel-google-pubsub

The Camel Google Pubsub headers have been renamed, since dotted keys are not allowed. 

This means all the headers will be "CamelGooglePubsub" prefixed instead of "CamelGooglePubsub."
