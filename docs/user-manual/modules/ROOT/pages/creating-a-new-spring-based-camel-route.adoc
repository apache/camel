= Creating a new Spring based Camel Route

If you want to create your own version of the Spring Example you can
use the maven archetype.

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate                   \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes  \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-spring   \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.5.0             \
  -DgroupId=myGroupId                  \
  -DartifactId=myArtifactId   
----

*Note*: -DarchetypeVersion=1.5.0 is the version number of Camel. Change
this to the current version of Camel you are using.

When using camel archetypes, make sure your package name is not
org.apache.camel (or a sub package of this) as this will instruct Camel
to search in its own packages for your routes. This can also cause Camel
not to start, as shown in CAMEL-1197. You can change your package name
by specifying -Dpackage

This will create a maven project which can be run immediately via the
xref:camel-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Maven Plugin] as follows

[source,shell]
----
cd myArtifactId
mvn camel:run
----

The configuration file is in
*src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-context.xml*.
