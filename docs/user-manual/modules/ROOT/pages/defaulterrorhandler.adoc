= DefaultErrorHandler

This is the default xref:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler] in Camel.

The default xref:error-handler.adoc[Error Handler] has the same power
as the xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel],
however it does *not* support a _dead letter queue_, which is
the only difference between the two of them.

The `DefaultErrorHandler` is configured differently from
xref:components:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel] as
it is configured to:

* not redeliver
* not handled
* no dead letter queue (not possible)

By default, any exception thrown during routing will be propagated back
to the caller and the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] ends immediately.
However, you can use the xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] to
catch a given exception and lower the exception by marking it as
handled. If so, the exception will *not* be sent back to the caller, and
the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] will succeed, but *not continue* being routed.
See the _difference_ between `handled` and `continued` in the
xref:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] documentation.

== Example

In this route below, any exception thrown in, such as the `validateOrder`
bean, will be propagated back to the caller via the jetty endpoint, which
then returns an HTTP error message back to the client.

[source,java]
----
from("jetty:http://localhost/myservice/order")
  .to("bean:validateOrder")
  .to("jms:queue:order");
----

We can add an `onException` in case we want to catch certain exceptions
and route them differently, for instance to catch a
`ValidationException` and return a fixed response to the caller.

[source,java]
----
onException(ValidationException.class)
  .handled(true)
  .transform(body(constant("INVALID ORDER")));

from("jetty:http://localhost/myservice/order")
  .to("bean:validateOrder")
  .to("jms:queue:order");
----

When the `ValidationException` is thrown from the `validateOrder` bean,
it is intercepted by Camel error handler which lets the
`onException(ValidationException.class)` handle the exception.
The xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is routed to this onException route, and
since we use `handled(true)`, then the original exception is cleared,
and we transform the message into a fixed response that is returned to
jetty endpoint that returns it to the original caller.
