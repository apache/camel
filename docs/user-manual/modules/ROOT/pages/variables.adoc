= Variables

*Available from Camel 4.4*

In Camel 4.4, we have introduced the concept of _variables_.

A variable is a key/value that can hold a value that can either be private per `Exchange` or global shared
in the `CamelContext`.

NOTE: You can also use _exchange properties_ as variables but the exchange properties are also used internally by Camel,
and some EIPs and components. With the newly introduced _variables_ then these are exclusively for end users.

== Variable Repository

The variables are stored in one or more `org.apache.camel.spi.VariableRepository`. By default, there are the following repositories

- `ExchangeVariableRepository` - A private repository per `Exchange` that holds variables that are private for the lifecycle of each `Exchange`.
- `GlobalVariableRepository` - Uses `global` as id. A shared global repository for the entire `CamelContext`.

The `ExchangeVariableRepository` is special as its private per exchange and is the default repository when used during routing.

TIP: There is also `org.apache.camel.spi.BrowsableVariableRepository` which is an extension to `VariableRepository` that
has APIs to browse the currently variables. This is used by Camel with Camel JBang, and JMX to be able to see the current variables
from management tooling, CLI and the developer console.

=== Custom variable repositories

You can implement custom `org.apache.camel.spi.VariableRepository` and plugin to be used out of the box with Apache Camel.
For example, you can build a custom repository that stores the variables in a database, so they are persisted.

Each repository must have its own unique id. However, it's also possible to replace the default `global` repository with another.

== Getting and setting variables from Java API

To get a local variable from the current exchange, you can do this via Java API:

[source,java]
----
String myValue = "...";
exchange.setVariable("myKey", myValue);

// and later to get the variable
Object val = exchange.getVariable("myKey");

// you can get the value as a specific type
String str = exchange.getVariable("myKey", String.class);
----

The API on `Exchange` will by default get the variables from its local private repository.
However, you can also get variables from other repositories, such as the `global` as show:

[source,java]
----
Object val = exchange.getVariable("global:myGlobalKey");
----

And you can also assign a global variable by prefixing with `global:` as follows:

[source,java]
----
exchange.setVariable("global:myGlobalKey", someObjectHere);
----

There is also API on `CamelContext` to get variables. However, this API will by default get from the `global` repository,
as it's not possible to get variables from any inflight `Exchange` currently being routed.

[source,java]
----
Object val = context.getVariable("myGlobalKey");

// you can get the value as a specific type
String str = context.getVariable("myGlobalKey", String.class);
----

== Setting and getting variables from DSL

It is also possible to use variables in Camel xref:routes.adoc[routes] using the
xref:components:eips:setVariable-eip.adoc[SetVariable], and xref:components:eips:removeVariable-eip.adoc[RemoveVariable] EIPs.

These EIPs makes it possible to set and remove variables from routes. And you can also access variables from the xref:components:languages:simple-language.adoc[Simple] language.

In the following route we set a variable on the exchange which we use later to build a human-readable event message:

Java::

[source,java]

from("kafka:order.in")
  .setVariable("customerId", jq(".customer.custId"))
  .setVariable("country", jq(".customer.address.co"))
  .transform().simple("Order received from customer ${variable.customerId} in ${variable.country}")
  .to("kafka:order.event");
