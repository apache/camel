= ConsumerTemplate

The `ConsumerTemplate` interface allows you to receive message exchanges from
endpoints in a variety of different ways to make it easy to work with
Camel xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] instances from Java code.

It can be configured with a default endpoint if you just want to receive
lots of messages to the same endpoint; or you can specify an
xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] or uri as the first parameter.

The `receiveBody()` method allows you to receive any object to an endpoint
easily as shown:

[source,java]
----
ConsumerTemplate template = exchange.getContext().createConsumerTemplate();

// recieve from default endpoint
Object body = template.receiveBody();

// receive from a specific queue
body = template.receiveBody("activemq:MyQueue");
----

== Receive modes

The consumer template operates in three modes:

- **receive** - Consumes from the endpoint, waiting until there is a message (can potentially wait for a long time!).
- **receiveNoWait** - Consumes from endpoint, not waiting for a message if none exists.
- **receiveTimeout** - Consumes from the endpoint, waiting until there is a response, or the timeout occurs.

In the previous examples then it was the first mode we used (`receiveBody`).
For example if there are no messages on the `activemq:MyQueue` then Camel would wait until a message is sent to this queue.

Often you dont want to wait _forever_ so its often a good idea to use a timeout value, such as 5 seconds:

[source,java]
----
ConsumerTemplate template = exchange.getContext().createConsumerTemplate();

// receive from a specific queue
body = template.receiveBody("activemq:MyQueue", 5000);
----

Here we wait at most 5 seconds for a message to be consumed, if there was no message, then `null` is returned as response.
