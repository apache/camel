= Camel Spring XML Auto Configuration

This is only applicable when using Spring XML files with the `camel-spring-xml` JAR.

A spring XML file is the XML files that uses `<beans>` as root tag and have an embedded `<camelContext>`.
This is the classic way of using XML DSL with Apache Camel, that was implemented before Spring Boot.

If you use Camel on Spring Boot, then look at xref:camelcontext-autoconfigure.adoc[Camel Context Auto Configuration] instead.

== Auto configuration of Optional Services

Camel will configure these functions by doing a lookup in the Spring
bean registry to find beans of the given type.

The following list all requires at most 1 beans defined. If there are
more than 1 bean of this type, then Camel will *not* use it.
