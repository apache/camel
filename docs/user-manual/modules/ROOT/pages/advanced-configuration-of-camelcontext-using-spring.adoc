= Camel Spring XML Auto Configuration

This is only applicable when using Spring XML files with the `camel-spring-xml` JAR.

A spring XML file is the XML files that uses `<beans>` as root tag and have an embedded `<camelContext>`.
This is the classic way of using XML DSL with Apache Camel. That was implemented before Spring Boot.

If you use Camel on Spring Boot, then look at xref:camelcontext-autoconfigure.adoc[Camel Context Auto Configuration] instead.

== Autoconfiguration of Optional Services

Camel will configure these functions by doing a lookup in the Spring
bean registry to find beans of the given type.

The following list all requires at most one bean defined. If there is
more than one bean of this type, then Camel will *not* use it.
