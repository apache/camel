= Message Endpoint

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageEndpoint.html[Message
Endpoint] from the xref:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[EIP
patterns] using the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface.

When using the xref:dsl.adoc[DSL] to create xref:routes.adoc[Routes] you
typically refer to Message Endpoints by their xref:uris.adoc[URIs]
rather than directly using the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface. Its then a responsibility of the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html[CamelContext]
to create and activate the necessary Endpoint instances using the
available
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Component.html[Component]
implementations.
