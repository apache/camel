= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.20 to 3.21

=== camel-core

XML parsers & XML transformers has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-console

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.console.AbstractDevConsole` has moved from `camel-console` to `camel-support`
and moved to package `org.apache.camel.support.console.AbstractDevConsole`.

Component developers that has plugins for Camel Developer Console, should just use
`camel-support` and `camel-util-json` as dependencies,
and then extend `AbstractDevConsole` for custom console implementations.

=== camel-main

The option `camel.main.routesReloadRestartDuration` has changed its default value from `true` to `false`.

=== camel-jaxb

When using schema validation, then access to external DTD/Schema is disabled by default.
To enable access, then set `accessExternalSchemaProtocols=all` or specify allowed protocols, such as
`accessExternalSchemaProtocols=file`.

=== camel-stax

XML parser in `StAXJAXBIteratorExpression` has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-xmlsecurity

XML parsers has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-jbang

The command `camel dependencies` has been renamed to `camel dependency`.

=== camel-spring-boot

The health-check has aligned to be more similar to microprofile-health in the JSon output.
Spring Boot now also includes additional data per check, when using full exposure level.

For example as shown below for the context health check:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "camelHealth": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "name": "camel-health-check",
        "context": "UP",
        "context.data": {
          "invocation.count": "1",
          "context.phase": "5",
          "invocation.time": "2022-12-21T09:12:03.307871+01:00[Europe/Oslo]",
          "check.group": "camel",
          "context.name": "MyCamel",
          "success.time": "2022-12-21T09:12:03.307871+01:00[Europe/Oslo]",
          "success.count": "1",
          "check.id": "context",
          "context.version": "3.21.0",
          "context.status": "Started",
          "success.start.time": "2022-12-21T09:12:03.307871+01:00[Europe/Oslo]",
          "check.kind": "READINESS",
          "failure.count": "0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

=== camel-java-joor-dsl

The `camel-java-joor-dsl` cannot anymore load routes defined in class files as we consider it no more needed, consequently the ability to configure the compile directory and the compile load first flag using the corresponding `camel-main` properties is no longer possible.

=== camel-elasticsearch

The `certificatePath` parameter can now be specified as resource: for user pointing to a local certificate, the file should be now prefixed with `file:`. It's also possible to use the classic resource helper prefixes, like `classpath`, `https` etc.

=== camel-rest

The deprecated option `componentName` was removed. Please use either `producerComponentName` or `consumerComponentName`.

=== Deprecated Components

The following components that had been marked as deprecated, were removed in this release:

* camel-dozer
* camel-cmis
