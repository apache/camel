= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.20 to 3.21

=== camel-core

XML parsers & XML transformers has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-console

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.console.AbstractDevConsole` has moved from `camel-console` to `camel-support`
and moved to package `org.apache.camel.support.console.AbstractDevConsole`.

Component developers that has plugins for Camel Developer Console, should just use
`camel-support` and `camel-util-json` as dependencies,
and then extend `AbstractDevConsole` for custom console implementations.

=== camel-health

The `org.apache.camel.health.HealthCheck` method `isLiveness` is now default `false` instead of `true`.

Camel provides the `CamelContextCheck` as both readiness and liveness checks, so there is at least
one of each out of the box.

=== camel-main

The option `camel.main.routesReloadRestartDuration` has changed its default value from `true` to `false`.

=== camel-azure-cosmosdb

The option `itemPartitionKey` has been updated. Now it's a String and not a PartitionKey POJO anymore. More details in CAMEL-19222.

=== camel-http-common

The API in `org.apache.camel.http.common.HttpBinding` has changed slightly to be more reusable.
The `parseBody` method now takes in `HttpServletRequest` as input parameter. And all `HttpMessage`
has been changed to generic `Message` types.

=== camel-jaxb

When using schema validation, then access to external DTD/Schema is disabled by default.
To enable access, then set `accessExternalSchemaProtocols=all` or specify allowed protocols, such as
`accessExternalSchemaProtocols=file`.

=== camel-stax

XML parser in `StAXJAXBIteratorExpression` has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-cm-sms

XML parsers has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-schematron

XML parsers has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-xmlsecurity

XML parsers has been made more secure by disabling DOCTYPE and/or access to external DTD/Schema.

=== camel-jbang

The command `camel dependencies` has been renamed to `camel dependency`.

=== camel-spring-boot

The health-check has aligned to be more similar to microprofile-health in the JSon output.
Spring Boot now also includes additional data per check, when using full exposure level.

For example as shown below for the context health check:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "camelHealth": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "name": "camel-health-check",
        "context": "UP",
        "context.data": {
          "invocation.count": "1",
          "context.phase": "5",
          "invocation.time": "2022-12-21T09:12:03.307871+01:00[Europe/Oslo]",
          "check.group": "camel",
          "context.name": "MyCamel",
          "success.time": "2022-12-21T09:12:03.307871+01:00[Europe/Oslo]",
          "success.count": "1",
          "check.id": "context",
          "context.version": "3.21.0",
          "context.status": "Started",
          "success.start.time": "2022-12-21T09:12:03.307871+01:00[Europe/Oslo]",
          "check.kind": "READINESS",
          "failure.count": "0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

=== camel-java-joor-dsl

The `camel-java-joor-dsl` cannot anymore load routes defined in class files as we consider it no more needed, consequently the ability to configure the compile directory and the compile load first flag using the corresponding `camel-main` properties is no longer possible.

=== camel-elasticsearch

The `certificatePath` parameter can now be specified as resource: for user pointing to a local certificate, the file should be now prefixed with `file:`. It's also possible to use the classic resource helper prefixes, like `classpath`, `https` etc.

=== camel-rest

The deprecated option `componentName` was removed. Please use either `producerComponentName` or `consumerComponentName`.

=== camel-micrometer

The metrics has been renamed to follow Micrometer naming convention https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_naming_meters[Naming Meters].

|===
| Old Name | New Name
| CamelExchangeEventNotifier | camel.exchange.event.notifier
| CamelExchangesFailed | camel.exchanges.failed
| CamelExchangesFailuresHandled | camel.exchanges.failures.handled
| CamelExchangesInflight | camel.exchanges.external.redeliveries

| CamelRoutesAdded | camel.routes.added
| CamelRoutesRunning | camel.routes.running
|===

=== Deprecated Components

The following components that had been marked as deprecated, were removed in this release:

* camel-dozer
* camel-cmis

== Backlog Tracing

The option `backlogTracing=true` now automatic enabled the tracer on startup. The previous behavior
was _surprisingly_ that the tracer was only made available, and had to be manually enabled afterwards.
The old behavior can be archived by setting `backlogTracingStandby=true`.

Move the following class from `org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean.BacklogTracerEventMessage` in `camel-management-api` JAR
to `org.apache.camel.spi.BacklogTracerEventMessage` in `camel-api` JAR.


== Camel Spring Boot

The `camel-spring-boot` dependency no longer includes `camel-spring-xml`. To use legacy Spring XML files `<beans>`
with Camel on Spring Boot, then include the `camel-spring-boot-xml-starter` dependency.

=== camel-micrometer-starter

The `uri` tags are now static instead of dynamic (by default), as potential too many tags generated due to URI with dynamic values.
This can be enabled again by setting `camel.metrics.uriTagDynamic=true`.

=== camel-platform-http-starter

The `platform-http-starter` has been changed from using `camel-servlet` to use Spring HTTP server directly.
Therefore, all the HTTP endpoints are no longer prefixed with the servlet context-path (default is `camel`).

For example:

[source,java]
----
from("platform-http:myservice")
  .to("...")
----

Then calling _myservice_ would before require to include the context-path, such as `http://localhost:8080/camel/myservice`.
Now the context-path is not in use, and the endpoint can be called with `http://localhost:8080/myservice`.

NOTE: The `platform-http-starter` can also be used with Rest DSL.
