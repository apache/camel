[[toD-eip]]
== To D EIP

There is a new `.toD` / `<toD>` that allows to send a message to a dynamic
computed <<Endpoint-Endpoints,Endpoint>> using one or
more link:expression.html[Expression] that are concat together. By
default the <<simple-language,Simple>> language is used to compute
the endpoint.

=== Options

// eip options: START
The To D EIP supports 5 options which are listed below:

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *uri* | *Required* The uri of the endpoint to send to. The uri can be dynamic computed using the org.apache.camel.language.simple.SimpleLanguage expression. |  | String
| *pattern* | Sets the optional ExchangePattern used to invoke this endpoint |  | ExchangePattern
| *cacheSize* | Sets the maximum size used by the org.apache.camel.spi.ConsumerCache which is used to cache and reuse producers. |  | Integer
| *ignoreInvalidEndpoint* | Ignore the invalidate endpoint exception when try to create a producer with that endpoint | false | Boolean
| *allowOptimisedComponents* | Whether to allow components to optimise toD if they are org.apache.camel.spi.SendDynamicAware. | true | Boolean
|===
// eip options: END

=== Samples

For example to send a message to a endpoint defined by a
header you can do as shown below:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .toD("${header.foo}");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <toD uri="${header.foo}"/>
</route>
----

You can also prefix the uri with a value because by default the uri is
evaluated using the <<simple-language,Simple>> language

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .toD("mock:${header.foo}");
----

And in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <toD uri="mock:${header.foo"/>
</route>
----

In the example above we compute an endpoint that has prefix "mock:" and
then the header foo is appended. So for example if the header foo has
value order, then the endpoint is computed as "mock:order".

You can also use other languages than <<simple-language,Simple>> such
as <<xpath-language,XPath>> - this requires to prefix with language: as
shown below (simple language is the default language). If you do not
specify language: then the endpoint is a component name. And in some
cases there is both a component and language with the same name such as
xquery.

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <toD uri="language:xpath:/order/@uri"/>
</route>
----

This is done by specifying the name of the language followed by a colon.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .toD("language:xpath:/order/@uri");
----

You can also concat multiple <<language-component,Language>>(s) together
using the plus sign `+` such as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <toD uri="jms:${header.base}+language:xpath:/order/@id"/>
</route>
----

In the example above the uri is a combination
of <<simple-language,Simple>> language and <<simple-language,XPath>> where
the first part is simple (simple is default language). And then the plus
sign separate to another language, where we specify the language name
followed by a colon

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
  .toD("jms:${header.base}+language:xpath:/order/@id");
----

You can concat as many languages as you want, just separate them with
the plus sign

=== Avoid creating endless dynamic endpoints which takes up resources

When using dynamic computed endpoints with `toD` then you may compute a lot of dynamic endpoints,
which results in an overhead of resources in use, by each dynamic endpoint uri, and its associated producer.

For example HTTP based endpoints where you may have dynamic values in URI parameters when calling the HTTP service, such as:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080/login?userid=${header.userName}");
----

In the example above then the parameter `userid` is dynamic computed, and would result in one instance of endpoint and producer
for each different userid. To avoid having too many dynamic endpoints you can configure `toD` to reduce its cache size, for example:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080/login?cacheSize=10&userid=${header.userName}");
----

where the cache is 10. *Important* this will only reduce the endpoint cache of the `toD` that has a chance
of being reused in case a message is routed with the same `userName` header. Therefore reducing the cache size
will not solve the _endless dynamic endoints_ problem. Instead you should use static endpoints with `to` and
provide the dynamic parts in Camel message headers (if possible).

The example above can resolve via static endpoints, or from Camel 2.22 onwards via optimised components (see further below)

==== Using static endpoints

In the example above then the parameter `userid` is dynamic computed, and would result in one instance of endpoint and producer
for each different userid. To avoid having too dynamic endpoints you use a single static endpoint and use headers to provide the dynamic parts:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH, constant("/login"))
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_QUERY, simple("userid=${header.userName}"))
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080");
----

If you are using Camel 2.22 onwards then you can use its optimised components for `toD` that can _solve_ this out of the box,
as documented next.

=== Using optimised components

But a better solution would be if the HTTP component could be optimised to handle the variations of dynamic computed endpoint uris.
This is now possible with *Camel 2.22* onwards, where the following components has been optimised for `toD`:

- camel-http
- camel-http4
- camel-jetty
- camel-netty4-http
- camel-undertow

For the optimisation to work, then:

1. The optimisation is detected and activated during startup of the Camel routes with `toD`'s.
2. The dynamic uri in `toD` must provide the component name as either static or resolved via property placeholders.
3. The supported components must be on the classpath.

The HTTP based components will be optimised to use the same hostname:port for each endpoint, and the dynamic values
for context-path and query parameters will be provided as headers:

For example this route:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080/login?userid=${header.userName}");
----

will essentially be optimised to (pseudo route):

[source,java]
----
from("direct:login")
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH, expression("/login"))
  .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_QUERY, expression("userid=${header.userName}"))
  .toD("http:myloginserver:8080")
  .removeHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH)
  .removeHeader(Exchange.HTTP_QUERY);
----

Where _expression_ will be evaluated dynamically. Notice how the uri in `toD` is now static (`http:myloginserver:8080`).
This optimisation allows Camel to reuse the same endpoint and its associated producer for all dynamic variations.
This yields much lower resource overhead as the same http producer will be used for all the different variations of userid's.

NOTE: When the optimised component is in use, then you cannot use the headers `Exchange.HTTP_PATH` and `Exchange.HTTP_QUERY`
to provide dynamic values to override the uri in `toD`. If you want to use these headers, then use the plain `to` DSL instead.
In other words these headers are used internally by `toD` to carry the dynamic details of the endpoint.

In case of problems then you can turn on DEBUG logging level on `org.apache.camel.processor.SendDynamicProcessor` which will log
during startup if `toD` was optimised, or if there was a failure loading the optimised component, with a stacktrace logged.
