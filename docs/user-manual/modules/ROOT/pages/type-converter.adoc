= Type Converter

Converting body payloads from one type to another is common when routing messages between endpoints.
Conversions regularly occur between the following types:

* `File`
* `String`
* `byte[]` and `ByteBuffer`
* `InputStream` and `OutputStream`
* `Reader` and `Writer`
* XML payloads such as `Document` and `Source`

For example to convert the message body to XML `Document` type
then this can be done as follows in Java:

[source,java]
----
Message message = exchange.getMessage();
Document document = message.getBody(Document.class);
----

Notice that the code only tells Camel what you *want* as the result type (`Document`)
and not what the input type is, or how Camel should do this.

== How Type Conversion works

The type conversion strategy is defined by the
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/current/org/apache/camel/TypeConverter.html[TypeConverter]
interface. The interface has several methods, however the most important and common API is:

[source,java]
----
<T> T convertTo(Class<T> type, Exchange exchange, Object value) throws TypeConversionException;
----

This API is used by Camel when it converts an object from one type to another. However if
you pay attention then this API only has the result type in the contract. The input type
is inferred from the _value_ parameter.

There are many type converters in Camel, some comes out of the box from camel-core, and others
are additional converters that are shipped in various Camel components.

=== Type converter registry

To keep track of all those converters, then Camel has a registry for type converters
(`org.apache.camel.spi.TypeConverterRegistry`).

This registry keeps track of all possible type converter combinations, such as which converters
that can convert to an `InputStream` and so forth.

So the example from before, what Camel would do is to lookup in the `TypeConverterRegistry`
to find a suitable converter that can convert the given input value to the `Document` type.

The `TypeConverterRegistry` can be accessed via Java:

[source,java]
----
TypeConverterRegistry tcr = camelContext.getTypeConverterRegistry();
TypeConverter tc = tcr.lookup(Document.class, InputStream.class);
----

However often you would not work directly with the `TypeConverterRegistry` or `TypeConverter` APIs in Camel;
as type conversion are often implicit in use where you would just declare the result type; and Camel takes care of this.

[NOTE]
====
In Camel, all the official Camel components, come with source code generated `TypeConverter`
(via `camel-component-maven-plugin`) that allows Camel to load these converters very quickly,
and invoke these type converters at runtime via quick Java method invocations (no reflection overhead).
====

=== Type converter registry utilization statistics

Camel can gather utilization statistics of the runtime usage of type
converters. These statistics are available in xref:jmx.adoc[JMX] as well as
from https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-api/latest/org/apache/camel/spi/TypeConverterRegistry.html#getStatistics--[`TypeConverterRegistry#getStatistics()`].

These statistics are turned off by
default as there is some performance overhead under very high concurrent load.

Enabling statistics in Java:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...;
context.setTypeConverterStatisticsEnabled(true);
----

Enabling statistics in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext typeConverterStatisticsEnabled="true">
    ...
</camelContext>
----

== TypeConverter using @Converter annotation

All the type converters that come out of the box are coded as Java methods on _converter_ classes.

This means a class has been annotated with `@Converter` and the methods in the class
annotated with `@Converter` become a type converter _pair_ like in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Converter(generateLoader = true)
public class IOConverter {
    @Converter
    public static InputStream toInputStream(File file) throws FileNotFoundException {
        return new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
    }
}
----

This is from camel-core where the `IOConverter` class has a number of converters (only 1 shown).
The method `toInputStream` is annotated with `@Converter` which then becomes a type converter
that can convert from `File` to `InputStream`.

All these _converter_ classes are discovered and loaded by Camel.

== Discovering Type Converters

Camel automatically discovers and loads the type converters from all JARs on the classpath at startup.

Camel searches the classpath for a file called
`META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/TypeConverterLoader` which lists
all type converter loader classes. These are automatically generated by the Camel Component Package Plugin.
These _loader_ classes will load the type converters into the Camel type converter registry
and invoke them in a _fast way_ using standard Java method calls.

=== Discovering Type Converters (fast way)

To enable the fast type converter way, you should enable `generateLoader = true`
on the class level annotation as shown:

[source,java]
----
@Converter(generateLoader = true)
public class IOConverter {
    @Converter
    public static InputStream toInputStream(File file) throws FileNotFoundException {
        return new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
    }
}
----

And then you should have the xref:camel-component-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Component Package Plugin] in as build plugin when compiling the project.

=== Discovering Type Converters in the fastest way

In Camel 3.7 we optimized the type converter system for optimal performance when using the built-in converters.
This was done by bulking together all the converters in the same Maven module into a single class. The class has a single
`convert` method where all the supported converters are available and discovered in a fast way using Java primitives.

To enable this then set `generateBulkLoader=true` in the class `@Converter` annotation. You should do this for all the converter
classes within the same Maven artifact. Then they will be bulked together into a single class.

[source,java]
----
@Converter(generateBulkLoader = true)
public class IOConverter {
    @Converter
    public static InputStream toInputStream(File file) throws FileNotFoundException {
        return new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
    }
}
----

There are few limitations:

- fallback converters are not supported
- the order of the `@Converter` methods matters. If you have multiple `@Converter` methods that accept as _from_ type
types which are from the same class hierarchy then put the methods first that are the most concrete.

For example in `camel-xml-jaxp` we have in the `XmlConverter` multiple `@Converter` methods which can convert to `DomSource`.
We had to put the method that takes `org.w3c.dom.Document` before the method that takes `org.w3c.dom.Node` as `Document` extends `Node`.

The following code shows snippet of the source code generated bulk class. As you can see we have the `Document` method before the `Node` method below:

[source,java]
----
        } else if (to == javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource.class) {
            if (value instanceof org.w3c.dom.Document) {
                return getXmlConverter().toDOMSource((org.w3c.dom.Document) value);
            }
            if (value instanceof org.w3c.dom.Node) {
                return getXmlConverter().toDOMSource((org.w3c.dom.Node) value);
            }
----

=== Returning null values

By default, when using a method in a POJO annotation with `@Converter`
returning `null` is not a valid response. If null is returned, then Camel
will regard that type converter as a _miss_, and prevent from using it
in the future. If `null` should be allowed as a valid response, then
you must specify this in the annotation (via `allowNull`) as shown:

[source,java]
----
@Converter(allowNull = true)
public static InputStream toInputStream(File file) throws IOException {
    if (file.exist()) {
        return new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
----

== Fallback Type Converters

The
https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-base/current/org/apache/camel/impl/converter/AnnotationTypeConverterLoader.html[AnnotationTypeConverterLoader]
has been enhanced to also look for methods defined with a
`@FallbackConverter` annotation, and register it as a fallback type
converter.

Fallback type converters are used as a last resort for converting a
given value to another type. It is used when the regular type converters
give up.
The fallback converters are also meant for a broader scope, so its method
signature is a bit different:

[source,java]
----
@FallbackConverter
public static <T> T convertTo(Class<T> type, Exchange exchange, Object value, TypeConverterRegistry registry)
----

Or you can use the non-generic signature.

[source,java]
----
@FallbackConverter
public static Object convertTo(Class type, Exchange exchange, Object value, TypeConverterRegistry registry)
----

And the method name can be anything (`convertTo` is not required as a
name), so it can be named `convertMySpecialTypes` if you like. +
The `Exchange` parameter is optional, just like the regular
`@Converter` methods.

The purpose with this broad scope method signature is allowing you to
control if you can convert the given type or not. The `type` parameter
holds the type we want the `value` converted to. It is used internally in
Camel for wrapper objects, so we can delegate the type conversion to the
body that is wrapped.

For instance in the method below we will handle all type conversions
that are based on the wrapper class `GenericFile` and we let Camel do the
type conversions on its body instead.

[source,java]
----
@FallbackConverter
public static <T> T convertTo(Class<T> type, Exchange exchange, Object value, TypeConverterRegistry registry) {
    // use a fallback type converter so we can convert the embedded body
    // if the value is GenericFile
    if (GenericFile.class.isAssignableFrom(value.getClass())) {
        GenericFile file = (GenericFile) value;
        Class from = file.getBody().getClass();
        TypeConverter tc = registry.lookup(type, from);
        if (tc != null) {
            Object body = file.getBody();
            return tc.convertTo(type, exchange, body);
        }
    }
    return null;
}
----

== Writing your own Type Converters

You are welcome to write your own converters. Remember to use the
`@Converter` annotations on the classes and methods you wish to use.
And on the top-level class add `Converter(generateLoader = true)` to support the _fast way_
of using type converters.

* static methods are encouraged to reduce caching, but instance methods
are fine, particularly if you want to allow optional dependency
injection to customize the converter
* converter methods should be thread safe and reentrant

=== Exchange parameter

The type converter accepts the `Exchange` as an optional 2nd parameter.
This is usable if the type converter for instance needs information from
the current exchange. For instance combined with the encoding support
it is possible for type converters to convert with the configured
encoding. An example from camel-core for the `byte[]` -> `String`
converter:

[source,java]
----
@Converter
public static String toString(byte[] data, Exchange exchange) {
    String charsetName = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.CHARSET_NAME, String.class);
    if (charsetName != null) {
        try {
            return new String(data, charsetName);
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
    return new String(data);
}
