= Component DSL

Component-DSL is a builder API that allows using type safe construction of
Camel xref:component.adoc[Components] and inject them directly to xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext]
instead of initializing through a constructor.

The Component DSL is exclusively available as part of the Java DSL.

== Using Component DSL

The following is an example of Kafka component that is constructed using the typical constructor initialization:

[source,java]
----
KafkaComponent kafka = new KafkaComponent();
kafka.setBrokers("localhost:9090");

camelContext.addComponent("kafka", kafka);
----

The same Java statement can be rewritten in the following more readable way using the new `ComponentsBuilderFactory` that allows the access to all component DSLs in Camel:

[source,java]
----
ComponentsBuilderFactory.kafka()
                        .brokers("{{kafka.host}}:{{kafka.port}}")
                        .register(camelContext, "kafka");
----

In order to explain it better, we can break down the above Java statement into 3 parts:

. `ComponentsBuilderFactory.kafka()`: This will initialize the DSL for `camel-kafka` component.
. `.brokers("{{kafka.host}}:{{kafka.port}}")`: This is the equivalent setter of `kafka.setBrokers("localhost:9090")` using DSL fluent builder.
. `.register(camelContext, "kafka")`: Here we register directly the component under name `kafka` into Camel context, of course you can use any component name you like, just like `addComponent` API. 

=== Type Safety

Similar to the xref:Endpoint-dsl.adoc[Endpoint DSL], uses the meta-model, which is extracted from the source and
written in various JSON files, to generate a fluent DSL for each component. This fluent DSL provides type safety for parameters.


== Dependency

In order to use this feature, Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-componentdsl</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
----

And then use it just like how we demonstrated it earlier in this page.
