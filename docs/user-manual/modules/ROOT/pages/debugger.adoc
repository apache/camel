= Debugger

*Since Camel 2.6*

Camel Debugger is much related to
Tracer, in fact they are sisters. Debugger is a
enhanced tracer with a debugger framework so that tooling can be
developed to easily monitor Camel routes, trace messages and set
breakpoints at points in a route etc.

TIP:There is also a BacklogDebugger which allows
to debug from JMX, and 3rd party tooling.

[[Debugger-AbouttheDebugger]]
== About the Debugger

The Debugger allows tooling or the likes to attach breakpoints which is
being invoked when Exchanges is being routed.

[[Debugger-Defaultimplementation]]
== Default implementation

Camel provides a default implementation
`org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultDebugger` which you can set on the
`CamelContext` using the `setDebugger` method. +
 Likewise you can get hold of the Debugger using the
`getDebugger` method on `CamelContext`.

The `org.apache.camel.spi.Debugger` has methods to attach and remove
breakpoints. And to suspend/resume all breakpoints etc. +
 You can also attach a condition to the breakpoint so it only reacts if
the condition matches.

[[Debugger-EasilydebuggingCamelroutesfromcamel-test]]
== Easily debugging Camel routes from `camel-test`

If you are developing unit tests using the `camel-test` component, then
the Debugger comes out of the box. +
 From *Camel 2.9* onwards you would need to explicit enable the
debugger, by overriding `isUseDebugger()` method and return `true`.

[[Debugger-Example]]
=== Example

In this unit test

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
public class DebugTest extends CamelTestSupport
-----------------------------------------------

We want to debug the following route

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
@Override
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
    return new RouteBuilder() {
        @Override
        public void configure() throws Exception {
            // this is the route we want to debug
            from("direct:start")
                .to("mock:a")
                .transform(body().prepend("Hello "))
                .to("mock:b");
        }
    };
}
-----------------------------------------------

Which can easily done by overriding the `debugBefore` method as shown

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
@Override
public boolean isUseDebugger() {
    // must enable debugger
    return true;
}
 
@Override
protected void debugBefore(Exchange exchange, Processor processor,
                           ProcessorDefinition<?> definition, String id, String shortName) {
    // this method is invoked before we are about to enter the given processor
    // from your Java editor you can just add a breakpoint in the code line below
    log.info("Before " + definition + " with body " + exchange.getIn().getBody());
}
-----------------------------------------------

Then from your Java editor just add a breakpoint inside the
`debugBefore` method. Then fire up the unit test and wait for the Java
editor to hit the breakpoint. Then you can inspect the
Exchange during debugging while it advances during
routing. The `ProcessorDefinition` and the `id` and `shortName`
parameters is all information which tells you where in the route the
breakpoint was hit. 

TIP:There is also a `debugAfter` method which is invoked after the processor
has been invoked. This allows you to _see_ what happens to the
Exchange right after it has invoked a processor in
the route.

The screenshot below shows the Debugger in action.
The IDE (IDEA) has hit the breakpoint and we can inspect the
parameters. +
 Notice how we can see that the message is to be send to the "mock:a"
endpoint.
