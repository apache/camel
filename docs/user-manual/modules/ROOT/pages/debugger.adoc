= Debugger

The Camel Debugger is intended for 3rd party tooling to make it possible to
debug routes, trace messages and to use breakpoints with the EIP patterns in the Camel routes.

The Debugger allows tooling or the likes to attach breakpoints which is
being invoked when xref:exchange.adoc[Exchanges] are routed.

== Java Debugging Camel routes in unit tests

If you are developing unit tests using the `camel-test-junit5` component, then
the Debugger is available if you turn it on via overriding the `isUseDebugger()`
method and return `true`.

In this unit test

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
public class DebugTest extends CamelTestSupport
-----------------------------------------------

We want to debug the following route

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
@Override
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
    return new RouteBuilder() {
        @Override
        public void configure() throws Exception {
            // this is the route we want to debug
            from("direct:start")
                .to("mock:a")
                .transform(body().prepend("Hello "))
                .to("mock:b");
        }
    };
}
-----------------------------------------------

Which can easily done by overriding the `debugBefore` method as shown

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
@Override
public boolean isUseDebugger() {
    // must enable debugger
    return true;
}
 
@Override
protected void debugBefore(Exchange exchange, Processor processor,
                           ProcessorDefinition<?> definition, String id, String shortName) {
    // this method is invoked before we are about to enter the given processor
    // from your Java editor you can just add a breakpoint in the code line below
    log.info("Before " + definition + " with body " + exchange.getIn().getBody());
}
-----------------------------------------------

Then from your Java editor just add a breakpoint inside the
`debugBefore` method. Then fire up the unit test and wait for the Java
editor to hit the breakpoint. Then you can inspect the
Exchange during debugging while it advances during
routing. The `ProcessorDefinition` and the `id` and `shortName`
parameters is all information which tells you where in the route the
breakpoint was hit. 

TIP: There is also a `debugAfter` method which is invoked after the processor
has been invoked. This allows you to _see_ what happens to the
Exchange right after it has invoked a processor in the route.

The screenshot below shows the Debugger in action.
The IDE (IDEA) has hit the breakpoint, and we can inspect the
parameters. Notice how we can see that the message is to be sent to the mock:a
endpoint.

=== Java debugging of Camel routes written with Java DSL

A trick to debug a Camel route written with Java DSL is to modify the route to insert a `processor` and then to set the breakpoint in it.

For instance:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------
public class MyRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("timer:demo").routeId("foo")
        	.bean("myBean", "hello")
			.process(new Processor() {
				@Override
				public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
					System.out.println("put a breakpoint here");
				}
			})
        	.log("${body}")
        	.bean("myBean", "bye")
        	.log("${body}");
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------

=== Implementing a custom debugger

The debugger API is defined in `org.apache.camel.spi.Debugger`.
This API has methods to attach and remove breakpoints.

And to suspend/resume all breakpoints etc.
You can also attach a condition to the breakpoint, so it only reacts if
the condition matches.

Camel provides a base implementation `org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultDebugger`,
which can be used to extend for custom implementations.

=== Camel Route debugger through JMX

There is also a xref:backlog-debugger.adoc[Backlog Debugger] which allows debugging from JMX. It is automatically provided when `camel-debug` is on the classpath (since 3.16) or when using the `camel:debug` Maven goal (since 3.18).

To be able to have enough time to add your breakpoints, since 3.18, you could need to suspend the message processing of Camel to make sure
that you won't miss any messages. For this kind of need, you have to set either the environment variable `CAMEL_DEBUGGER_SUSPEND` or the system property `org.apache.camel.debugger.suspend` to `true` within the context of your application, then the `Backlog Debugger` suspends the message processing until the JMX operation `attach` is called. Calling the JMX operation `detach` suspends again the message processing.

In case the environment variable and the system property are both set, the value of the environment variable is used.

Several 3rd party tooling are using it:

* https://hawt.io/[hawtio] uses this for its web based debugging functionality
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-debug-adapter-apache-camel[VS Code Debug Adapter for Camel]
* http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textual-debugging-apache-camel[Eclipse Desktop Debug Adapter for Camel]
* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9371-apache-camel[IntelliJ Camel plugin]
* https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-debug-adapter[Debug Adapter Server for Camel]

Camel requires to have `camel-management` JAR on the classpath for having JMX enabled.
