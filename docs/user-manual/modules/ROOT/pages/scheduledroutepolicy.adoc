A scheduled xref:route-policy.adoc[Route Policy]
`org.apache.camel.routepolicy.quartz.ScheduledRoutePolicy` is an
extensible abstract policy that is used to provide Camel routes
scheduling capabilities at runtime.

Scheduling of routes typically involves the following capabilities:

* _Route activation_ - Starting a route a given start time if the route is
in a stopped state awaiting activation.
* _Route de-activation_ - Shutting down an otherwise active and started
route at a given time.
* _Route suspension_ - Simply de-activating the route consumer endpoint
URI declared on the `from(...)` section of the route from listening on a
given port. The route is still considered as started, however, clients
will not be able to send requests along the route.
* _Route resumption_ - Resuming the listener on a formerly suspended route
consumer endpoint URI. This route is ready to accept requests following
route resumption and client requests will be accepted by the route
consumer to be forwarded along the route.

Camel offers two such concrete policies that offer scheduled route policy
support:

* xref:simplescheduledroutepolicy.adoc[SimpleScheduledRoutePolicy] - An
ability to offer route scheduling services using a Simple xref:components::quartz-component.adoc[Quartz] trigger.
* xref:cronscheduledroutepolicy.adoc[CronScheduledRoutePolicy] - An
ability to offer route scheduling services using a Cron based xref:components::quartz-component.adoc[Quartz]
trigger.
