= ScheduledRoutePolicy

A scheduled route policy
`org.apache.camel.routepolicy.quartz.ScheduledRoutePolicy` is an
extensible abstract policy that is used to provide camel route
scheduling capabilities at runtime.

Scheduling of routes typically involves the following capabilities

* Route activation - Starting a route a given start time if the route is
in a stopped state awaiting activation.
* Route de-activation - Shutting down an otherwise active and started
route at a given time.
* Route suspension - Simply de-activating the route consumer endpoint
URI declared on the from(...) section of the route from listening on a
given port. The route is still considered as started, however, clients
will not be able to send requests along the route.
* Route resumption - Resuming the listener on a formerly suspended route
consumer endpoint URI. This route is ready to accept requests following
route resumption and client requests will be accepted by the route
consumer to be forwarded along the route.
