Camel Boot
~~~~~~~~~~

Camel lets you boot up a JVM process and configure Camel nicely using
whichever dependency injection framework you choose.

For each of the main dependency injection frameworks, Camel has a Main
class with a `public static void run(String[] args)` function so that
you can boot up your JVM which then also bootstraps the Dependency
Injection framework to load all the camel contexts and services
required.

The following camel boot options are supported:

[[CamelBoot-CDI]]
CDI
^^^

Using the <<cdi-component,camel-cdi module>> you can boot up your Camel
Java process using the *org.apache.camel.cdi.Main* class

[[CamelBoot-Spring]]
Spring
^^^^^^

Using the <<SpringSupport-SpringSupport,camel-spring module>> you can boot your
Camel Java process using the *org.apache.camel.spring.Main* class

[[CamelBoot-SpringBoot]]
Spring Boot
^^^^^^^^^^^

You can combine Spring Boot with Camel using
<<SpringBoot-SpringBoot,Camel's Spring Boot integration>>. In this case
your application looks and feels like a regular Spring Boot application
but with full Camel integration.
