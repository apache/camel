= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.6 to 3.7

=== Modularized core

The core has been further modularized and is now split up into three new core modules

- camel-core-model
- camel-core-reifier
- camel-core-processor

This separates the route model from the runtime processors via the reifiers, by having the classes in their own modules.

=== API changes

The class `BreakpointSupport` has moved from `org/apache/camel/processor/interceptor/BreakpointSupport` to `org.apache.camel.support.BreakpointSupport`.

These internal classes has been moved to locations that better suit where other similar processors are located.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.validator.ProcessorValidator` moved to `org.apache.camel.processor.validator.ProcessorValidator`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.transformer.ProcessorTransformer` moved to `org.apache.camel.processor.transformer.ProcessorTransformer`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.transformer.DataFormatTransformer` moved to `org.apache.camel.processor.transformer.DataFormatTransformer`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.validator.ValidatorKey` moved to `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.ValidatorKey`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.transformer.TransformerKey` moved to `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.TransformerKey`.

And the class `org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExecutorServiceManager` is moved from `camel-core-engine` JAR to
`org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultExecutorServiceManager` in the `camel-base` JAR.

The class `org.apache.camel.processor.ConvertBodyProcessor` is moved
to `org.apache.camel.support.ConvertBodyProcessor` in the `camel-support` JAR.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultClaimCheckRepository` moved
to `org.apache.camel.processor.DefaultClaimCheckRepository` in the `camel-core-processor` JAR.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultProducerCache` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.DefaultProducerCache`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultConsumerCache` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.DefaultConsumerCache`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.EmptyProducerCache` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.EmptyProducerCache`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.ServicePool` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.ServicePool`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.ProducerServicePool` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.ProducerServicePool`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.PollingConsumerServicePool` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.PollingConsumerServicePool`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.EventNotifierCallback` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.EventNotifierCallback`.

The interface `org.apache.camel.spi.LifecycleStrategy` has two methods removed related to adding and removing error handlers.

=== Type Converters

Camel 3.7 has optimized its type converter system, which can impact 3rd party components which has type converters.
Previously the type converter system would attempt to find a type converter that would be capable of
converting between two given types (also by walking up the parent classes and super interfaces).
But this leads to slower performance, and Camel now relies on there being converter methods with the exact combo
of converting from/to types.

==== Converting to milli seconds from text

When converting to milli seconds using the shorthands for time precision with hours, minutes and seconds, then support
for fractions is no longer supported. For example `delay=0.5m` (half minute) isn't supported instead use `delay=30s`.

Support for using unites as `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, and `millis` has been removed.
Units must now also be one of `d` for days, `h` for hours, `m` for minutes, `s` for seconds, and `ms` for millis (can be omitted).
So you can use `1h12m37s42ms` for 1 hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds and 42 milli seconds.

=== JMX

The MBeans for error handlers has been removed.

=== ProcessorFactory

If a custom `org.apache.camel.spi.ProcessorFactory` is in use, then the factory should extend the default implementation
`org.apache.camel.processor.DefaultProcessorFactory` and in the overridden methods, super should be called to let
the default implementation create the processor when custom processors is not created.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.TypedProcessorFactor` moved from `camel-base` JAR
to `org.apache.camel.support.TypedProcessorFactor` in the `camel-support` JAR.

=== AdviceWith

Advice routes moved the `adviceWith` method from `org.apache.camel.reifier.RouteReifier` to `org.apache.camel.builder.AdviceWith`.
Also `adviceWith` methods on `org.apache.camel.builder.AdviceWithRouteBuilder` is deprecated in favour
of using methods on `org.apache.camel.builder.AdviceWith`.

=== toD EIP

Support for using multiple languages in the toD EIP has been removed as it was a rare feature in use, and is causing some
problems for maintenance. toD uses simple language by default, but an alternative language can still be specified.

=== Components

The option `basicPropertyBinding` that was deprecated has been removed.

=== camel-couchbase

The original URI path has been changed, now the bucket part is simply a required option and it's not part of the URI anymore.

=== camel-file-watch

The event type header is no more an enum, but it is now the explicit event as a `String` value.

=== camel-leveldb

Component uses different serialization mechanism, which is not backwards compatible with the original one.
For full compatibility use camel-leveldb-legacy component. (legacy component will be removed in the future)

=== camel-mock

The class `InterceptSendToMockEndpointStrategy` in `camel-base` JAR is moved from `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.InterceptSendToMockEndpointStrategy`
to `org.apache.camel.component.mock.InterceptSendToMockEndpointStrategy` in the `camel-mock` JAR.

=== camel-saga

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.saga.InMemorySagaService` is moved to `org.apache.camel.saga.InMemorySagaService`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.saga.InMemorySagaCoordinator` is moved to `org.apache.camel.saga.InMemorySagaCoordinator`.

=== camel-management

The `listTypeConverters` operation on `ManagedTypeConverterRegistryMBean` has been removed.

=== camel-kafka

We changed some options naming because they were a bit misleading

- From kafkaHeaderDeserializer to headerDeserializer
- From kafkaHeaderSerializer to headerSerializer
- From keySerializerClass to keySerializer
- From serializerClass to valueSerializer

- GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME - "CamelGitAuthorName" - The commit Author name
- GIT_COMMIT_COMMITTER_NAME - "CamelGitCommiterName" - The commit committer name
- GIT_COMMIT_TIME - "CamelGitCommitTime" - The commit time

=== camel-salesforce

The default API version for camel-salesforce has been updated to 50.0. Older versions are still 
supported and can be set via the `apiVersion` component option. 

The `packages` option must be set if using the XML `format` option. This change is a result of 
adopting XStream's Security Framework.

CAMEL-15890 fixed a bug in which values for External Ids that contained spaces would have spaces converted to "+". This has been fixed. 
However, any such values that now have the plus sign in salesforce will no longer match as Camel will now preserve the space. Therefore
you may need to have a transformation that explicitly converts spaces to "+" if you need to preserve the old behavior.

=== camel-google-bigquery

The camel-google-bigquery component was updated to use the latest version of `google-cloud-bigquery`. Some features of `GoogleBigQueryConnectionFactory` are no longer supported.

It is no longer possible to provide a the service account private key as a String parameter to `GoogleBigQueryConnectionFactory`. Instead, you should use `setCredentialsFileLocation` to 
discover the private key from your credentials file. Or use the fallback mechanism for discovering credentials by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. Refer to the 
component documentation for more information.
