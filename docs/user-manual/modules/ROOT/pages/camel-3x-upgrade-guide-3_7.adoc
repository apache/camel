= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.6 to 3.7

=== Camel-Couchbase

The original URI path has been changed, now the bucket part is simply a required option and it's not part of the URI anymore.

=== Camel-File-Watch

The event type header is no more an enum, but it is now the explicit Event String.
