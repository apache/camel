= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.6 to 3.7

=== Modularized core

The core has been further modularized and is now split up into three new core modules

- camel-core-model
- camel-core-reifier
- camel-core-processor

This separates the route model from the runtime processors via the reifiers, by having the classes in their own modules.

=== API changes

The class `BreakpointSupport` has moved from `org/apache/camel/processor/interceptor/BreakpointSupport` to `org.apache.camel.support.BreakpointSupport`.

These internal classes has been moved to locations that better suit where other similar processors are located.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.validator.ProcessorValidator` moved to `org.apache.camel.processor.validator.ProcessorValidator`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.transformer.ProcessorTransformer` moved to `org.apache.camel.processor.transformer.ProcessorTransformer`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.transformer.DataFormatTransformer` moved to `org.apache.camel.processor.transformer.DataFormatTransformer`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.validator.ValidatorKey` moved to `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.ValidatorKey`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.transformer.TransformerKey` moved to `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.TransformerKey`.

And the class `org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExecutorServiceManager` is moved from `camel-core-engine` JAR to
`org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultExecutorServiceManager` in the `camel-base` JAR.

The class `org.apache.camel.processor.ConvertBodyProcessor` is moved
to `org.apache.camel.support.ConvertBodyProcessor` in the `camel-support` JAR.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultClaimCheckRepository` moved
to `org.apache.camel.processor.DefaultClaimCheckRepository` in the `camel-core-processor` JAR.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultProducerCache` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.DefaultProducerCache`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultConsumerCache` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.DefaultConsumerCache`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.EmptyProducerCache` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.EmptyProducerCache`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.ServicePool` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.ServicePool`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.ProducerServicePool` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.ProducerServicePool`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.PollingConsumerServicePool` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.PollingConsumerServicePool`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.EventNotifierCallback` is moved to `org.apache.camel.support.cache.EventNotifierCallback`.

=== ProcessorFactory

If a custom `org.apache.camel.spi.ProcessorFactory` is in use, then the factory should extend the default implementation
`org.apache.camel.processor.DefaultProcessorFactory` and in the overridden methods, super should be called to let
the default implementation create the processor when custom processors is not created.

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.TypedProcessorFactor` moved from `camel-base` JAR
to `org.apache.camel.support.TypedProcessorFactor` in the `camel-support` JAR.

=== AdviceWith

Advice routes moved the `adviceWith` method from `org.apache.camel.reifier.RouteReifier` to `org.apache.camel.builder.AdviceWith`.
Also `adviceWith` methods on `org.apache.camel.builder.AdviceWithRouteBuilder` is deprecated in favour
of using methods on `org.apache.camel.builder.AdviceWith`.

=== toD EIP

Support for using multiple languages in the toD EIP has been removed as it was a rare feature in use, and is causing some
problems for maintenance. toD uses simple language by default, but an alternative language can still be specified.

=== camel-couchbase

The original URI path has been changed, now the bucket part is simply a required option and it's not part of the URI anymore.

=== camel-file-watch

The event type header is no more an enum, but it is now the explicit event as a `String` value.

=== camel-leveldb

Component uses different serialization mechanism, which is not backwards compatible with the original one.
For full compatibility use camel-leveldb-legacy component. (legacy component will be removed in the future)

=== camel-mock

The class `InterceptSendToMockEndpointStrategy` in `camel-base` JAR is moved from `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.InterceptSendToMockEndpointStrategy`
to `org.apache.camel.component.mock.InterceptSendToMockEndpointStrategy` in the `camel-mock` JAR.

=== camel-saga

The class `org.apache.camel.impl.saga.InMemorySagaService` is moved to `org.apache.camel.saga.InMemorySagaService`.
The class `org.apache.camel.impl.saga.InMemorySagaCoordinator` is moved to `org.apache.camel.saga.InMemorySagaCoordinator`.
