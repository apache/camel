= Using Exchange Pattern Annotations

Invoking InOut methods for ref:components:eips:requestReply-eip.adoc[request/reply] when working with xref:pojo-producing.adoc[POJO Producing] is typically synchronous. As such, the caller will block until the server returns a result.

[NOTE]
====
InOut means that there is an In message for  the input and an Out for the output/result.

[NOTE]
====
Other books, posts and reference guides may use the terms In/Out and In/Only for the patterns. In this guide we use InOut and InOnly respectively, as these are the names used within Camel.

You can also implement support for xref:components:eips:event-message.adoc[Event Messages] with Apache Camel, using the InOnly xref:exchange-pattern.adoc[pattern]. These are often called "fire and forget" (i.e., like sending a JMS message but not waiting for any response).

Since version 1.5 Camel supports annotations for specifying the message
exchange pattern on Java methods, classes or interfaces.

[[UsingExchangePatternAnnotations-SpecifyingInOnlymethods]]
== Specifying InOnly methods

Typically the InOut pattern is what most users want, but you can
customize to use InOnly using an annotation. For instance:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public interface Foo {
  Object someInOutMethod(String input);
  String anotherInOutMethod(Cheese input);
  
  @InOnly
  void someInOnlyMethod(Document input);
}
----

The above code shows three methods on an interface:
* the first two use the default InOut mechanism
* the third one, `someInOnlyMethod` uses the InOnly annotation to specify it as being a one-way method call.

[[UsingExchangePatternAnnotations-Classlevelannotations]]
== Class level annotations

You can also use class level annotations to default all methods in an
interface to a pattern:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
@InOnly
public interface Foo {
  void someInOnlyMethod(Document input);
  void anotherInOnlyMethod(String input);
}
----

Apache Camel will detect annotations on base classes or interfaces. For instance, suppose you created a client side proxy for the following code:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public class MyFoo implements Foo {
  ...
}
----

In this case, the methods inherited from Foo would be InOnly.

[[UsingExchangePatternAnnotations-Overloadingaclasslevelannotation]]
== Overloading a class level annotation


You can overload a class level annotation on specific methods. Suppose you have a class or interface with many InOnly methods, but you want to annote just one or two methods as InOut. You can do it like this:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
@InOnly
public interface Foo {
  void someInOnlyMethod(Document input);
  void anotherInOnlyMethod(String input);
  
  @InOut
  String someInOutMethod(String input); 
}
----

In the above `Foo` interface the only the `someInOutMethod` will be InOut.

[[UsingExchangePatternAnnotations-Usingyourownannotations]]
== Using your own annotations

You might want to create your own annotations to represent a group of
different bits of metadata; such as combining synchrony, concurrency and
transaction behaviour.

In this case you can annotate your annotation with the `@Pattern` annotation to the default exchange pattern you wish to use.

For example, lets say we want to create our own annotation called
`@MyAsyncService`:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD})

// lets add the message exchange pattern to it
@Pattern(ExchangePattern.InOnly)

// lets add some other annotations - maybe transaction behaviour?

public @interface MyAsyncService {
}
----

Now we can use this annotation, and Camel will figure out the correct
exchange pattern.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public interface Foo {
  void someInOnlyMethod(Document input);
  void anotherInOnlyMethod(String input);
  
  @MyAsyncService
  String someInOutMethod(String input); 
}
----
