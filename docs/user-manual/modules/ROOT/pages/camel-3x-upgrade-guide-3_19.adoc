= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.18 to 3.19

=== camel-api

Added `addClassLoader` method to `org.apache.camel.spi.ClassResolver`.

The default TLS protocol is changed from `TLSv1.2` to `TLSv1.3` in Camel JSSE support.

=== camel-management

The context MBean (`ManagedCamelContextMBean`) total counter is changed to count only once
while an _exchange_ is being routed through multiple routes. Previously the counter was
a total aggregation of all the routes the _exchange_ was processed. For example if an _exchange_
is routed via A, B and C; then previously the total counter was +3 (+1 for route A, +1 for route B, +1 for route C).
This is now corrected so the total is +1 on the context MBean.

=== camel-main

The option `camel.main.eager-classloading` has been removed.

=== camel-ftp

The default TLS protocol is changed from `TLSv1.2` to `TLSv1.3`.

=== camel-kafka

Updated the documentation to reflect the default TLS protocol in Kafka Clients running on JDK11+
is `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3` (prefer v1.3 but can fall back to v1.2).

=== camel-netty / camel-netty-http

The default TLS protocol is changed from `TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2` to `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3`.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

Removed using `template` as a custom alias for `routeTemplate` or `route-template`.

Removed the `tod` custom alias for `toD` or `to-d`.

A route template can now also define a `route` which allows specifying route
options that otherwise is not possible when using `from`.

For example, you can now disable stream-caching, as shown in the snippet below that are from a Kamelet:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  template:
    route:
      stream-caching: false
      message-history: true
      from:
        uri: timer:tick
        parameters:
          period: "{{period}}"
        steps:
          - set-body:
              constant: "{{message}}"
          - set-header:
              name: "Content-Type"
              constant: "{{contentType}}"
          - to: kamelet:sink
----

=== camel-salesforce

The URI format for consumer operations has changed. All consumer URIs now use the `subscribe` operation. E.g., `salesforce:subscribe:<topic_name>`, `salesforce:subscribe:event/<event_name>`, `salesforce:subscribe:data/ChangeEvents`.

=== camel-consul

The deprecated options were removed and should be replaced by the following options:

|===
|Deprecated |Replace with

|`connectTimeoutMillis`
|`connectTimeout`

|`readTimeoutMillis`
|`readTimeout`

|`writeTimeoutMillis`
|`writeTimeout`
|===

=== camel-google-bigquery-sql

Parameters in form of `@name` are extracted from the body or message and their type is preserved and translated into corresponding `com.google.cloud.bigquery.StandardSQLTypeName`. See the https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery/latest/com.google.cloud.bigquery.QueryParameterValue[documentation] for more information. (Conversion to StandardSQLTypeName.STRING was used for each type before)


=== camel-telegram

The component was migrated from the Async HTTP Client to the builtin HTTP client from Java 11 and newer. As such,
* the parameter `clientConfig`, that received an `AsyncHTTPClientConfiguration` instance was removed
* the parameter `client`, that received an `AsyncHttpClient` instance, was modified to receive a HTTPClient instance.


=== xtokenize language

The xtokenize language has moved from `camel-xml-jaxp` to `camel-stax` JAR because
a stax parser was needed anyway to use the language.


=== camel-karaf

Upgraded from Karaf 4.3.x to Karaf 4.4.x, which requires JDK11+.

=== Deprecated Components

The following components that had been marked as deprecated, were removed in this release:

* camel-ahc
* camel-ahc-ws
