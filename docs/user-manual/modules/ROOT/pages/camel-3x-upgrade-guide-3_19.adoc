= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.18 to 3.19

=== camel-api

Added `addClassLoader` method to `org.apache.camel.spi.ClassResolver`.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

Removed using `template` as a custom alias for `routeTemplate` or `route-template`.

Removed the `tod` custom alias for `toD` or `to-d`.

=== camel-salesforce

The URI format for consumer operations has changed. All consumer URIs now use the `subscribe` operation. E.g., `salesforce:subscribe:<topic_name>`, `salesforce:subscribe:event/<event_name>`, `salesforce:subscribe:data/ChangeEvents`.
