= Startup Condition

*Available as of Camel 4.9*

You can use `StartupCondition` to let Camel perform some checks on startup,
before continuing. For example to check if a specific ENV exists, or wait
for a specific file to be created etc.

Camel provides a few out of the box

- `EnvStartupCondition` - To check for a specific OS environment exists
- `FileStartupCondition` - To check for a specific file exists

You can implement custom conditions by implementing `org.apache.camel.spi.StartupCondition`,
and add these to the `StartupConditionStrategy` or `Registry` such as:

[source,java]
----
StartupConditionStrategy scs = context.getCamelContextExtension().getContextPlugin(StartupConditionStrategy.class);
scs.addStartupCondition(new MyCondition());
----

If you use Camel Main, Spring Boot, or Quarkus, you can configure startup conditions with configuration in `application.properties`.

For example to check for a specific OS environment variable exists:

[source,properties]
----
camel.startupcondition.enabled = true
camel.startupcondition.environmentVariableExists = FOO_BAR
----

Or to use a custom condition by its class name:

[source,properties]
----
camel.startupcondition.enabled = true
camel.startupcondition.customClassNames = com.foo.MyStartupCondition
----
