[[TransactionErrorHandler-TransactionErrorHandler]]
=== TransactionErrorHandler

*Available as of Camel 2.0*

This is the new default transaction error handler in Camel 2.0 onwards,
used for transacted routes.

It uses the same base as the
link:defaulterrorhandler.adoc[DefaultErrorHandler] so it has the same
feature set as this error handler.

By default any exception thrown during routing will be propagated back
to the caller and the link:exchange.adoc[Exchange] ends immediately.
However you can use the link:exception-clause.adoc[Exception Clause] to
catch a given exception and lower the exception by marking it as
handled. If so the exception will *not* be sent back to the caller and
the link:exchange.adoc[Exchange] continues to be routed.

[[TransactionErrorHandler-Example]]
==== Example

In this route below, any exception thrown in eg the `validateOrder` bean
will be propagated back to the caller, and its the jetty endpoint. It
will return a HTTP error message back to the client.

[source,java]
----
from("jetty:http://localhost/myservice/order").transacted().to("bean:validateOrder").to("jms:queue:order");
----

We can add a *onException* in case we want to catch certain exceptions
and route them differently, for instance to catch a
*ValidationException* and return a fixed response to the caller.

[source,java]
----
onException(ValidationException.class).handled(true).transform(body(constant("INVALID ORDER")));

from("jetty:http://localhost/myservice/order").transacted().to("bean:validateOrder").to("jms:queue:order");
----

When the *ValidationException* is thrown from the validate order bean it
is intercepted by the
link:transactionerrorhandler.adoc[TransactionErrorHandler] and it let
the `onException(ValidationException.class` handle it so the
link:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is routed to this route and since we use
*handled(true)* then the original exception is lowered (= cleared) and
we transform the message into a fixed response that are returned to
jetty endpoint that returns it to the original caller.

[[TransactionErrorHandler-Conventionoverconfiguration]]
==== Convention over configuration

When you configure a route to be transacted you just mark it as
transacted as follows:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:queue:foo").transacted().to("bean:handleFoo");
----

And in Spring DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
   <from uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
   <transacted/>
   <to uri="bean:handleFoo"/>
</route>
----

What happens is that Camel will automatic lookup the right Spring
transaction manager. It does using the following rules, in order: +
1. If there is only 1 bean with the type
`org.apache.camel.spi.TransactedPolicy` then its used. +
2. If there is a bean with id `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` and of type
`org.apache.camel.spi.TransactedPolicy` then its used. +
3. If there is only 1 bean with the type
`org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager` then its
used.

However you can explicit configure what you want to use. For instance
the *transacted* DSL accepts a String reference parameter to indicate
the bean id of the `org.apache.camel.spi.TransactedPolicy` bean to use
in case you have multiple beans. For instance a PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW
bean.

The *transactionErrorHandler* like the *transacted* also supprts
convention over configuration and it will also automatic lookup the
right Spring transaction manager. It does using the following rules, in
order: +
1. If there is only 1 bean with the type
`org.apache.camel.spi.TransactedPolicy` then its used. +
2. If there is a bean with id `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` and of type
`org.apache.camel.spi.TransactedPolicy` then its used. +
3. If there is only 1 bean with the type
`org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionTemplate` then its
used. +
4. If there is only 1 bean with the type
`org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager` then its
used.

However you can explicit configure what you want to use. For instance
the *transactionErrorHandler* DSL accepts either a TransactedPolicy, a
TransactionTemplate or a PlatformTransactionManager.

[[TransactionErrorHandler-UsingCameltodoredeliveries]]
==== Using Camel to do redeliveries

As the link:transactionerrorhandler.adoc[TransactionErrorHandler] also
supports to let Camel do redeliveries you can use both worlds. Letting
Camel do some redeliveries and at the end the backing transaction
manager doing other redeliveries. In fact in the end the transaction
manager have the final word. That means if Camel cannot process the
exchange then its thrown back to the transaction manager that will
perform the rollback, and redelivery.

[[TransactionErrorHandler-ExamplewithusingCameltodoredeliveries]]
===== Example with using Camel to do redeliveries

In the route below we have configured a transaction error handler. It
will by default do local redeliveries up till 6 times. In Case Camel
could not redeliver the message it will be thrown back to the
transaction manager that will do a rollback, and a redelivery if it was
configured to do so.

Notice that as we have all the powers from
link:defaulterrorhandler.adoc[DefaultErrorHandler] we can configure an
*onException* where we state that in case of this particular exception,
an IllegalArgumentException we will only do redeliveries up till 4
times. (Yes the code is based on an unit test).

And also notice that we mark the routes as transacted using
*transacted*. This is always needed to instruct Camel that these routes
are transacted.

If you do not provide any Spring TransactionTemplate to either the
*transactionErrorHandler*, then Camel will automatic lookup in the
Spring application context for a transaction manager to use. See more in
the Convention over configuration section on this page.

And now the route:

[source,java]
----
// configure transacted error handler to use up till 4 redeliveries
// we have not passed in any spring TX manager. Camel will automatic
// find it in the spring application context. You only need to help
// Camel in case you have multiple TX managers
errorHandler(transactionErrorHandler().maximumRedeliveries(6));

// speical for this exception we only want to do it at most 4 times
onException(IllegalArgumentException.class).maximumRedeliveries(4);

from("direct:okay")
    // marks this route as transacted, and we dont pass in any parameters so we
    // will auto lookup and use the Policy defined in the spring XML file
    .transacted()
    .setBody(constant("Tiger in Action")).bean("bookService")
    .setBody(constant("Elephant in Action")).bean("bookService");

// marks this route as transacted that will use the single policy defined in the registry
from("direct:fail")
    // marks this route as transacted, and we dont pass in any parameters so we
    // will auto lookup and use the Policy defined in the spring XML file
    .transacted()
    .setBody(constant("Tiger in Action")).bean("bookService")
    .setBody(constant("Donkey in Action")).bean("bookService");
