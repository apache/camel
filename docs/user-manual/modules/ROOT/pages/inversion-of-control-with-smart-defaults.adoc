Inversion Of Control With Smart Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inversion of Control is a powerful way of wiring together your beans so
that the beans themselves can stay simple & be injected with their
dependencies by their IoC container. One of the downsides of wring
everything together using an IoC container like Spring is that you can
often en up with huge amounts of XML configuring everything.

The Inversion Of Control With Smart Defaults pattern attempts to address
this by providing in-built smart defaults into the system so that you
only have to actually configure things which are not the default
behavior.

For example with Camel you can configure a
CamelContext; capable of creating on demand
Component and Endpoint
instances along with providing a powerful link:type-converter.html[Type
Converter] registry all by using a single XML element...

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
</camelContext>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you explicitly want to configure the context; a component, an
endpoint or dependent objects explicitly in XML you can; but all the
common defaults are wired together for you.
