= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.7 to 3.8

=== Route startup procedure change

Camel will now initialize all routes during initialization of `CamelContext` itself.
Before all routes where lazy initialized when they were started, which happens in the starting phase of `CamelContext`.
But moving this forward to initialization phase, then we ensure all is done together.

This means that all the resources used in the routes such as EIPs, processors, beans, components, data formats, languages etc.
are also initialized. An affect of this change is that any custom Camel component that may do initialization logic in
the constructors of `Consumer` or `Producer` should *not* do this, but move this logic to `doInit` or `doStart` where
such logic correctly belongs.

=== Restart CamelContext

It is no longer possible to start `CamelContext` after it has been stopped. To restart a context, then use suspend/resume.
The `restart` JMX operation on `CamelContextMBean` has been removed from `camel-management`.

=== API changes

The following type names are renamed in `CamelEvent.Type` enum:

- `CamelContextRoutesStarting` to `RoutesStarting`
- `CamelContextRoutesStarted` to `RoutesStarted`
- `CamelContextRoutesStopping` to `RoutesStopping`
- `CamelContextRoutesStopped` to `RoutesStopped`

The method `isOnlyDynamicQueryParameters` is removed from `org.apache.camel.spi.SendDynamicAware` and
`org.apache.camel.support.component.SendDynamicAwareSupport` classes.

The `PackageScanResourceResolver` has been revisited and `findResources`` now returns a colelctions of `org.apache.camel.spi.Resource` which provide both the location of the resolved resources an a method to open the related InpuStream:

[source,java]
----
Collection<Resource> findResources(String location) throws Exception;
----

=== OnCompletion EIP

The `onCompletion` EIP has fixed it could trigger multiple completions for a given `Exchange`

=== Transactions and Multicast, Splitter, or Recipient List EIPs

When using `transacted` in Camel routes with Multicast, Splitter, or Recipient List EIPs, then the exection strackframe
may grown deep and could cause Stack overflow exception. This has been fixed by refactoring the EIP into a special
transacted mode and the existing reactive mode.

We do not anticipate any issues but if you are using transactions and these EIPs then we would like to have feedback
if you encounter any problems with upgrading.

=== camel-jackson

When using XML DSL then `jsonView` has been renamed to `jsonViewTypeName` and made general available in the model,
and for the lightweight `camel-xml-io` route parser.

=== camel-caffeine-lrucache

This LRUCache implementation is using an algorithm where elements that are removed may not be in strict order, and therefore
not ideal for LRU caches assuming ordering.

The need for this implementation is not needed anymore in Camel 3, as we are using a simpler default implementation internally.
This component is deprecated, and has been removed as Maven dependency in `camel-core` pom.xml file.

=== camel-infinispan

The infinispan component has been splitup into client and embedded server mode.
The module `camel-infinispan` is the client mode, and `camel-infinispan-embedded` is for server mode.
Most use cases would be client mode to integrate with an existing Infinispan cluster, and hence why it was choosen
to be the `camel-infinispan` component.

=== camel-activemq and camel-jms

The JMS and ActiveMQ component now supports optimized toD EIP pattern by using a single endpoint/producer for dynamic destination names.

=== camel-sjms and camel-sjms2

These two components has been overhauled and re-written with the goals of being more feature complete with the Spring JMS component.
They also no longer uses their own connection pooling, but let you use the existing 3rd party pooling for `ConnectionFactory` which is common practice.
The components are now also reactive and non-blocking, and also supports optimized toD EIP pattern by using a single endpoint/producer for dynamic destination names.

Many of the previous features and configuration options have been removed/renamed.
To migrate you need to read their documentation and see what options they now offer.

=== Camel-AWS2-SNS

The policy option now expects a file, since the policy are going to be complex. It can be from classpath:, http: or file: etc.

=== Camel-AWS2-SQS

The policy option now expects a file, since the policy are going to be complex. It can be from classpath:, http: or file: etc.

=== Camel-Github

The Camel Github Commit consumer has been changed a bit.

For each exchange now in the body you'll get the commit full message as a String and not the Commit Object like before.

Other information has been stored in headers declared in GitHubConstants class:

* GITHUB_COMMIT_AUTHOR - "CamelGitHubCommitAuthor" - The commit Author
* GITHUB_COMMIT_COMMITTER - "CamelGitHubCommitCommitter" - The committer name
* GITHUB_COMMIT_SHA - "CamelGitHubCommitSha" - The commit sha
* GITHUB_COMMIT_URL - "CamelGitHubCommitUrl" - The commit url

The Camel Github Events consumer has been changed a bit.

For each exchange now in the body you'll get the event type as a String and not the Event Object like before.

Other information has been stored in headers declared in GitHubConstants class:

* GITHUB_EVENT_PAYLOAD - "CamelGitHubEventPayload" - The event payload

=== Camel-infinispan

There are now two components for Infinispan:

- *camel-infinispan* to integrate with remote caches through the Hot Rod protocol (scheme: *infinispan*).
- *camel-infinispan-embedded* to integrate with local/embedded caches  (scheme: *infinispan-embedded*).

As conseguence of the refactor

- the remote and embedded endpoints provide support the same capabilities, as example queries were only possible on a remote cache and now they are suported on both remote and local/embedded caches
- the configuration options for the endpoint are now specific to the context which remove the possibility to mix unrelated propertis
- some classes have been relocated, as example, indempotent and aggregation repositories have been moved from `org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.processor.*` to `org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.embedded` or `org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.remote`:
+
org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.embedded.InfinispanEmbeddedAggregationRepository
org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.embedded.InfinispanEmbeddedIdempotentRepository
org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.remote.InfinispanRemoteAggregationRepository
org.apache.camel.component.infinispan.remote.InfinispanRemoteIdempotentRepository

=== Camel-AWS

All the camel-aws components except camel-aws-xray have been deprecated. We suggest to migrate to Camel-AWS2-* components, because in future releases the AWS components will be removed and with the next LTS release (3.10 probably) camel-aws2 components will be renamed to camel-aws.
