=== Batch Consumer

*Available as of Camel 2.0*

Batch Consumer is basically a xref:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumer] that is capable of polling multiple
Exchanges in a pool. What we have done in Camel 2.0
is to standardize this into a `org.apache.camel.BatchConsumer` interface
that a consumer can implement to indicate it support batching as well.

Consumer] by its consumer:
