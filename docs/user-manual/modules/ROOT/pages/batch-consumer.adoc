[[BatchConsumer-BatchConsumer]]
= Batch Consumer

*Since Camel 2.0*

Batch Consumer is basically a xref:{eip-vc}:eips:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumer] that is capable of polling multiple
Exchanges in a pool. What we have done in Camel 2.0
is to standardize this into a `org.apache.camel.BatchConsumer` interface
that a consumer can implement to indicate it support batching as well.

The following components supports xref:batch-consumer.adoc[Batch
Consumer] by its consumer:

* xref:components::atom-component.adoc[Atom]
* File
* FTP
* xref:components::hbase-component.adoc[hbase]
* xref:components::jpa-component.adoc[JPA]
* xref:components::jclouds-component.adoc[JCLOUDS]
* xref:components::mail-component.adoc[Mail]
* xref:components::mybatis-component.adoc[MyBatis]
* xref:components::snmp-component.adoc[SNMP]
* xref:components::sql-component.adoc[SQL]
* xref:components::aws-sqs-component.adoc[SQS]
* xref:components::aws-s3-component.adoc[S3]
