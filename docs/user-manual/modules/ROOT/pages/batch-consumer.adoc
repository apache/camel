= Batch Consumer

Batch Consumer is basically a xref:components:eips:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumer] that is capable of polling multiple
Exchanges in a single pool.

To support batching the consumer must implement the `org.apache.camel.BatchConsumer` interface.

A range of Camel components support batching such as:

* xref:components::aws2-ddb-component.adoc[AWS2 DDB]
* xref:components::aws2-kinesis-component.adoc[AWS2 Kinesis]
* xref:components::aws2-s3-component.adoc[AWS2 S3]
* xref:components::aws2-sqs-component.adoc[AWS2 SQS]
* xref:components::file-component.adoc[File]
* xref:components::ftp-component.adoc[FTP]
* xref:components::ironmq-component.adoc[IronMQ]
* xref:components::jooq-component.adoc[Jooq]
* xref:components::jpa-component.adoc[JPA]
* xref:components::mail-component.adoc[Mail]
* xref:components::minio-component.adoc[Minio]
* xref:components::mybatis-component.adoc[MyBatis]
* xref:components::slack-component.adoc[Slack]
* xref:components::splunk-component.adoc[Splunk]
* xref:components::sql-component.adoc[SQL]

== Options

The `BatchConsumer` supports the following options:

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description
|`maxMessagesPerPoll` |An integer to define a maximum messages to gather per poll. By default,
no maximum is set. Can be used to set a limit of e.g. 1000 to avoid when
starting up the server that there are thousands of files. Set a value of
0 or negative to disabled it as unlimited.
|=======================================================================

Very often a `BatchConsumer` is scheduled and is based of the `ScheduledBatchPollingConsumer`
that has many options for configuring the scheduling. These options are listed with _(scheduler)_
as label in the endpoints options in the xref:components::index.adoc[Components] documentation.

== Exchange Properties

The following properties is set on the Exchange for
each Exchange polled in the same batch.

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]

|Property |Description
|`CamelBatchSize` |The total number of Exchanges that was polled in this batch.
|`CamelBatchIndex` |The current index of the batch. Starts from 0.
|`CamelBatchComplete` |A boolean indicating the last Exchange in the batch.
