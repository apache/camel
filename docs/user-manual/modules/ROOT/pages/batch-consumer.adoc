[[BatchConsumer-BatchConsumer]]
= Batch Consumer

Batch Consumer is basically a xref:{eip-vc}:eips:polling-consumer.adoc[Polling
Consumer] that is capable of polling multiple
Exchanges in a single pool.

To support batching the consumer must implement the `org.apache.camel.BatchConsumer` interface.

A range of Camel components support batching such as:

* xref:components::file-component.adoc[File]
* xref:components::ftp-component.adoc[FTP]
* xref:components::jpa-component.adoc[JPA]
* xref:components::mail-component.adoc[Mail]
* xref:components::mybatis-component.adoc[MyBatis]
* xref:components::snmp-component.adoc[SNMP]
* xref:components::sql-component.adoc[SQL]

Very often a `BatchConsumer` is scheduled and is based of the `ScheduledBatchPollingConsumer`
