= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.16 to 3.17

=== camel-core

==== Stream Caching

We have enabled xref:stream-caching.adoc[Stream Caching] by default on `CamelContext`. The reason is that Camel users
may often hit this problem without knowing what is causing this, and blaming it on Apache Camel.

This means that Camel would automatically cache message bodies that are based on `java.util.InputStream`
such as often seen with HTTP components. This makes it safe to log the message body, and elsewhere.

The cost is a tiny overhead in the routing engine as Camel will automatic type convert
to `StreamCache` if needed. Users can turn this off:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.setStreamCaching(false);
----

Or via Camel Main / Camel K / Quarkus:

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.streamCachingEnabled=false
----

Or in Spring Boot

[source,properties]
----
camel.springboot.streamCachingEnabled=false
----

And in legacy Spring XML or OSGi Blueprint:

[source,xml]
----
<streamCaching enabled="true" .../>
----

We also changed the default settings for stream caching to not spool to disk, meaning that the cache
is an in-memory on cache.

To enable spool to disk, you can configure this as follows:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.getStreamCachingStrategy().setSpoolEnabled(true);
----

Or via Camel Main / Camel K / Quarkus:

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.streamCachingSpoolEnabled=true
----

Or in Spring Boot

[source,properties]
----
camel.springboot.streamCachingSpoolEnabled=true
----

And in legacy Spring XML or OSGi Blueprint:

[source,xml]
----
<streamCaching spoolEnabled="true" .../>
----

=== camel-health

Camel now reports DOWN when Camel is being stopped, during the graceful shutdown process.
This ensures that Camel reports that it's not ready to accept new traffic.

=== camel-main

Added method `findRouteResourcesFromDirectory` to `org.apache.camel.main.RoutesCollector`.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

Removed deprecated `spec/flows` and `spec/flow` from the kamelet yaml loader.
Must use `spec/template` as key for the kamelet template.

Removed _endpoint-dsl_ notation which was not well known,
causing problems for tools, and yaml-validation against the json-schema standard.

For example the following notation:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "direct:start"
    steps:
      - to:
          kafka:
            topic: cheese
            brokers: mykafka:1234
----

Should be change to:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "direct:start"
    steps:
      - to:
          uri: "kafka:cheese?brokers=mykafka:1234"
----

Or

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "direct:start"
    steps:
      - to:
          uri: "kafka"
          parameters:
            topic: "cheese"
            brokers: "mykafka:1234"
----

=== camel-spring-xml / camel-blueprint

The error handling has been made universal and exposed generally in the `camel-core-model`
with intent to align error handling across DSLs.

However, the XML DSL for Spring `<beans>` and OSGi blueprint is legacy, and they
have their own special XML parsing and error handling.

This means the model classes has been renamed, which only affect Camel end users whom
has defined error handling as `<bean>` in Spring or Blueprint XML files:

- `org.apache.camel.builder.DeadLetterChannelBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.builder.LegacyDeadLetterChannelBuilder`
- `org.apache.camel.builder.DefaultErrorHandlerBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.builder.LegacyDefaultErrorHandlerBuilder`
- `org.apache.camel.builder.NoErrorHandlerBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.builder.LegacyNoErrorHandlerBuilder`
- `org.apache.camel.spring.spi.TransactionErrorHandlerBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.spring.spi.LegacyTransactionErrorHandlerBuilder`

Users who has been configured error handling using `<errorHandler>` in Spring or Blueprint XML files should not be affected.

=== camel-cdi / camel-cdi-jta

The class `org.apache.camel.cdi.CdiRouteBuilder` has been removed as you can use `jtaTransactionErrorHandler` builder
methods from `camel-core` instead.

The class `org.apache.canel.jta.JtaTransactionErrorHandlerBuilder` has been removed, as the JTA error handler builder
can be used with the `jtaTransactionErrorHandler` from `camel-core-model`.

=== camel-kafka

The option `autoCommitOnStop` was removed from the Camel Kafka component. When using `autoCommitEnable` (which is enabled by default) the Kafka consumer will automatically commit on close.

When the `autoCommitEnable` is turned off, the component issues a call to the respective commit manager during shutdown.

Asynchronous, Synchronous or NO-OP commit policies from the former `autoCommitOnStop` are now determined by automatically by the value of the `kafkaManualCommitFactory` option:

* NO-OP is the default behavior if no `kafkaManualCommitFactory` is provided
* Async can be set using `kafkaManualCommitFactory=#class:org.apache.camel.component.kafka.consumer.DefaultKafkaManualAsyncCommitFactory`
* Sync can be set using `kafkaManualCommitFactory=#class:org.apache.camel.component.kafka.consumer.DefaultKafkaManualCommitFactory`

The deprecated constructors for the kafkaManualCommitFactory have been removed. The constructor should now receive the following parameters:

[source,java]
----
CamelExchangePayload camelExchangePayload, KafkaRecordPayload kafkaRecordPayload, CommitManager commitManager
----

=== camel-platform-http-vertx

The configuration for body handler file uploads has changed from `true` to `false`.
The configuration can be enabled via the `VertxPlatformHttpServerConfiguration` class.

=== camel-opentracing / camel-opentelemetry

We aligned the MDC keys with OpenTelemetry, so they are changed from:

- `traceId` -> `trace_id`
- `spanId` -> `span_id`

=== camel-atom

This component was refactored to support the Resume API v2. As such, the options `filter` and `lastUpdate` where removed.

[source,java]
----
from("atom:file:src/test/data/feed.atom?splitEntries=true&delay=500")
    .resumable().resumeStrategy(new UpdatedDateFilter(new Date()))
    .to("mock:result");
----

More complex filters can be implemented by extending the `UpdatedDateFilter` or by implementing a new `EntryFilter` resume strategy.

=== camel-cdi

The support for the Camel XML configuration import, that had been marked as deprecated in previous releases, was removed.

=== camel-cxf-blueprint

When using OSGi Blueprint with CXF endpoints defined in their own namespace as below,
then you must use `depends-on` to refer to the ID of the `<camelContext>`.

Notice how we must use `depends-on="VerySimple-context"` in the `cxf:cxfEndpoint` to refer to the `CamelContext`.

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<osgi:blueprint xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                xmlns:camel="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint"
                xmlns:osgi="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"
                xmlns:cxf="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint/cxf">

		<cxf:properties>
			<osgi:entry key="dataFormat" value="PAYLOAD"/>
		</cxf:properties>
	</cxf:cxfEndpoint>

</osgi:blueprint>
----

=== camel-sftp

The underlying JSch library has been updated (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-17835[CAMEL-17835]) to a
more secure and actively maintained fork which has removed key types and algorithms that rely on SHA1. For
information on how these can be restored, consult the xref:components::sftp-component.adoc[SFTP component] documentation.

=== camel-rabbitmq

When using `skipQueueDeclare=true` you now must also set `skipQueueBind=true` to skip both declaring and binding the queue.

=== Deprecated Components

The following components that had been marked as deprecated, were removed in this release:

* camel-atomix
* camel-beanstalk
* camel-beanio
* camel-etcd
* camel-elsql
* camel-ganglia
* camel-nsq
* camel-hystrix
* camel-jing
* camel-leveldb-legacy
