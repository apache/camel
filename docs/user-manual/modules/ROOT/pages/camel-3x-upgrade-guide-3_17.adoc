= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.16 to 3.17

=== camel-health

Camel now reports DOWN when Camel is being stopped, during the graceful shutdown process.
This ensures that Camel reports that it's not ready to accept new traffic.

=== camel-main

Added method `findRouteResourcesFromDirectory` to `org.apache.camel.main.RoutesCollector`.

=== camel-yaml-dsl

Removed _endpoint-dsl_ notation which was not well known,
causing problems for tools, and yaml-validation against the json-schema standard.

For example the following notation:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "direct:start"
    steps:
      - to:
          kafka:
            topic: cheese
            brokers: mykafka:1234
----

Should be change to:

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "direct:start"
    steps:
      - to:
          uri: "kafka:cheese?brokers=mykafka:1234"
----

Or

[source,yaml]
----
- from:
    uri: "direct:start"
    steps:
      - to:
          uri: "kafka"
          parameters:
            topic: "cheese"
            brokers: "mykafka:1234"
----

=== camel-spring-xml / camel-blueprint

The error handling has been made universal and exposed generally in the `camel-core-model`
with intent to align error handling across DSLs.

However, the XML DSL for Spring `<beans>` and OSGi blueprint is legacy, and they
have their own special XML parsing and error handling.

This means the model classes has been renamed, which only affect Camel end users whom
has defined error handling as `<bean>` in Spring or Blueprint XML files:

- `org.apache.camel.builder.DeadLetterChannelBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.builder.LegacyDeadLetterChannelBuilder`
- `org.apache.camel.builder.DefaultErrorHandlerBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.builder.LegacyDefaultErrorHandlerBuilder`
- `org.apache.camel.builder.NoErrorHandlerBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.builder.LegacyNoErrorHandlerBuilder`
- `org.apache.camel.spring.spi.TransactionErrorHandlerBuilder` to `org.apache.camel.spring.spi.LegacyTransactionErrorHandlerBuilder`

Users who has been configured error handling using `<errorHandler>` in Spring or Blueprint XML files should not be affected.

=== camel-cdi / camel-cdi-jta

The class `org.apache.camel.cdi.CdiRouteBuilder` has been removed as you can use `jtaTransactionErrorHandler` builder
methods from `camel-core` instead.

The class `org.apache.canel.jta.JtaTransactionErrorHandlerBuilder` has been removed, as the JTA error handler builder
can be used with the `jtaTransactionErrorHandler` from `camel-core-model`.

=== camel-kafka

The option `autoCommitOnStop` was removed from the Camel Kafka component. When using `autoCommitEnable` (which is enabled by default) the Kafka consumer will automatically commit on close.

When the `autoCommitEnable` is turned off, the component issues a call to the respective commit manager during shutdown.

Asynchronous, Synchronous or NO-OP commit policies from the former `autoCommitOnStop` are now determined by automatically by the value of the `kafkaManualCommitFactory` option:

* NO-OP is the default behavior if no `kafkaManualCommitFactory` is provided
* Async can be set using `kafkaManualCommitFactory=#class:org.apache.camel.component.kafka.consumer.DefaultKafkaManualAsyncCommitFactory`
* Sync can be set using `kafkaManualCommitFactory=#class:org.apache.camel.component.kafka.consumer.DefaultKafkaManualCommitFactory`

=== camel-platform-http-vertx

The configuration for body handler file uploads has changed from `true` to `false`.
The configuration can be enabled via the `VertxPlatformHttpServerConfiguration` class.

=== camel-atom

This component was refactored to support the Resume API v2. As such, the options `filter` and `lastUpdate` where removed.

```
from("atom:file:src/test/data/feed.atom?splitEntries=true&delay=500")
    .resumable().resumeStrategy(new UpdatedDateFilter(new Date()))
    .to("mock:result");
```

More complex filters can be implemented by extending the `UpdatedDateFilter` or by implementing a new `EntryFilter` resume strategy.

=== camel-cdi

The support for the Camel XML configuration import, that had been marked as deprecated in previous releases, was removed.

=== Deprecated Components

The following components that had been marked as deprecated, were removed in this release:

* camel-atomix
* camel-beanstalk
* camel-beanio
* camel-etcd
* camel-elsql
* camel-ganglia
* camel-nsq
* camel-hystrix
* camel-jing
* camel-leveldb-legacy
* camel-msv
* camel-nagios
* camel-ribbon
* camel-sip
* camel-soroush
* camel-tagsoup
* camel-yammer
