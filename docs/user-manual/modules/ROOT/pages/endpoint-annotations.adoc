= Component Endpoint Annotations

You can annotate xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint] and xref:component.adoc[Component]
classes, so that their configuration documentation can be
automatically generated by Maven tooling via the `camel-component-maven-plugin` plugin,
into the `src/main/generated` folder.

The documentation is then included into the jar as JSON schema files.

The Camel project uses this to automatic keep the website documentation up-to-date
with all the latest options on the Camel xref:components::index.adoc[Components].

== Supported Annotations

|=======================================================================
|Annotation |Description
|`@UriEndpoint` |Specifies that an endpoint is annotated with `@UriParam`
and/or `@UriParams` annotations. Also specifies the default scheme to use
in the generated documentation, and other informations.

|`@UriParam` |Used to annotate a parameter value; usually specified via
?foo=bar syntax in the URI strings in Camel. Used currently only on
field declarations but in the future could be used on setter methods
too. If no name is specified then the name of the field/setter property
is used.

|`@UriParams` |Specifies that a field is a nested object of one or more
configuration parameters; then the class of this field should be
annotated with one or more `@UriParam` or `@UriParams` annotations

|`@Metadata` | Used for special situations to provide additional information.
|=======================================================================

For example see the `TimerEndpoint` from the `camel-timer` component and
notice how it is using these annotations.

Not only are the annotations useful for automatically generating the
documentation; we can use them to refine the validation of the code
during configuration and can be useful for tooling providers, so they
can more easily introspect the configuration options.
