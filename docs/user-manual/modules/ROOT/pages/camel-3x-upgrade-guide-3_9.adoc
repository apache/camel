= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.8 to 3.9

=== Modularized camel-spring

The `camel-spring` component has been modularized into:

- `camel-spring` - Core module for Camel Spring support
- `camel-spring-xml` - XML DSL when using Spring XML (eg `<beans>`)

And also for Camel on Spring Boot:

- `camel-spring-boot-starter` - Camel with Spring Boot
- `camel-spring-boot-xml-starter` - XML DSL when using Spring XML (eg `<beans>`) with Spring Boot

The motivation is to move out the XML DSL from `camel-spring` which reduces the number of dependencies and makes
the module lighter.

Users that use the Spring XML DSL (eg the top XML tag is Spring `<beans>`) should migrate from using `camel-spring`
to `camel-spring-xml` as dependency.

Users that do not use Spring XML should not be affected.

In Spring XML `<proxy>` and <remote>` have been removed. They were only available in Spring XML
and not in the other XML DSLs (Blueprint and CDI).

=== camel-spring-boot-starter vs camel-spring-boot-engine-starter

Based on the modularization of camel-spring we have made two starters available when using Camel on Spring Boot

- camel-spring-boot-starter - The regular starter that includes all the core components (similar to camel-core)
- camel-spring-boot-engine-starter - A minimal starter with just Camel core engine (similar to camel-core-engine)

We also made all the component -starter JARs not depend on any of the above starters, which means you must pick
the one to use above, and then add which -starter JARs you want to use in your Camel spring boot applications.
