= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.8 to 3.9

=== API changes

The `Consumer` API in `camel-api` has been enhanced to help support Camel reducing the footprint during routing.
One aspect is that we allow to recycle `Exchange` instances created by the consumers. This avoids creating new `Exchange`
instances in the memory for each incoming message consumers process. By recycling `Exchange`s we reduce the overhead
on the JVM garbage collector. However this requires Camel to know whether or not the `Exchange` should be recycle or not,
and some API changes took place.

The `Consumer` API has two new methods which a consumer must use to create an `Exchange` with `createExchange`.
By default the exchange is auto released when its complete in use, but some consumers needs custom control,
and can turn off auto release, which then requires the consumer to manually release the exchange by calling `releaseExchange`
when the consumer is done with the exchange.

The default implementations in `DefaultConsumer` has adapted this API and 3rd party components can continue as is, by using
the older APIs. However for these 3rd party components to support recycling exchanges, then they must be updated to use this new API.

A new `org.apache.camel.spi.ResourceLoader` has been introduced as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-16285[CAMEL-16285] which provide a way to support additional schemas to resolve resources. As a conseguence:

- `org.apache.camel.support.ResourceHelper` has been updated to use such mechanism instead fo the old one.
- it is not more possible to provide support for additional schemas using the URL protocol handler mechanism but instead, custom schemas can be added by implementing `org.apache.camel.spi.ResourceResolver` and either bind an instance to the Camel Registry (using `resource-loader-` as a prefix) or using the Service Factory mechanism (under the path `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/resource-resolver/`)
+
As example, assuming you want to provide a support for the schema `foo`, then you either have to binbd your instance to the Camel Registry with `resource-loader-foo` as a key, or create a factory finder file with path `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/resource-resolver/foo`
- the method for retrieving a resource URL provided by the `org.apache.camel.support.ResourceHelper` class, i.e. `resolveMandatoryResourceAsUrl` ad ` resolveResourceAsUr` have been amended to accept a `CamelContext` instance instead of a `ClassResolver`.

=== Modularized camel-spring

The `camel-spring` component has been modularized into:

- `camel-spring` - Core module for Camel Spring support
- `camel-spring-xml` - XML DSL when using Spring XML (eg `<beans>`)

And also for Camel on Spring Boot:

- `camel-spring-boot-starter` - Camel with Spring Boot
- `camel-spring-boot-xml-starter` - XML DSL when using Spring XML (eg `<beans>`) with Spring Boot

The motivation is to move out the XML DSL from `camel-spring` which reduces the number of dependencies and makes
the module lighter.

Users that use the Spring XML DSL (eg the top XML tag is Spring `<beans>`) should migrate from using `camel-spring`
to `camel-spring-xml` as dependency.

Users that do not use Spring XML should not be affected.

In Spring XML `<proxy>` and <remote>` have been removed. They were only available in Spring XML
and not in the other XML DSLs (Blueprint and CDI).

=== camel-spring-boot-starter vs camel-spring-boot-engine-starter

Based on the modularization of camel-spring we have made two starters available when using Camel on Spring Boot

- camel-spring-boot-starter - The regular starter that includes all the core components (similar to camel-core)
- camel-spring-boot-engine-starter - A minimal starter with just Camel core engine (similar to camel-core-engine)

We also made all the component -starter JARs not depend on any of the above starters, which means you must pick
the one to use above, and then add which -starter JARs you want to use in your Camel spring boot applications.

=== Camel-AWS components removed

- Camel-AWS-SDB has been removed. There will be no substitution for this, because there isn't a SDK v2 client for this and furthermore the service is not listed in the AWS console anymore.
- Camel-AWS-Translate has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-Translate.
- Camel-AWS-SQS has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-SQS.
- Camel-AWS-SNS has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-SNS.
- Camel-AWS-MSK has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-MSK.
- Camel-AWS-MQ has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-MQ.
- Camel-AWS-KMS has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-KMS.
- Camel-AWS-Kinesis has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-Kinesis.
- Camel-AWS-Kinesis Firehose has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-Kinesis-firehose.
- Camel-AWS-IAM has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-IAM.
- Camel-AWS-EKS has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-EKS.
- Camel-AWS-ECS has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-ECS.
- Camel-AWS-EC2 has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-EC2.

- Camel-AWS-CW has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-CW.
- Camel-AWS-S3 has been removed. Please switch to Camel-AWS2-S3.
- Camel-AWS-SWF has been removed. There won't be a replacement for it.

=== Camel-Azure component

- Camel-Azure has been reomved. Please switch to Camel-Azure-Storage-Blob and Camel-Azure-Storage-Queue.
