[[ReleaseGuide-ReleaseGuide]]
= Release Guide

This guide covers how to create and announce a Camel release.

[[ReleaseGuide-Prequisites]]
== Prequisites

To prepare or perform a release you *must be* at least an Apache Camel committer.

* The artifacts for each and every release must be *signed*.
* Your public key must be added to the KEYS file.
* Your public key should also be cross-signed by other Apache committers (this can be done at key signing parties at
ApacheCon for instance).
* Make sure you have the correct maven configuration in `~/.m2/settings.xml`.
* https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[Maven Wrapper] is used and bundled with Camel 2.21 onwards and should be used
for building the release.
* You may want to get familiar with the release settings in the parent Apache POM.
* Make sure you are using Java 1.8 for Apache Camel 2.18.0 and later.

[[ReleaseGuide-MavenSetup]]
== Maven Setup
Before you deploy anything to the https://repository.apache.org[Apache Nexus repository] using Maven, you should
configure your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file so that the file permissions of the deployed artifacts are group writable.
If you do not do this, other developers will not able to overwrite your SNAPSHOT releases with newer versions.

The settings follow the guidelines used by the Maven project. Please pay particular attention to the
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[password encryption recommendations].

[[ReleaseGuide-CreatingTheRelease-Camel]]
== Creating the Release

Complete the following steps to create a new Camel release:

. Grab the latest source from Git and checkout the target branch (`BRANCH_NAME`) to build from:

  
  $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/camel.git
  $ cd camel
  $ git checkout BRANCH_NAME
  

. Perform a license check with http://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin[Apache Rat]:

  
  ./mvnw -e org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:check
  grep -e ' !?????' target/rat.txt
  

*  The latter command will provide a list of all files without valid license headers.
  Ideally this list is empty, otherwise fix the issues by adding valid license headers and rerun the above commands before
  proceeding with the next step.

. Do a release dry run to check for problems:

  
  ./mvnw release:prepare -DdryRun -Prelease
  

 * The release plugin will prompt for a release version, an SCM tag and next release version.

*  Use a three digit release version of the form: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, e.g. `3.0.0`.

*  For the tag use a string of the form: `camel-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, e.g. `camel-3.0.0`.

*  For the next version increase the patch version and append `-SNAPSHOT`, e.g. `3.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.

* Make sure to check the generated signature files:

  
  $ gpg camel-core/target/camel-core-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.asc
  gpg: assuming signed data in `camel-core/target/camel-core-3.0.0.jar'
  gpg: Signature made Sat 06 Apr 2019 03:58:01 AM PDT using RSA key ID 5942C049
  gpg: Good signature from "Gregor Zurowski <gzurowski@apache.org>"
 

. Prepare the release:

* First clean up the dry run results:


  $ ./mvnw release:clean -Prelease


* Next prepare the release:


  $ ./mvnw release:prepare -Prelease


*  This command will create the tag and update all pom files with the given version number.

. Perform the release and publish to the Apache staging repository:


  $ ./mvnw release:perform -Prelease


. Close the Apache staging repository:

* Login to https://repository.apache.org using your Apache LDAP credentials.
Click on "Staging Repositories". Then select "org.apache.camel-xxx" in the list of repositories, where xxx represents
your username and ip.
Click "Close" on the tool bar above.
This will close the repository from future deployments and make it available for others to view.
If you are staging multiple releases together, skip this step until you have staged everything.
Enter the name and version of the artifact being released in the "Description" field and then click "Close".
This will make it easier to identify it later.

. Verify staged artifacts:

* If you click on your repository, a tree view will appear below.
You can then browse the contents to ensure the artifacts are as you expect them.
Pay particular attention to the existence of *.asc (signature) files.
If the you don't like the content of the repository, right click your repository and choose "Drop".
You can then rollback your release and repeat the process.
Note the repository URL, you will need this in your vote email.

[[ReleaseGuide-CreatingTheRelease-Camel-spring-boot]]
== Creating the Release for camel-spring-boot

Complete the following steps to create a new Camel-spring-boot release:

. Grab the latest source from Git and checkout the target branch (`BRANCH_NAME`) to build from:

  $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/camel-spring-boot.git
  $ cd camel
  $ git checkout BRANCH_NAME
  
. Perform a license check with http://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin[Apache Rat]:

  ./mvnw -e org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:check
  grep -e ' !?????' target/rat.txt
  
*  The latter command will provide a list of all files without valid license headers.
  Ideally this list is empty, otherwise fix the issues by adding valid license headers and rerun the above commands before
  proceeding with the next step.

. You already have built the main camel repo for releasing, so you already have a final version in your local repository.
Change the camel-version property in https://github.com/apache/camel-spring-boot/blob/master/pom.xml accordingly and commit.

. Do a release dry run to check for problems:

  ./mvnw release:prepare -DdryRun -Prelease
  
 * The release plugin will prompt for a release version, an SCM tag and next release version.

*  Use a three digit release version of the form: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, e.g. `3.0.0`.

*  For the next version increase the patch version and append `-SNAPSHOT`, e.g. `3.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.

* Make sure to check the generated signature files:

  $ gpg core/camel-spring-boot/target/camel-spring-boot-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.asc
  gpg: assuming signed data in `core/camel-spring-boot/target/camel-spring-boot-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'
  gpg: Signature made Sat 06 Apr 2019 03:58:01 AM PDT using RSA key ID 5942C049
