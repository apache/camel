= Context Reload

The context reload functionality in Camel is capable of reloading all existing routes and property placeholders
upon an external triggered event.

For example, if you are using xref:components::aws-secrets-manager-component.adoc[AWS Secrets], then
enabling context-reload would then reload Camel routes upon a secret is updated in AWS.

The context reload is limited to refresh the following on reload:

- xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders]
- all existing xref:routes.adoc[routes] (no changes to structure of routes; see xref:route-reload.adoc[]])

General services in xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] and java beans or Camel xref:processor.adoc[] is not updated.

== Using context reloading

The context reloading can be configured in Java or with Spring Boot, Quarkus in the following way:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...

ContextReloadStrategy reload = new DefaultContextReloadStrategy();
context.addService(reload);
----

And with Camel Quarkus / Camel Main you can configure this in `application.properties:`

[source,properties]
----
# turn on context reloading
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
----

And in Spring Boot:

[source,properties]
----
# turn on context reloading
camel.springboot.context-reload-enabled = true
----

== Triggering context reloading

Any custom code can trigger context reloading. This is done by ensuring the context reload is enabled (see the note above), and
then from Java you can get hold of `ContextReloadStrategy` as follows:

[source,java]
----
ContextReloadStrategy reload = context.hasService(ContextReloadStrategy.class);
if (reload != null) {
    // trigger reload
    reload.onReload(this);
}
----

The method `onReload` will then reload all the xref:using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[property placeholders] and
then afterward reload all existing xref:routes.adoc[routes].
