= Property binding in Camel

Camel supports binding property values (key=value) in many places such as configuration of Camel
components, endpoints, EIPs, routes, and Camel bootstrap configuration.

Together with property placeholders, property placeholder functions, then there is plenty of power, but also
something that takes a little learning to master.

== Property binding features

The core of Camels property binding is implemented in `PropertyBindingSupport.java` which is used internally in Camel,
and as well can be used by Camel component developers.

The `PropertyBindingSupport` class supports binding String valued properties to an instance which uses a set of conventions:

- _property placeholders_ - Keys and values using Camels property placeholder will be resolved.
- _nested_ - Properties can be nested using the dot syntax (OGNL and builder pattern using with as prefix), eg `foo.bar=123`.
- _map_ - Properties can lookup in Map's using map syntax, eg `foo[bar]` where foo is the name of the property that is a Map instance, and bar is the name of the key.
- _list_ - Properties can refer or add to in List's using list syntax, eg `foo[0]` where foo is the name of the property that is a List instance, and 0 is the index. To refer to the last element, then use `last` as key.
- _reference by property placeholder id_ - Values can refer to a property placeholder key with `#property:myKey`
- _reference by bean id_ - Values can refer to other beans in the registry by prefixing with `#` or `#bean:` eg `#myBean` or `#bean:myBean`. It is recommended to favour using `#bean:` syntax to make it obvious it's a bean reference.
- _reference by type_ - Values can refer to singleton beans by their type in the registry by prefixing with `#type:` syntax, eg `#type:com.foo.MyClassType`.
- _autowire by type_ - Values can refer to singleton beans by auto wiring by setting the value to `#autowired`.
- _reference new class_ - Values can refer to creating new beans by their class name by prefixing with `#class`, eg `#class:com.foo.MyClassType`.
       The class is created using a default no-arg constructor, however if you need to create the instance via a factory method
       then you specify the method as shown: `#class:com.foo.MyClassType#myFactoryMethod`.
       And if the factory method requires parameters they can be specified as follows:
       `#class:com.foo.MyClassType#myFactoryMethod('Hello World', 5, true)`.
       Or if you need to create the instance via constructor parameters then you can specify the parameters as shown:
       `#class:com.foo.MyClass('Hello World', 5, true)`.
       If the factory method is on another bean or class, then you must specify this as shown:
       `#class:com.foo.MyClassType#com.foo.MyFactory:myFactoryMethod`. Where `com.foo.MyFactory` either refers to a FQN classname,
       or can refer to an existing bean by id, such as: `#class:com.foo.MyClassType#myFactoryBean:myFactoryMethod`.
- _valueAs(type):value_ - To declare that the value should be converted to the given type, such as `#valueAs(int):123`
       which indicates that the value 123 should be converted to an integer.
- _ignore case_ - Whether to ignore case for property keys (will ignore by default)

== Property binding basics

Do not get overwhelmed by the set of features and what they really do.

At the basics the property binding are used for setting values on Java objects from string values (key=value).

For example to set brokers on the Kafka component you can do:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.kafka.brokers = mykafka1,mykafka2
----

This will essentially be equivalent to configuring Kafka component in regular Java code via setters:

[source,java]
----
KafkaComponent kafka = ...
kafka.setBrokers("mykafka1,mykafka2");
----

NOTE: For configuring Camel components in Java code, there is also xref:component-dsl.adoc[Component DSL].

The configuration of Camel components, endpoints, routes etc can often require more flexibility and therefore
the property binding has many features to bind by looking up existing objects by id, or anonymously by their type,
and as well to walk down an object graph to bind nested parameters.

== Using PropertyBindingSupport in Java

Although `PropertyBindingSupport` is not primary intended for end users to use, but nevertheless its possible to use,
and also you may get a better understanding of this feature by seeing how this class is used with pure Java.

Suppose we have the following two POJOs `Foo.java` and `Bar.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class Foo {
    private String name;
    private Bar bar = new Bar();

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Bar getBar() {
        return bar;
    }

    public void setBar(Bar bar) {
        this.bar = bar;
    }
}

public class Bar {
    private int age;
    private boolean rider;

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public boolean isRider() {
        return rider;
    }

    // this has no setter but only builders and mix the builders with both styles

    public Bar withAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
        return this;
    }

    public Bar withRider(boolean rider) {
        this.rider = rider;
        return this;
    }
}
----

Then we can use `PropertyBindingSupport` to bind properties to these POJOs:

[source,java]
----
Foo foo = new Foo();

Map<String, Object> prop = new HashMap<>();
prop.put("name", "James");
prop.put("bar.age", "33");
prop.put("bar.rider", "true");

PropertyBindingSupport.bindProperties(context, foo, prop);
----

This will then set the POJOs to have the following values:

----
Foo.name = James
Foo.Bar.age = 33
Foo.Bar.rider = true
----

Instead of providing a map with all the parameters then a single parameter can also be set using builder style as shown:

[source,java]
----
Foo foo = new Foo();

PropertyBindingSupport.build().bind(context, foo, "name", "James");
PropertyBindingSupport.build().bind(context, foo, "bar.age", "33");
PropertyBindingSupport.build().bind(context, foo, "bar.rider", "true");
----

Which is more common to do as follows:

[source,java]
----
Foo foo = new Foo();

PropertyBindingSupport.build().withCamelContext(context).withTarget(foo)
    .withProperty("name", "James");
    .withProperty("bar.age", "33");
    .withProperty("bar.rider", "true")
    .bind();
----

In the example above then we are setting nested values on foo via `bar.age` and `bar.rider`. This is possible because
Foo class has a `getBar` method that returns the `Bar` instance to use:

[source,java]
----
    private Bar bar = new Bar();

    public Bar getBar() {
        return bar;
    }
----

It's a common practice for POJO classes to not create nested instances, but instead on demand. So suppose
`private Bar bar = new Bar();` was not present in the Foo class. In this situation then Camel will automatic
create a new instance of `Bar` using its default no-arg constructor. For more advanced use-cases then you
can specify how the Bar instance should be created, such as via a factory method, or pass in constructor parameters.

For example suppose Bar has a constructor parameter that accepts a boolean, we can pass that information via `#class:` as shown:

[source,java]
----
PropertyBindingSupport.build().withCamelContext(context).withTarget(foo)
    .withProperty("name", "James");
    .withProperty("bar", "#class:com.mycompany.Bar(true)")
    .withProperty("bar.age", "33");
    .withProperty("bar.rider", "true")
    .bind();
----

=== Using fluent builder class

When you are in need to configure a bean via _fluent builder class_, such as the following example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyDriverBuilder {

 private String url;
 private String username;
 private String password;

 public MyDriverBuilder url(String url) {
     this.url = url;
     return this;
 }

 public MyDriverBuilder username(String username) {
     this.username = username;
     return this;
 }

 public MyDriverBuilder password(String password) {
     this.password = password;
     return this;
 }

 public MyDriver build() {
     return new MyDriver(url, username, password);
 }
}
----

And you want to create an instance of `MyDriver` via the `MyDriverBuilder` class, then this can be done as follows:

[source,java]
----
MyDriver driver = PropertyBindingSupport.build()
  .withCamelContext(context)
  .withTarget(new MyDriverBuilder())
  .withFluentBuilder(true)
  .withProperty("url", "localhost:1234")
  .withProperty("username", "scott")
  .withProperty("password", "tiger")
  .build(MyDriver.class);
----

Notice how we use the `build(MyDriver.class)` to build the bean via the target class `.withTarget(new MyDriverBuilder())`.
The build method will by default invoke `build` as the builder method, but you can specify the name, such as `.build(MyDriver.class, "myBuilderMethod");`


== More details

Property binding is notably used when running Camel in standalone mode with Camel Main, or using Camel Spring Boot, Camel K,
Camel Kafka Connector, or Camel Quarkus. All these runtimes have a similar way of configuring via property bindings such
as from `application.properties` files.
