= UuidGenerator

Camel supports 3rd party UUID generator(s).

A useful scenario is to use a simple counter for testing purpose. With this it is
easier to correlate the exchanges in the log/debugger.

Camel uses UUIDs in the exchange and message ids, and other unique ids
it uses.

You only have to implement `org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator` and tell
Camel, that it should use your custom implementation:

== Configuring UuidGenerator

[source,java]
----
getContext().setUuidGenerator(new MyCustomUuidGenerator());
----

Camel will configure this UUID generator by doing a lookup in the Spring
bean registry to find the bean of the type `org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator`.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="simpleUuid" class="org.apache.camel.support.SimpleUuidGenerator" />

<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start" />
    <to uri="mock:result" />
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

== Standard UUID Generators

Camel comes with the following implementations out of the box:

* `org.apache.camel.support.ClassicUuidGenerator` - This is the classic Camel 2.x generator
* `org.apache.camel.support.DefaultUuidGenerator` - Default generator (32 chars) optimized for Camel usage
* `org.apache.camel.support.ShortUuidGenerator` - Is 50% the size of the default (16 chars) optimized for Camel usage
* `org.apache.camel.support.SimpleUuidGenerator` - This implementation uses
internally a `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong` and increases the
ID for every call by one. Starting with 1 as the first id.
