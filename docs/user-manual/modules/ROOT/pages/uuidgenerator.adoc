[[UuidGenerator-UuidGenerator]]
= UuidGenerator

Starting with *Camel 2.5*, Camel supports 3rd party UUID generator(s).
This is useful, if e.g. your messaging provider does not support UUID's
with a length of 36 characters (like Websphere MQ). Another useful
scenario is to use a simple counter for testing purpose. With this it is
easier to correlate the exchanges in the log/debugger.

Camel uses UUIDs in the exchange and message ids, and other unique ids
it uses.

You only have to implement `org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator` and tell
Camel, that it should use your custom implementation:

== Configuring from Java DSL

[source,java]
----
getContext().setUuidGenerator(new MyCustomUuidGenerator());
----

Warning: You should not change the UUID generator at runtime (it should only be
set once)!

[[UuidGenerator-ConfiguringfromSpringDSL]]
== Configuring from XML DSL

Camel will configure this UUID generator by doing a lookup in the Spring
bean registry to find the bean of the type
`org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator`.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="simpleUuid" class="org.apache.camel.support.SimpleUuidGenerator" />

<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start" />
    <to uri="mock:result" />
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

[[UuidGenerator-Providedimplementations]]
== Provided implementations

Camel comes with two implementations of
`org.apache.camel.spi.UuidGenerator`:

* `org.apache.camel.support.SimpleUuidGenerator` - This implementation use
internally a `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong` and increase the
ID for every call by one. Starting with 1 as the first id.
* `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultUuidGenerator` - This implementation
use a fast unique UUID generation that is cluster safe (similar to uuid generator in ActiveMQ)
