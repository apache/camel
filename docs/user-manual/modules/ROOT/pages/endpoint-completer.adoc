[[EndpointCompleter-EndpointCompleter]]
= EndpointCompleter

As of *Camel 2.12*.
This API is an optional SPI interface for xref:component.adoc[Component]
implementors. It provides a completion hook; rather like bash tab
completion, or the completion in the
http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_using_the_console[Karaf
shell] when typing commands.

Nice behaving components should implement EndpointCompleter and its
completion method. The method is given a
ComponentConfiguration object which wraps up all the various configuration values (and can be
used to create a new Endpoint instance if required - or inject values
into an exemplar internal instance).

The *completeEndpointPath()* method then returns a list of Strings of
the matching values available.

For example here's the
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/FileComponent.java#L78[implementation
code in the FileComponent to implement completeEndpointPath()].

Some example implementations include:

* xref:components::file-component.adoc[File]
