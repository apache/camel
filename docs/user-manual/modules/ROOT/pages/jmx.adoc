= JMX

Camel has optional support for JMX management which are
part of the `camel-management` and `camel-management-api` JARs.

== Using JMX to manage Apache Camel

By default (requires `camel-management` JAR to be included in the classpath),
JMX instrumentation agent is enabled in Camel, which means
that Camel runtime creates and registers MBean management objects with a
`MBeanServer` instance in the VM. This allows Camel users to instantly
obtain insights into how Camel routes perform down to the individual
processor level.

The high level supported types of management objects are:

- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedComponent.html[Component]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedConsumer.html[Donsumer]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedDataFormat.html[DataFormat]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedEndpoint.html[Endpoint]
- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedProcessor.html[Processor]

- https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-management/current/org/apache/camel/management/mbean/ManagedService.html[Service]

Most of these management objects also expose lifecycle operations in
addition to performance counter attributes.


== Disabling or enabling Camel JMX

Camel is only using JMX if `camel-management` is on the classpath.
So a quick way to enable or disable JMX is to either include or exclude this JAR on the classpath.

Its also possible to enable or disable JMX via configuration as documented in the following.

You can disable JMX instrumentation agent by setting the Java VM system
property as follows:

[source,bash]
----
-Dorg.apache.camel.jmx.disabled=true
----

The property value is treated as `boolean`.

Or, by adding a `jmxAgent` element inside the `camelContext` element in
Spring XML configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <jmxAgent id="agent" disabled="true"/>
    ...
</camelContext>
----

In Java you can disable JMX directly on the `CamelContext` as follows:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
camel.disableJMX();
----

== Camel JMX configuration options

The Camel JMX can be configured with the following options.

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |JVM System Property |Default Value |Description
|`id` |  |  |*required* The JMX agent name

|`usePlatformMBeanServer` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.usePlatformMBeanServer` |`true`
|Whether to use the MBeanServer from JVM.

|`mbeanServerDefaultDomain`
|`org.apache.camel.jmx.mbeanServerDefaultDomain` |`org.apache.camel`
|The default JMX domain of the `MBeanServer`

|`mbeanObjectDomainName` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.mbeanObjectDomainName` |`org.apache.camel`
|The JMX domain that all object names will use

|`mbeansLevel` |  |`Default`
|Configures the level for which MBeans are registered.
See section _Registering MBeans for specific resources only_ for more details.

|`onlyRegisterProcessorWithCustomId`
|`org.apache.camel.jmx.onlyRegisterProcessorWithCustomId` |`false`
|If this option is enabled then only processors with a
custom id set will be registered. This allows you to filer out unwanted
processors in the JMX console.

|`statisticsLevel` |  |`Default`
|Configures the level for whether performance statistics is enabled for the MBean.
See section _Configuring level of granularity for performance statistics_ for more details.

|`includeHostName` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.includeHostName` | `false`
|Whether to include the hostname in the MBean naming.

|`useHostIPAddress` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.useHostIPAddress` |`false`
|Whether to use hostname or IP Address in the service url
when creating the remote connector. By default the hostname will be
used.

|`loadStatisticsEnabled` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.loadStatisticsEnabled` |`false`
|Whether load statistics is enabled (gathers load statistics using a background thread per CamelContext).

|`endpointRuntimeStatisticsEnabled`
|`org.apache.camel.jmx.endpointRuntimeStatisticsEnabled` |`true`
|Whether endpoint runtime statistics is enabled (gathers runtime
usage of each incoming and outgoing endpoints).

|`mask` |`org.apache.camel.jmx.mask` |`true`
|A flag that indicates whether to remove detected sensitive information (such as passwords)
from MBean names and attributes.
|=======================================================================

=== Registering MBeans for specific resources only

By default Camel registers MBeans for the context, all the routes and the processors when its starting. You can set a level whether MBeans are registered or not when Camel starts up. The levels are:

* `Default` - Camel will register MBeans for the context, all the routes and the processors.

* `RoutesOnly` - Camel will register MBeans for the context and for all the routes. (not for any processor).

* `ContextOnly` -  Camel will register MBeans for the context (neither for any route nor for any processor).

=== Registering new MBeans for new routes or endpoints

Camel provides two settings to control when to register mbeans.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Default |Description
|`registerAlways` |`false` |If enabled then MBeans is always registered.

|`registerNewRoutes` |`true` |If enabled then adding new routes after
CamelContext has been started will also register
MBeans from that given route.
|=======================================================================

By default Camel registers MBeans for all the routes configured when its
starting. The `registerNewRoutes` option control if MBeans should also
be registered if you add new routes thereafter. You can disable this, if
you for example add and remove temporary routes where management is not
needed.

CAUTION: Be a bit careful to use the `registerAlways` option when using dynamic
EIP patterns such as the xref:components:eips:recipientList-eip.adoc[Recipient List] having unique endpoints. If so
then each unique endpoint and its associated services/producers would
also be registered. This could potentially lead to system degradation due
the rising number of mbeans in the registry. A MBean is not a
light-weight object and consumes memory.


== Management naming pattern

You can configure a naming pattern for the MBeans names that Camel creates.
The pattern is used as part of the `ObjectName` as they key after the domain name.

By default Camel will use MBean names for the `ManagedCamelContextMBean`
as follows:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=camel-1,type=context,name=camel-1
----

If you configure a name on the `CamelContext` then that name is part of
the `ObjectName` as well. For example if we have:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="myCamel" ...>
----

Then the MBean names will be as follows:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=myCamel,type=context,name=myCamel
----

Now if there is a naming clash in the JVM, such as there already exists
a MBean with that given name above, then Camel will by default try to
auto-correct this by finding a new free name in the `JMXMBeanServer` by
using a counter. As shown below the counter is now appended, so we have
`myCamel-1` as part of the `ObjectName`:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=myCamel-1,type=context,name=myCamel
----

=== Naming Patterns

This is possible because Camel uses a naming pattern by default that
supports the following tokens:

* `#camelId#` = the CamelContext id (eg the name)
* `#name#` - same as `#camelId#`
* `#counter#` - an incrementing counter
* `#bundleId#` - the OSGi bundle id (only for OSGi environments)
* `#symbolicName#` - the OSGi symbolic name (only for OSGi environments)
* `#version#` - the OSGi bundle version (only for OSGi environments)

The default naming pattern is differentiated between OSGi and non-OSGi
as follows:

* non OSGI: `#name#`
* OSGi: `#symbolicName#`

If there is a naming clash in the `JMXMBeanServer` then Camel
will automatic fallback and use the `#counter#` in the pattern to remedy
this. And thus the following patterns will then be used:

* non OSGI: `#name#-#counter#`
* OSGi: `#symbolicName#-#counter#`

If you set an explicit naming pattern, then that pattern is always used,
and the default patterns above is *not* used.

This allows us to have full control, very easily, of the naming for both
the `CamelContext` id in the Registry as well the JMX MBeans in the `JMXMBeanRegistry`.

So if we want to explicit name both the `CamelContext` and to use fixed
MBean names, that do not change (eg has no counters), then we can use
the `managementNamePattern` attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="myCamel" managementNamePattern="#name#">
----

Then the MBean names will always be as follows:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.camel:context=myCamel,type=context,name=myCamel
----

In Java, you can configure the `managementNamePattern` as follows:

[source,java]
----
context.getManagementNameStrategy().setNamePattern("#name#");
----

== Configuring performance statistics

You can set a level whether performance statistics is
enabled or not when Camel starts up. The levels are:

* `Extended` - As default but with additional statistics gathered during
runtime such as fine grained level of usage of endpoints and more.

* ``Default` - Camel will enable statistics for both routes and
processors (fine grained).

* `RoutesOnly` - Camel will only enable statistics for routes (coarse
grained)

* `Off` - Camel will not use any statistics.


[NOTE]
====
*What does statistics enabled mean?*

Statistics enabled means that Camel will do fine grained performance
statistics for that particular MBean. The statistics you can see are
many, such as: number of exchanges completed/failed,
last/total/mina/max/mean processing time, first/last failed time, etc.

====

Using Java DSL you set the statistics level by:

[source,java]
----
// only enable routes when Camel starts
context.getManagementStrategy().setStatisticsLevel(ManagementStatisticsLevel.RoutesOnly);
----

And from XML DSL you can do:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <jmxAgent id="agent" statisticsLevel="RoutesOnly"/>
 ...
</camelContext>
----

=== Performance load statistics

It is possible to include load statistics
per CamelContext and Route MBeans. The statistics is
average load based on the number of in-flight exchanges, on a per 1, 5,
and 15 minute rate. This is similar to load statistics on Unix systems.

You can enable this by setting `loadStatisticsEnabled=true`.

== Hiding sensitive information

By default, Camel enlists MBeans in JMX such as endpoints configured
using URIs. In this configuration, there may be
sensitive information such as passwords.

This will mask URIs having options such as password and
passphrase, and use `xxxxxx` as the replacement value.

=== Masking JMX attributes in custom components

When implementing custom Camel components you can mark which
JMX attributes to mask with the `@ManagedAttribute` and `@ManagedOperation` annotations.

Te attribute `mask` can be set to `true` to indicate that the result of this JMX
attribute/operation should be masked (if enabled on JMX agent, see
above).

For example, on the default managed endpoints from camel-core
`org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean.ManagedEndpointMBean`, we have
declared that the `EndpointUri` JMX attribute is masked:

[source,java]
----
@ManagedAttribute(description = "Endpoint URI", mask = true)
String getEndpointUri();
----
