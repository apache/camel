= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.6 to 4.7

=== camel-core

Add default values to `ThrottlingExceptionRoutePolicy` route policy.

=== DSL

The Load Balancer EIP has aligned naming and the following balancers has been renamed in XML and YAML DSL:

|===
|*Old Name* |*New Name*

| failOver | failOverLoadBalancer
| random | randomLoadBalancer
| roundRobin | roundRobinLoadBalancer
| sticky | stickyLoadBalancer
| topic | topicLoadBalancer
| weighted | weightedLoadBalancer
|===

For example in XML you need to change from:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <loadBalance>
      <failover>
          <exception>java.io.IOException</exception>
      </failover>
      <to uri="direct:x"/>
      <to uri="direct:y"/>
      <to uri="direct:z"/>
  </loadBalance>
</route>
----

To:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <loadBalance>
      <failoverLoadBalancer>
          <exception>java.io.IOException</exception>
      </failoverLoadBalancer>
      <to uri="direct:x"/>
      <to uri="direct:y"/>
      <to uri="direct:z"/>
  </loadBalance>
</route>
----


=== camel-spring-security

The `camel-spring-security` component has been updated to improve readiness for Spring Security 7.x. Since Spring Security 5.8 the `AccessDecisionManager` interface and the related cooperating classes have been deprecated in favor of `AuthorizationManager` based patterns.
If you are creating Spring Security route policies in your code, you must now refactor them to be based on an `AuthorizationManager`.

For example, you might have a route policy defined as follows:
```java
SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy authorizationPolicy = new SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy();
authorizationPolicy.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);
authorizationPolicy.setSpringSecurityAccessPolicy(new SpringSecurityAccessPolicy("ROLE_ADMIN"));
authorizationPolicy.setAccessDecisionManager(new AffirmativeBased(Collections.singletonList(new RoleVoter())));
```
With the changes implemented in this release, that must be refactored to:
```java
SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy authorizationPolicy = new SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy();
authorizationPolicy.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);
authorizationPolicy.setAuthorizationManager(AuthorityAuthorizationManager.hasRole("ADMIN"));
```
This new pattern supports a more expressive language to define your own authorization rules, exposing the full power of the Spring Security framework to Camel route policies.
See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.8/migration/servlet/authorization.html#servlet-replace-permissionevaluator-bean-with-methodsecurityexpression-handler[spring documentation] for further details on how to migrate your custom code from `AccessDecisionManager` to `AuthorizationManager`.

=== camel-as2

The `camel-as2` component has been updated so that the client can compress a MIME body before signing or compress a MIME body before signing and encrypting as described in
sections https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5402/#section-3.2[3.2] and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5402/#section-3.5[3.5] of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5402/[rfc 5402].


== Camel Spring Boot

=== camel-debug-starter

Using camel debugger with Spring Boot is now moved from `camel-spring-boot` into `camel-debug-starter` where you can configure the debugger
via `camel.debug.` options in `application.properties`.
