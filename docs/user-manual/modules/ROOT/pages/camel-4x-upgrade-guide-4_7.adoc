= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.6 to 4.7

=== camel-core

Add default values to `ThrottlingExceptionRoutePolicy` route policy.

The `EndpointRegistry` interface has been slightly changed to now directly extends `Map<NormalizedEndpointUri, Endpoint>` 
instead of being a parameterized type.  This may cause some compilation failures if the code is declaring a variable for the registry.

=== camel-health

Routes which has are set to **not** auto-startup are reported as UP in health-checks.
We have now implemented similar logic for the consumer health check as well (the route and consumer health check are linked together).

Previously a route that has not been started due to `auto-startup=false` would still have its consumer health-check being executed,
which could lead to DOWN due to consumer failing the check.

The `SupervisingRouteController` has now been pre-configured to report `DOWN` during restart attempts, and also when
giving up starting a route. It is the `UnhealthyOnExhausted` and `UnhealthyOnRestarting` options that have been changed to be default `true`.
To have previous behavior you can set these options to `false`.

=== DSL

The Load Balancer EIP has aligned naming and the following balancers has been renamed in XML and YAML DSL:

|===
|*Old Name* |*New Name*

| failOver | failOverLoadBalancer
| random | randomLoadBalancer
| roundRobin | roundRobinLoadBalancer
| sticky | stickyLoadBalancer
| topic | topicLoadBalancer
| weighted | weightedLoadBalancer
|===

For example in XML you need to change from:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <loadBalance>
      <failover>
          <exception>java.io.IOException</exception>
      </failover>
      <to uri="direct:x"/>
      <to uri="direct:y"/>
      <to uri="direct:z"/>
  </loadBalance>
</route>
----

To:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <loadBalance>
      <failoverLoadBalancer>
          <exception>java.io.IOException</exception>
      </failoverLoadBalancer>
      <to uri="direct:x"/>
      <to uri="direct:y"/>
      <to uri="direct:z"/>
  </loadBalance>
</route>
----

=== camel-debug

The debugger (using `org.apache.camel.spi.BacklogDebugger`) used for tooling such as IDEA and Visual Studio, is fixed
to work better out-of-the-box by just having `camel-debug` JAR or `camel-debug-starter` (for Spring Boot) on the classpath.

An internal change is that the MBean operation `messageHistoryOnBreakpointAsXml` on `ManagedBacklogDebugger` now includes
the current node as last message history, which was expected by IDEA tooling, to make it function again.

=== camel-spring-security

The `camel-spring-security` component has been updated to improve readiness for Spring Security 7.x. Since Spring Security 5.8 the `AccessDecisionManager` interface and the related cooperating classes have been deprecated in favor of `AuthorizationManager` based patterns.
If you are creating Spring Security route policies in your code, you must now refactor them to be based on an `AuthorizationManager`.

For example, you might have a route policy defined as follows:

[source,java]
----
SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy authorizationPolicy = new SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy();
authorizationPolicy.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);
authorizationPolicy.setSpringSecurityAccessPolicy(new SpringSecurityAccessPolicy("ROLE_ADMIN"));
authorizationPolicy.setAccessDecisionManager(new AffirmativeBased(Collections.singletonList(new RoleVoter())));
----

With the changes implemented in this release, that must be refactored to:

[source,java]
----
SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy authorizationPolicy = new SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy();
authorizationPolicy.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);
authorizationPolicy.setAuthorizationManager(AuthorityAuthorizationManager.hasRole("ADMIN"));
----

This new pattern supports a more expressive language to define your own authorization rules, exposing the full power of the Spring Security framework to Camel route policies.
See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.8/migration/servlet/authorization.html#servlet-replace-permissionevaluator-bean-with-methodsecurityexpression-handler[spring documentation] for further details on how to migrate your custom code from `AccessDecisionManager` to `AuthorizationManager`.

=== camel-as2

The `camel-as2` component has been updated so that the client can compress a MIME body before signing or compress a MIME body before signing and encrypting as described in
sections https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5402/#section-3.2[3.2] and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5402/#section-3.5[3.5] of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5402/[rfc 5402].

=== camel-cloudevents

Moved the `camel-cloudevents` api into `camel-api` and removed the `camel-cloudevents` dependency from all components that provide CloudEvent transformers.

=== camel-hashicorp-vault

The `HashicorpVaultPropertiesFunction` from the hashicorp vault has been changed to avoid declaring statically the Vault Engine.

This means the `camel.vault.hashicorp.engine` property and the support for `CAMEL_HASHICORP_VAULT_ENGINE` environment variable have been removed.

You can now use the following syntax:

`hashicorp:engine:secret`

Where engine will be the Hashicorp Vault Engine to be used. This means you'll be able to use multiple engines at the same time. More details at CAMEL-20775 issue.

=== Camel Spring Boot

==== camel-debug-starter

Using camel debugger with Spring Boot is now moved from `camel-spring-boot` into `camel-debug-starter` where you can configure the debugger
via `camel.debug.` options in `application.properties`.

The `camel-debug-starter` now has `camel.debug.enabled=true` by default to let the debugger be installed out of the box,
by having the JAR on the classpath (as intended). You can turn this off via `camel.debug.enabled=false`.
