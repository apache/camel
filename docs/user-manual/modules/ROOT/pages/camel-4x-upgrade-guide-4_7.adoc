= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.6 to 4.7

=== camel-spring-security

The `camel-spring-security` component has been updated to improve readiness for Spring Security 7.x. Since Spring Security 5.8 the `AccessDecisionManager` interface and the related cooperating classes have been deprecated in favor of `AuthorizationManager` based patterns.
If you are creating Spring Security route policies in your code, you must now refactor them to be based on an `AuthorizationManager`.

For example, you might have a route policy defined as follows:
```java
SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy authorizationPolicy = new SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy();
authorizationPolicy.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);
authorizationPolicy.setSpringSecurityAccessPolicy(new SpringSecurityAccessPolicy("ROLE_ADMIN"));
authorizationPolicy.setAccessDecisionManager(new AffirmativeBased(Collections.singletonList(new RoleVoter())));
```
With the changes implemented in this release, that must be refactored to:
```java
SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy authorizationPolicy = new SpringSecurityAuthorizationPolicy();
authorizationPolicy.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);
authorizationPolicy.setAuthorizationManager(AuthorityAuthorizationManager.hasRole("ADMIN"));
```
This new pattern supports a more expressive language to define your own authorization rules, exposing the full power of the Spring Security framework to Camel route policies.
See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.8/migration/servlet/authorization.html#servlet-replace-permissionevaluator-bean-with-methodsecurityexpression-handler[spring documentation] for further details on how to migrate your custom code from `AccessDecisionManager` to `AuthorizationManager`.
