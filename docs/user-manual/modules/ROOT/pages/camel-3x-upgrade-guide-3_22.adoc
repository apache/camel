= Apache Camel 3.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 3.x to 3.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 3.0 to 3.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 3.0 to 3.1 and 3.1 to 3.2.

== Upgrading Camel 3.21 to 3.22

No changes expected.

== Upgrading Camel 3.22.x to 3.22.3

=== camel-file

The `readLock=changed` with using `readLockMinAge` has been restored to same behaviour as previously in 3.x.

For example, using `readLockMinAge=5s` would pickup files that are older than 5 seconds from startup time.
If you have many existing files on startup that are old, then Camel will now again be fast,
and pick up these files immediately.
