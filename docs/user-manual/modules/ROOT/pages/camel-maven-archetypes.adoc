The maven coordinates for these archetypes is the following:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.archetypes</groupId>
  <artifactId>${archetype-name}</artifactId>
  <version>${camel-version}</version>
----

[NOTE]
====
When using these archetypes, make sure your package name is not
org.apache.camel (or a sub package of this) as this will instruct Camel
to search in its own packages for your routes. This can also cause Camel
not to start, as shown in CAMEL-1197.
====

[[CamelMavenArchetypes-Snapshotarchetypes]]
== Snapshot archetypes

If you would like to use an archetype from an unreleased version of
Camel, you just need to let the maven-archetype-plugin know where to
look for it. For example, say someone wanted to create a WAR based
project based on Camel 2.9.0. He'd need to use the following command

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-web \
  -DarchetypeVersion=2.9.0 \
  -DarchetypeRepository=https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-group
----

Notice that archetypes will now be downloaded from
https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-group[Apache's
snapshot repo] instead of http://repo1.maven.org/maven2[Maven central].

When the project is created, you may need to add another repository to
the pom.xml file. This is to load a SNAPSHOT version of the
camel-maven-plugin

[source,xml]
----
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots/>
    <id>Apache Snapshot Repository</id>
    <url>http://repository.apache.org/snapshots</url>
  </pluginRepository>
