= Camel Console

The `camel-console` is available from *Camel 3.15* and newer versions.

The Camel Developer Console is intended assisting developers and can display
various information about a running Camel application.

Camel comes with a set of consoles out of the box from `camel-console` and `camel-catalog-console` JARs.
These consoles can display general information about the running JVM and the OS Environment, and of course
Camel related information such as runtime metrics of the Camel routes, and a lot more.

== Using Camel Console

The `camel-console` must be added to the classpath, and enabled either via

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.setDevConsole(true);
----

If using Camel Main / Spring Boot / Quarkus etc then the console can be enabled via
configuration:

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.dev-console-enabled = true
----

=== Dev Console and Camel Spring Boot

The Camel developer console is available in Spring Boot as an _actuator_. To enable the console
you need to add dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-console-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

To include more details such as route metrics you need to include JMX management:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-management-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

And finally you **must** enable `camel` in the exposed list of HTTP actuator endpoints in `application.properties` as shown:

[source,properties]
----
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=info,health,camel
----

The console is then available on HTTP (using default port):

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/actuator/camel
----

This will list the available consoles, and you can then call a console by its id, such as `routes`:

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/actuator/camel/routes
----

=== Dev Console and Camel JBang

The Developer Console is easily available when using xref:camel-jbang.adoc[Camel JBang],
by the `--console` argument when running JBang.

For example to run a Camel route from `foo.yaml` and additional configurations from `myapp.properties` you can run as follows
and have the console started and accessible from `http://localhost:8080/dev`

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang camel@apache/camel run foo.yaml myapp.properties --console
----

== Writing Custom Dev Consoles

To write a custom console, you need to add `camel-console` as dependency, as it comes with the
base class `AbstractDevConsole` which we extend for our console.

[source,java]
----
@DevConsole("foo")
public class FooConsole extends AbstractDevConsole {

    public FooConsole() {
        super("acme", "foo", "Foolish", "A foolish console that outputs something");
    }

    @Override
    protected String doCallText(Map<String, Object> options) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("Hello from my custom console");

        // more stuff here

        return sb.toString();
    }

    @Override
    protected JsonObject doCallJson(Map<String, Object> options) {
        JsonObject root = new JsonObject();
        root.put("message", "Hello from my custom console");

        // more stuff here

        return root;
    }

}
----

The class must be annotated with `DevConsole` and the unique id of the console (must be unique across all consoles).
In the constructor the console specifies which group, id, display title, and description to use.

The `doCallText` and `doCallJson` methods is responsible for gathering the information the console should output.

If the console does not support either text or json output, then the methods can return `null`,
and override the `supportMediaType` method and return `true` for the media-type that are supported.

=== Supported Media Types

A console can support any of, or all of the following types:

- TEXT
- JSON

The intention for `TEXT` is to be plain/text based that can be outputted in CLI and other low-level tools.

For `JSON` then the intention is the console outputs a json dataset with key/value pairs that
holds the information, which can be displayed in a custom fashion such as in a web browser, or IDE tool such as VSCode.

=== Maven Configuration

To make Camel able to discover custom dev consoles, then the xref:camel-component-maven-plugin.adoc[came-component-maven-plugin]
must be used, such as:

[source,xml]
