= Delayer

The Delayer is used for slowing processing of messages.

This allows you to set a fixed amount of delay between each step a message passes in
the route, to better show how things is happening nice and slowly, so you
are not bombarded with a zillion lines of logging output.

== Using Delayer

The delayer can be configured on two levels:

- CamelContext - _Globally_
- Route - _Individually per route_

=== Configuring using XML DSL

Just set the `delayer` attribute of the `<camelContext>` tag as shown below:

[source,xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<camelContext id="camel" delayer="500" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="mock:result"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Configuring using Java

You can enable delaying messages by setting the delay value on the `CamelContext` as shown:

[source,java]
-----------------------------
camelContext.setDelayer(200);
-----------------------------

=== Configuring on route level

You can also configure it on both camel context and per route
as you like. Per route will override the camel context setting.

For example the route below is only the first route that has a delayer with 200 millis.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
   <route delayer="200">
     ...
   </route>

   <route>
     ...
   </route>
</camelContext>
----

And in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").delayer(200)
    .to("mock:result")
----
