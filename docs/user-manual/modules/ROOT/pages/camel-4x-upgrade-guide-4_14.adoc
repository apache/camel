= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.13 to 4.14

=== camel-core

=== camel-google

The scopes parameter for camel-google-calendar, camel-google-calendar-streams, camel-google-drive, camel-google-mail, camel-google-mail-streams and camel-google-sheets-streams has been defined as String instead of Collection<String>. For the migration users will need to, eventually, define scopes as a comma separated list of scopes instead of a Collection instance. For more information the related issue is CAMEL-22247.
