= Apache Camel 4.x Upgrade Guide

This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.

== Upgrading Camel 4.13 to 4.14

=== camel-core

=== camel-jbang

The `camel export` will not include `camel-observabilities-services` out of the box. To include this, then use `--observe` to enable
this during export.

Notice when exporting to kubernetes then `camel-observabilities-services` is always enabled.

=== camel-google

The scopes parameter for camel-google-calendar, camel-google-calendar-streams, camel-google-drive, camel-google-mail, camel-google-mail-streams and camel-google-sheets-streams has been defined as String instead of Collection<String>. For the migration users will need to, eventually, define scopes as a comma separated list of scopes instead of a Collection instance. For more information the related issue is CAMEL-22247.

=== camel-consul

The nodeMeta and the tags parameter for camel-consul has been defined as String instead of List<String>. For the migration users will need to, eventually, define nodeMeta as a comma separated list of nodeMeta instead of a List or Set instance. For more information the related issue is CAMEL-17339.

=== camel-dapr

The configKeys parameter for camel-dapr has been defined as String instead of List<String>. For the migration users will need to, eventually, define configKeys as a comma separated list of config Keys instead of a List instance. For more information the related issue is CAMEL-17339.
