= CamelContext Auto Configuration

The xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] is autoconfigured when running Camel with either
xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main], Camel Spring Boot, Camel Quarkus, or Camel K.

== Camel Auto Configuration

Under these runtimes then the auto configuration is performed by shared code from the `camel-main` JAR
to ensure the configuration is similar on these runtimes.

The auto configuration is executed in several steps:

1. Configure `CamelContext` (and more such as components) from xref:components::properties-component.adoc[properties] from external sources like `application.properties|yaml`
2. Configure optional services that has been registering in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]

=== Auto configuration of Properties

This is used for configuring the standard set of options (more than 100 options) which is listed in the _Camel Main Options_ table at xref:components:others:main.adoc[Camel Main].

NOTE: When using Camel on Spring Boot then these options are prefixed with `camel.springboot`, and not `camel.main`.

=== Auto configuration of Optional Services

After configuring the standard options, then Camel will look in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry] for custom
services to be used. For example to plugin a custom `UnitOfWorkFactory`.

The services can be anything that can be plugged into Camel (typically services that implement an SPI interface `org.apache.camel.spi`).

The following SPI services, can only a single instance (singleton) be in the xref:registry.adoc[Registry].
