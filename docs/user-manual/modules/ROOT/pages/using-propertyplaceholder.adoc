= Property placeholders

Camel has extensive support for property placeholders, which
can be used _almost anywhere_ in your Camel xref:routes.adoc[routes],
xref:endpoint.adoc[endpoints], xref:dsl.adoc[DSL], and xref:route-configuration.adoc[route configuration],
xref:bean-integration.adoc[bean integration] and elsewhere.

Property placeholders are used to define a _placeholder_ instead of the actual value.
This is important as you would want to be able to make your applications external
configurable, such as values for network addresses, port numbers, authentication credentials,
login tokens, and configuration in general.

== Properties component

Camel provides the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] out of the box
from the core, which is responsible for handling and resolving the property placeholders.

See the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] documentation for how
to configure Camel to known from which location(a) to load properties.


== Property placeholder syntax

The value of a Camel property can be obtained by specifying its key name
within a property placeholder, using the following syntax: `{\{key}}`

For example:

[source,text]
----
{{file.uri}}
----

where `file.uri` is the property key.

Property placeholders can be used to specify parts, or all, of an
endpoint's URI by embedding one or more placeholders in the URI's string
definition.

=== Using property placeholder with default value

You can specify a default value to use if a
property with the key does not exist, where the default value is the text after the colon:

[source,text]
----
{{file.url:/some/path}}
----

In this case the default value is `/some/path`.

=== Using optional property placeholders

Camel's elaborate property placeholder feature supports optional placeholders,
which is defined with the `?` (question mark) as prefix in the key name, as shown:

[source,text]
----
{{?myBufferSize}}
----

If a value for the key exists then the value is used, however if the key does not exists,
then Camel understands this, such as when used in xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoints]:

[source,text]
----
file:foo?bufferSize={{?myBufferSize}}
----

Then the `bufferSize` option will only be configured in the endpoint, if a placeholder exists.
Otherwise the option will not be set on the endpoint, meaning the endpoint would be _restructued_ as:

[source,text]
----
file:foo
----

Then the option `bufferSize` is not in specified at all, and this would allow Camel to
use the standard default value for `bufferSize` if any exists.

=== Reverse a boolean value

If a property placeholder is a boolean value, then it is possible to negate (reverse) the value by using `!` as prefix in the key.

[source,properties]
----
integration.ftpEnabled=true
----

[source,java]
----
from("ftp:....").autoStartup("{{integration.ftpEnabled}}")
    .to("kafka:cheese")

from("jms:....").autoStartup("{{!integration.ftpEnabled}}")
    .to("kafka:cheese")
----

In the example above then the FTP route or the JMS route should only be started. So if the FTP is enabled then JMS should be disable, and vise-versa.
We can do this be negating the `autoStartup` in the JMS route, by using `!integration.ftpEnabled` as the key.


== Using property placeholders

When using property placeholders in the endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URIs] you should use this with the syntax `{\{key}}` as shown in this example:

[source,properties]
----
cool.end = mock:result
where = cheese
----

And in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("{{cool.end}}");
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="{{cool.end}}"/>
</route>
----

A property placeholder may also just be a one part in the endpoint URI.
A common use-case is to use a placeholder for an endpoint option such
as the size of the write buffer in the file endpoint:

[source,properties]
----
buf = 8192
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("file:outbox?bufferSize={{buf}}");
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="file:outbox?bufferSize={{buf}}"/>
</route>
----

However the placeholder can be anywhere, so it could also be the name of a mock endpoint

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("mock:{{where}}");
----

In the example above the mock endpoint, is already hardcoded to start with `mock:`,
and the `where` placeholder has the value `cheese` so the resolved uri becomes `mock:cheese`.

=== Property placeholders referring to other properties (nested placeholders)

You can also have properties with refer to each other such as:

[source,properties]
----
cool.foo=result
cool.concat=mock:{{cool.foo}}
----

Notice how `cool.concat` refer to another property.

And the route in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="{{cool.concat}}"/>
</route>
----

==== Turning off nested placeholders

If the placeholder value contains data that interfere with the property placeholder syntax `{{` and `}}` (such as JSon data),
you can be then explicit turn off nested placeholder by `?nested=false` in the key name, such as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="elasticsearch:foo?query={{myQuery?nested=false}}"/>
</route>
----

In the example above the placeholder _myQuery_ placeholder value is as follows

[source,json]
----
{"query":{"match_all":{}}}
----

Notice how the json query ends with `}}` which interfere with the Camel property placeholder syntax.

Nested placeholders can also be turned off globally on the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component, such as:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext context = ...
context.getPropertiesComponent().setNestedPlaceholder(false);
----

=== Escape a property placeholder

The property placeholder can be problematic if the double curly brackets are used by a third party library like for example a query in ElasticSearch of type `{"query":{"match_all":{}}}`.

To work around that it is possible to escape the double curly brackets with a backslash character like for example `\{{ property-name \}}`. This way, it won't be interpreted as a property placeholder to resolve and will be resolved as `{{ property-name }}`.

If for some reason, the backslash character before the double curly brackets must not be interpreted as an escape character, it is possible to add another backslash in front of it to escape it, it will then be seen as a backslash.

=== Using property placeholders multiple times

You can of course also use placeholders several times:

[source,properties]
----
cool.start=direct:start
cool.showid=true
cool.result=result
----

And in this route we use `cool.start` two times:

[source,java]
----
from("{{cool.start}}")
    .to("log:{{cool.start}}?showBodyType=false&showExchangeId={{cool.showid}}")
    .to("mock:{{cool.result}}");
----

=== Using property placeholders with producer template

You can also your property placeholders when using
xref:producertemplate.adoc[ProducerTemplate] for example:

[source,java]
----
template.sendBody("{{cool.start}}", "Hello World");
----

=== Using property placeholders with consumer template

This can also be done when using xref:consumertemplate.adoc[ConsumerTemplate], such as:

[source,java]
----
Object body = template.receiveBody("{{cool.start}}");
----

== Resolving property placeholders from Java code

If you need to resolve property placeholder(s) from some Java code, then Camel has two APIs for this:

- You can use the method `resolveProperty` on the `PropertiesComponent` to resolve a single property from Java code.
- Use the method `resolvePropertyPlaceholders` on the `CamelContext` to resolve (one or more) property placeholder(s) in a String.

For example to resolve a placeholder with key foo, you can do:

[source,java]
----
Optional<String> prop = camelContext.getPropertiesComponent().resolveProperty("foo");
if (prop.isPresent()) {
    String value = prop.get();
    ....
}
----

This API is to lookup a single property and returns a `java.util.Optional` type.

The `CamelContext` have another API which is capable of resolving multiple placeholders, and interpolate placeholders from an input String.
Lets try with an example to explain this:

[source,java]
----
String msg = camelContext.resolvePropertyPlaceholders("{{greeting}} Camel user, Camel is {{cool}} dont you think?");
----

The input string is a text statement which have two placeholders that will be resolved, for example:

[source,properties]
----
greeting = Hi
cool = awesome
----

Will be resolved to:

[source,text]
----
Hi Camel user, Camel is awesome dont you think?
----

== Using property placeholders for any kind of attribute in Spring XML files

Previously it was only the `xs:string` type attributes in the XML DSL
that support placeholders. For example often a timeout attribute would
be a `xs:int` type and thus you cannot set a string value as the
placeholder key. This is now possible using a special
placeholder namespace.

In the example below we use the `prop` prefix for the namespace
`\http://camel.apache.org/schema/placeholder`. Now we can use `prop:` as prefix
to configure any kind of XML attributes in Spring XML files.

In the example below we want to use a placeholder for the `stopOnException` option in
the xref:components:eips:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] EIP. The `stopOnException` is a `xs:boolean` type,
so we cannot configure this as:

[source,xml]
----
<multicast stopOnException="{{stop}}">
   ...
</multicast>
----

Instead, we must use the `prop:` namespace, so we must add this namespace
in the top of the XML file in the `<beans>` tag.

To configure the option we must then use the `prop:optionName` as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<multicast prop:stopOnException="stop">
  ...
</multicast>
----

The complete example is below:

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:prop="http://camel.apache.org/schema/placeholder"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd">

    <bean id="damn" class="java.lang.IllegalArgumentException">
        <constructor-arg index="0" value="Damn"/>
    </bean>

    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
        <propertyPlaceholder id="properties" location="classpath:myprop.properties"/>
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:start"/>
            <!-- use prop namespace, to define a property placeholder, which maps to option stopOnException={{stop}} -->
            <multicast prop:stopOnException="stop">
                <to uri="mock:a"/>
                <throwException ref="damn"/>
                <to uri="mock:b"/>
            </multicast>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
</beans>
----

In our properties file we have the value defined as:

[source,properties]
----
stop = true
----


== Bridging Camel property placeholders with Spring XML files

NOTE: If you are using Spring Boot then this does not apply.
This is only for legacy Camel and Spring applications which are using Spring XML files.

The Spring Framework does not allow third-party frameworks such as
Apache Camel to seamless hook into the Spring property placeholder
mechanism. However, you can bridge Spring and Camel by declaring a
Spring bean with the type
`org.apache.camel.spring.spi.BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`,
which is a Spring
`org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`
type.

To bridge Spring and Camel you must define a single bean as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- bridge spring property placeholder with Camel -->
<!-- you must NOT use the <context:property-placeholder at the same time, only this bridge bean -->
<bean id="bridgePropertyPlaceholder" class="org.apache.camel.spring.spi.BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
  <property name="location" value="classpath:org/apache/camel/component/properties/cheese.properties"/>
</bean>
----

You *must not* use the spring `<context:property-placeholder>` namespace
at the same time; this is not possible.

After declaring this bean, you can define property placeholders using
both the Spring style, and the Camel style within the `<camelContext>`
tag as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- a bean that uses Spring property placeholder -->
<!-- the ${hi} is a spring property placeholder -->
<bean id="hello" class="org.apache.camel.component.properties.HelloBean">
  <property name="greeting" value="${hi}"/>
</bean>

<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <!-- in this route we use Camels property placeholder {{ }} style -->
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:{{cool.bar}}"/>
    <bean ref="hello"/>
    <to uri="{{cool.end}}"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

Notice how the hello bean is using pure Spring property placeholders using
the `${}` notation. And in the Camel routes we use the Camel
placeholder notation with `{\{key}}`.

== Using property placeholder functions

The xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component includes the following functions out of the box:

* `env` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables
* `sys` - A function to lookup the property from Java JVM system properties
* `service` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom
* `service.name` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom returning the hostname part only
* `service.port` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom returning the port part only

These functions are intended to make it easy to lookup values from the environment, as shown in the example below:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{env:SOMENAME}}"/>
        <to uri="{{sys:MyJvmPropertyName}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

You can use default values as well, so if the property does not exist, you can define a default value as shown below, where the default value is a `log:foo` and `log:bar` value.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{env:SOMENAME:log:foo}}"/>
        <to uri="{{sys:MyJvmPropertyName:log:bar}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

The service function is for looking up a service which is defined using OS environment variables using the service naming idiom, to refer to a service location using `hostname : port`

* __NAME__**_SERVICE_HOST**
* __NAME__**_SERVICE_PORT**

in other words the service uses `_SERVICE_HOST` and `_SERVICE_PORT` as prefix.
So if the service is named FOO, then the OS environment variables should be set as

[source,bash]
----
export $FOO_SERVICE_HOST=myserver
export $FOO_SERVICE_PORT=8888
----

For example if the FOO service a remote HTTP service, then we can refer to the service in the Camel endpoint uri, and use the HTTP component to make the HTTP call:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="http://{{service:FOO}}/myapp"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

And we can use default values if the service has not been defined, for example to call a service on localhost, maybe for unit testing.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="http://{{service:FOO:localhost:8080}}/myapp"/>
</route>
</camelContext>
----

=== Using Kubernetes property placeholder functions

The `camel-kubernetes` component include the following functions:

* `configmap` - A function to lookup the property from Kubernetes ConfigMaps.
* `secret` - A function to lookup the property from Kubernetes Secrets.

The syntax for both functions are:

[source]
----
configmap:name/key[:defaultValue]
----

Where the default value is optional, for example the following will lookup `myKey`,
and fail if there is no such configmap.

[source]
----
configmap:mymap/mykey
----

In this example then it would not fail as a default value is provided:

[source]
----
configmap:mymap/mykey:123
----

Before the Kubernetes property placeholder functions can be used they need to be configured with either (or both)

- path - A _mount path_ that must be mounted to the running pod, to load the configmaps or secrets from local disk.
- kubernetes client - *Autowired* An `io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClient` instance to use for connecting to the Kubernetes API server.

Camel will first use _mount paths_ (if configured) to lookup, and then fallback to use the `KubernetesClient`.

==== Configuring mount paths for ConfigMaps and Secrets

The configuration of the _mount path_ are used by the given order:

1. Reading configuration property with keys `camel.kubernetes-config.mount-path-configmaps`
and `camel.kubernetes-config.mount-path-secrets`.
2. Use JVM system property with key `camel.k.mount-path.configmaps` and `camel.k.mount-path.secrets` (Camel K compatible).
3. Use OS ENV variable with key `camel.k.mount-path.configmaps` and `camel.k.mount-path.secrets` (Camel K compatible).

For example to use `/etc/camel/resources/` as mount path, you can configure this in the `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
camel.kubernetes-config.mount-path-configmaps = /etc/camel/myconfig/
camel.kubernetes-config.mount-path-secrets = /etc/camel/mysecrets/
----

==== Configuring Kubernetes Client

Camel will autowire the `KubernetesClient` if a single instance of the client exists in the running application (lookup via the xref:registry.adoc[Registry]).
Otherwise, a new `KubernetesClient` is created. The client can be configured from either

- Using `camel.kubernetes-config.client.` properties (see below for example)
- Attempt to auto-configure itself by a combination of OS Environment variables, reading from `~./kube/config` configuration,
and service account token file. For more details see the https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client documentation.

You most likely only need to explicit configure the `KubernetesClient` when you want to connect
from a local computer to a remote Kubernetes cluster, where you can specify various options,
such as the masterUrl and oauthToken as shown:

[source,properties]
----
camel.kubernetes-config.client.masterUrl = https://127.0.0.1:50179/
camel.kubernetes-config.client.oauthToken = eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI...
----

The `KubernetesClient` has many options, see the https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client documentation.

If you only use _mount paths_ then its good practice to disable `KubernetesClient` which can be done by setting enabled to false as show:

[source,properties]
----
camel.kubernetes-config.client-enabled = false
----

When running your Camel applications inside an existing Kubernetes cluster, then you often
would not need to explicit configure the `KubernetesClient` and can rely on default settings.

TIP: If you use Camel Quarkus, then it is recommended to use their https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes-config
which automatic pre-configure the `KubernetesClient` which Camel then will reuse.

==== Using configmap with Kubernetes

Given a configmap named `myconfig` in Kubernetes that has two entries:

[source,properties]
----
drink = beer
first = Carlsberg
----

Then these values can be used in your Camel routes such as:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <log message="What {{configmap:myconfig/drink}} do you want?"/>
    <log message="I want {{configmap:myconfig/first}}"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

You can also provide a default value in case a key does not exists:

[source,xml]
----
    <log message="I want {{configmap:myconfig/second:Heineken}}"/>
----

==== Using secrets with Kubernetes

Camel reads ConfigMaps from the Kubernetes API Server. And when RBAC is enabled on the cluster,
the ServiceAccount that is used to run the application needs to have the proper permissions for such access.

A secret named `mydb` could contain username and passwords to connect to a database such as:

[source,properties]
----
myhost = killroy
myport = 5555
myuser = scott
mypass = tiger
----

This can be used in Camel with for example the Postrgres Sink Kamelet:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:rome"/>
    <setBody>
      <constant>{ "username":"oscerd", "city":"Rome"}</constant>
    </setBody>
    <to uri="kamelet:postgresql-sink?serverName={{secret:mydb/myhost}}
             &amp;serverPort={{secret:mydb/myport}}
             &amp;username={{secret:mydb/myuser}}
             &amp;password={{secret:mydb/mypass}}
             &amp;databaseName=cities
             &amp;query=INSERT INTO accounts (username,city) VALUES (:#username,:#city)"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

The postgres-sink Kamelet can also be configured in `application.properties` which reduces the configuration
in the route above:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.databaseName={{secret:mydb/myhost}}
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.serverPort={{secret:mydb/myport}}
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.username={{secret:mydb/myuser}}
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.password={{secret:mydb/mypass}}
----

Which reduces the route to:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:rome"/>
    <setBody>
      <constant>{ "username":"oscerd", "city":"Rome"}</constant>
    </setBody>
    <to uri="kamelet:postgresql-sink?databaseName=cities
             &amp;query=INSERT INTO accounts (username,city) VALUES (:#username,:#city)"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

==== Using configmap or secrets in local-mode

During development you may want to run in _local mode_ where you do not need acces to a Kubernetes cluster, to lookup the configmap.
In the local mode, then Camel will lookup the configmap _keys_ from local properties, eg:

For example the example above with the postgresql kamelet, that was configured using a secret:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.databaseName={{secret:mydb/myhost}}
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.serverPort={{secret:mydb/myport}}
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.username={{secret:mydb/myuser}}
camel.component.kamelet.postgresql-sink.password={{secret:mydb/mypass}}
----

Now suppose we have a local Postrgres database we want to use, then we can turn on _local mode_
and specify the credentials in the same properties file:

[source,properties]
----
camel.kubernetes-config.local-mode = true
mydb/myhost=localhost
mydb/myport=1234
mydb/myuser=scott
mydb/mypass=tiger
----

NOTE: Notice how the key is prefixed with the name of the secret and a slash, eg `name/key`. This makes it easy to copy/paste
from the actual use of the configmap/secret and into the `application.properties` file.

=== Using custom property placeholder functions

The xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component allow to plugin 3rd party functions which can be used during parsing of the property placeholders.
These functions are then able to do custom logic to resolve the placeholders, such as looking up in databases, do custom computations, or whatnot.
The name of the function becomes the prefix used in the placeholder.

This is best illustrated in the example route below, where we use `beer` as the prefix:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="{{beer:FOO}}"/>
    <to uri="{{beer:BAR}}"/>
</route>
----

The implementation of the function is only two methods as shown below:

[source,java]
----
@org.apache.camel.spi.annotations.PropertiesFunction("beer")
public class MyBeerFunction implements PropertiesFunction {

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "beer";
    }

    @Override
    public String apply(String remainder) {
        return "mock:" + remainder.toLowerCase();
    }
}
----

The function must implement the `org.apache.camel.spi.PropertiesFunction` interface.
The method `getName` is the name of the function (beer).
And the `apply` method is where we implement the custom logic to do.
As the sample code is from a unit test, it just returns a value to refer to a mock endpoint.

You also need to have `camel-component-maven-plugin` as part of building the component will
then ensure that this custom properties function has necessary source code generated that makes Camel
able to automatically discover the function.

NOTE: If the custom properties function need logic to startup and shutdown, then the function can extend `ServiceSupport`
and have this logic in `doStart` and `doStop` methods.

TIP: For an example see the `camel-base64` component.

== Using third party property sources

The properties component allows to plugin 3rd party sources to load and lookup properties via the `PropertySource`
API from camel-api.

The regular `PropertySource` will lookup the property on-demand,
for example to lookup values from a backend source such as a database or HashiCorp Vault etc.

A `PropertySource` can define that it supports loading all its properties
(by implementing `LoadablePropertiesSource`) from the source at once, for example from file system.
This allows Camel properties component to load these properties at once during startup.

For example the `camel-microprofile-config` component is implemented using this.
The 3rd-party `PropertySource` can automatically be discovered from classpath when Camel is starting up.
This is done by including the file `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/property-source-factory` which refers to the fully qualified class name of the `PropertySource` implementation.

See xref:components:others:microprofile-config.adoc[MicroProfile Config] component as an example.

You can also register 3rd-party property sources via Java API:

[source,java]
----
PropertiesComponent pc = context.getPropertiesComponent();
pc.addPropertiesSource(myPropertySource);
----
