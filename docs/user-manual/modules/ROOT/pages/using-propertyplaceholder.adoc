= Property placeholders

Camel has extensive support for property placeholders, which
can be used _almost anywhere_ in your Camel xref:routes.adoc[routes],
xref:endpoint.adoc[endpoints], xref:dsl.adoc[DSL], and xref:route-configuration.adoc[route configuration],
xref:bean-integration.adoc[bean integration] and elsewhere.

Property placeholders are used to define a _placeholder_ instead of the actual value.
This is important as you would want to be able to make your applications external
configurable, such as values for network addresses, port numbers, authentication credentials,
login tokens, and configuration in general.

== Properties component

Camel provides the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] out of the box
from the core, which is responsible for handling and resolving the property placeholders.

See the xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] documentation for how
to configure Camel to known from which location(a) to load properties.


== Property placeholder syntax

The value of a Camel property can be obtained by specifying its key name
within a property placeholder, using the following syntax: `{\{key}}`

For example:

[source,text]
----
{{file.uri}}
----

where `file.uri` is the property key.

Property placeholders can be used to specify parts, or all, of an
endpoint's URI by embedding one or more placeholders in the URI's string
definition.

=== Using property placeholder with default value

You can specify a default value to use if a
property with the key does not exist, where the default value is the text after the colon:

[source,text]
----
{{file.url:/some/path}}
----

In this case the default value is `/some/path`.

=== Using optional property placeholders

Camel's elaborate property placeholder feature supports optional placeholders,
which is defined with the `?` (question mark) as prefix in the key name, as shown:

[source,text]
----
{{?myBufferSize}}
----

If a value for the key exists then the value is used, however if the key does not exists,
then Camel understands this, such as when used in xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoints]:

[source,text]
----
file:foo?bufferSize={{?myBufferSize}}
----

Then the `bufferSize` option will only be configured in the endpoint, if a placeholder exists.
Otherwise the option will not be set on the endpoint, meaning the endpoint would be _restructued_ as:

[source,text]
----
file:foo
----

Then the option `bufferSize` is not in specified at all, and this would allow Camel to
use the standard default value for `bufferSize` if any exists.

=== Reverse a boolean value

If a property placeholder is a boolean value, then it is possible to negate (reverse) the value by using `!` as prefix in the key.

[source,properties]
----
integration.ftpEnabled=true
----

[source,java]
----
from("ftp:....").autoStartup("{{integration.ftpEnabled}}")
    .to("kafka:cheese")

from("jms:....").autoStartup("{{!integration.ftpEnabled}}")
    .to("kafka:cheese")
----

In the example above then the FTP route or the JMS route should only be started. So if the FTP is enabled then JMS should be disable, and vise-versa.
We can do this be negating the `autoStartup` in the JMS route, by using `!integration.ftpEnabled` as the key.


== Using property placeholders

When using property placeholders in the endpoint xref:uris.adoc[URIs] you should use this with the syntax `{\{key}}` as shown in this example:

[source,properties]
----
cool.end = mock:result
where = cheese
----

And in Java DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("{{cool.end}}");
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="{{cool.end}}"/>
</route>
----

A property placeholder may also just be a one part in the endpoint URI.
A common use-case is to use a placeholder for an endpoint option such
as the size of the write buffer in the file endpoint:

[source,properties]
----
buf = 8192
----

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("file:outbox?bufferSize={{buf}}");
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="file:outbox?bufferSize={{buf}}"/>
</route>
----

However the placeholder can be anywhere, so it could also be the name of a mock endpoint

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start")
    .to("mock:{{where}}");
----

In the example above the mock endpoint, is already hardcoded to start with `mock:`,
and the `where` placeholder has the value `cheese` so the resolved uri becomes `mock:cheese`.

=== Property placeholders referring to other properties

You can also have properties with refer to each other such as:

[source,properties]
----
cool.foo=result
cool.concat=mock:{{cool.foo}}
----

Notice how `cool.concat` refer to another property.

And the route in XML:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <to uri="{{cool.concat}}"/>
</route>
----

=== Using property placeholders multiple times

You can of couse also use placeholders several times:

[source,properties]
----
cool.start=direct:start
cool.showid=true
cool.result=result
----

And in this route we use `cool.start` two times:

[source,java]
----
from("{{cool.start}}")
    .to("log:{{cool.start}}?showBodyType=false&showExchangeId={{cool.showid}}")
    .to("mock:{{cool.result}}");
----

=== Using property placeholders with producer template

You can also your property placeholders when using
xref:producertemplate.adoc[ProducerTemplate] for example:

[source,java]
----
template.sendBody("{{cool.start}}", "Hello World");
----

=== Using property placeholders with consumer template

This can also be done when using xref:consumertemplate.adoc[ConsumerTemplate], such as:

[source,java]
----
Object body = template.receiveBody("{{cool.start}}");
----

== Resolving property placeholders from Java code

If you need to resolve property placeholder(s) from some Java code, then Camel has two APIs for this:

- You can use the method `resolveProperty` on the `PropertiesComponent` to resolve a single property from Java code.
- Use the method `resolvePropertyPlaceholders` on the `CamelContext` to resolve (one or more) property placeholder(s) in a String.

For example to resolve a placeholder with key foo, you can do:

[source,java]
----
Optional<String> prop = camelContext.getPropertiesComponent().resolveProperty("foo");
if (prop.isPresent()) {
    String value = prop.get();
    ....
}
----

This API is to lookup a single property and returns a `java.util.Optional` type.

The `CamelContext` have another API which is capable of resolving multiple placeholders, and interpolate placeholders from an input String.
Lets try with an example to explain this:

[source,java]
----
String msg = camelContext.resolvePropertyPlaceholders("{{greeting}} Camel user, Camel is {{cool}} dont you think?");
----

The input string is a text statement which have two placeholders that will be resolved, for example:

[source,properties]
----
greeting = Hi
cool = awesome
----

Will be resolved to:

[source,text]
----
Hi Camel user, Camel is awesome dont you think?
----

== Using property placeholders for any kind of attribute in Spring XML files

Previously it was only the `xs:string` type attributes in the XML DSL
that support placeholders. For example often a timeout attribute would
be a `xs:int` type and thus you cannot set a string value as the
placeholder key. This is now possible using a special
placeholder namespace.

In the example below we use the `prop` prefix for the namespace
`\http://camel.apache.org/schema/placeholder`. Now we can use `prop:` as prefix
to configure any kind of XML attributes in Spring XML files.

In the example below we want to use a placeholder for the `stopOnException` option in
the xref:components:eips:multicast-eip.adoc[Multicast] EIP. The `stopOnException` is a `xs:boolean` type,
so we cannot configure this as:

[source,xml]
----
<multicast stopOnException="{{stop}}">
   ...
</multicast>
----

Instead, we must use the `prop:` namespace, so we must add this namespace
in the top of the XML file in the `<beans>` tag.

To configure the option we must then use the `prop:optionName` as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<multicast prop:stopOnException="stop">
  ...
</multicast>
----

The complete example is below:

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:prop="http://camel.apache.org/schema/placeholder"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd">

    <bean id="damn" class="java.lang.IllegalArgumentException">
        <constructor-arg index="0" value="Damn"/>
    </bean>

    <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
        <propertyPlaceholder id="properties" location="classpath:myprop.properties"/>
        <route>
            <from uri="direct:start"/>
            <!-- use prop namespace, to define a property placeholder, which maps to option stopOnException={{stop}} -->
            <multicast prop:stopOnException="stop">
                <to uri="mock:a"/>
                <throwException ref="damn"/>
                <to uri="mock:b"/>
            </multicast>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
</beans>
----

In our properties file we have the value defined as:

[source,properties]
----
stop = true
----


== Bridging Camel property placeholders with Spring XML files

NOTE: If you are using Spring Boot then this does not apply.
This is only for legacy Camel and Spring applications which are using Spring XML files.

The Spring Framework does not allow third-party frameworks such as
Apache Camel to seamless hook into the Spring property placeholder
mechanism. However, you can bridge Spring and Camel by declaring a
Spring bean with the type
`org.apache.camel.spring.spi.BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`,
which is a Spring
`org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`
type.

To bridge Spring and Camel you must define a single bean as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- bridge spring property placeholder with Camel -->
<!-- you must NOT use the <context:property-placeholder at the same time, only this bridge bean -->
<bean id="bridgePropertyPlaceholder" class="org.apache.camel.spring.spi.BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
  <property name="location" value="classpath:org/apache/camel/component/properties/cheese.properties"/>
</bean>
----

You *must not* use the spring `<context:property-placeholder>` namespace
at the same time; this is not possible.

After declaring this bean, you can define property placeholders using
both the Spring style, and the Camel style within the `<camelContext>`
tag as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- a bean that uses Spring property placeholder -->
<!-- the ${hi} is a spring property placeholder -->
<bean id="hello" class="org.apache.camel.component.properties.HelloBean">
  <property name="greeting" value="${hi}"/>
</bean>

<camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <!-- in this route we use Camels property placeholder {{ }} style -->
  <route>
    <from uri="direct:{{cool.bar}}"/>
    <bean ref="hello"/>
    <to uri="{{cool.end}}"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----

Notice how the hello bean is using pure Spring property placeholders using
the `${}` notation. And in the Camel routes we use the Camel
placeholder notation with `{\{key}}`.

== Using property placeholder functions

The xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component includes the following functions out of the box:

* `env` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables
* `sys` - A function to lookup the property from Java JVM system properties
* `service` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom
* `service.name` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom returning the hostname part only
* `service.port` - A function to lookup the property from OS environment variables using the service naming idiom returning the port part only

These functions are intended to make it easy to lookup values from the environment, as shown in the example below:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{env:SOMENAME}}"/>
        <to uri="{{sys:MyJvmPropertyName}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

You can use default values as well, so if the property does not exist, you can define a default value as shown below, where the default value is a `log:foo` and `log:bar` value.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="{{env:SOMENAME:log:foo}}"/>
        <to uri="{{sys:MyJvmPropertyName:log:bar}}"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

The service function is for looking up a service which is defined using OS environment variables using the service naming idiom, to refer to a service location using `hostname : port`

* __NAME__**_SERVICE_HOST**
* __NAME__**_SERVICE_PORT**

in other words the service uses `_SERVICE_HOST` and `_SERVICE_PORT` as prefix.
So if the service is named FOO, then the OS environment variables should be set as

[source,bash]
----
export $FOO_SERVICE_HOST=myserver
export $FOO_SERVICE_PORT=8888
----

For example if the FOO service a remote HTTP service, then we can refer to the service in the Camel endpoint uri, and use the HTTP component to make the HTTP call:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
    <route>
        <from uri="direct:start"/>
        <to uri="http://{{service:FOO}}/myapp"/>
    </route>
</camelContext>
----

And we can use default values if the service has not been defined, for example to call a service on localhost, maybe for unit testing.

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext>
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="http://{{service:FOO:localhost:8080}}/myapp"/>
</route>
</camelContext>
----

=== Using custom property placeholder functions

The xref:components::properties-component.adoc[Properties] component allow to plugin 3rd party functions which can be used during parsing of the property placeholders.
These functions are then able to do custom logic to resolve the placeholders, such as looking up in databases, do custom computations, or whatnot.
The name of the function becomes the prefix used in the placeholder.

This is best illustrated in the example route below, where we use `beer` as the prefix:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <to uri="{{beer:FOO}}"/>
    <to uri="{{beer:BAR}}"/>
</route>
----

The implementation of the function is only two methods as shown below:

[source,java]
----
@org.apache.camel.spi.annotations.PropertiesFunction("beer")
public class MyBeerFunction implements PropertiesFunction {

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "beer";
    }

    @Override
    public String apply(String remainder) {
        return "mock:" + remainder.toLowerCase();
    }
}
----

The function must implement the `org.apache.camel.spi.PropertiesFunction` interface.
The method `getName` is the name of the function (beer).
And the `apply` method is where we implement the custom logic to do.
As the sample code is from a unit test, it just returns a value to refer to a mock endpoint.

You also need to have `camel-component-maven-plugin` as part of building the component will
then ensure that this custom properties function has necessary source code generated that makes Camel
able to automatically discover the function.

NOTE: If the custom properties function need logic to startup and shutdown, then the function can extend `ServiceSupport`
and have this logic in `doStart` and `doStop` methods.

TIP: For an example see the `camel-base64` component.

== Using third party property sources

The properties component allows to plugin 3rd party sources to load and lookup properties via the `PropertySource`
API from camel-api.

The regular `PropertySource` will lookup the property on-demand,
for example to lookup values from a backend source such as a database or HashiCorp Vault etc.

A `PropertySource` can define that it supports loading all its properties
(by implementing `LoadablePropertiesSource`) from the source at once, for example from file system.
This allows Camel properties component to load these properties at once during startup.

For example the `camel-microprofile-config` component is implemented using this.
The 3rd-party `PropertySource` can automatically be discovered from classpath when Camel is starting up.
This is done by including the file `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/property-source-factory` which refers to the fully qualified class name of the `PropertySource` implementation.

See xref:components:others:microprofile-config.adoc[MicroProfile Config] component as an example.

You can also register 3rd-party property sources via Java API:

[source,java]
----
PropertiesComponent pc = context.getPropertiesComponent();
pc.addPropertiesSource(myPropertySource);
----
