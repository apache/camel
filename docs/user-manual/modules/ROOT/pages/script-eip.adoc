[[script-eip]]
== Script EIP
*Available as of Camel 2.16*

Is used to execute a script which does not change the message (by default).
This is useful when you need to invoke some logic that are not in Java code such as JavaScript,
Groovy or any of the other Languages. The message body is not changed (by default) however the scripting
context has access to the current Exchange and can essentially change the message or headers directly.
But the return value from the script is discarded and not used.
If the return value should be used as a changed message body then use link:./message-translator.adoc[Message Translator] EIP instead.

=== Options

// eip options: START
The Script EIP has no options.
// eip options: END

=== Samples
The route below will read the file contents and validate them against a regular expression.

[source,java]
----
from("file://inbox")
  .script().groovy("// some groovy code goes here")
  .to("bean:MyServiceBean.processLine");
----

And from XML its easy as well

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file://inbox"/>
  <script>
    <groovy>// some groovy code goes here</groovy>
  </script>
  <beanRef ref="myServiceBean" method="processLine"/>
</route>

<bean id="myServiceBean" class="com.mycompany.MyServiceBean"/>
----

Mind that you can use _CDATA_ in XML if the groovy scrip uses `< >` etc

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file://inbox"/>
  <script>
    <groovy><![CDATA[ some groovy script here that can be multiple lines and whatnot ]]></groovy>
  </script>
  <beanRef ref="myServiceBean" method="processLine"/>
</route>

<bean id="myServiceBean" class="com.mycompany.MyServiceBean"/>
----

=== Using external script files
You can refer to external script files instead of inlining the script.
For example to load a groovy script from the classpath you need to prefix the value with `resource:` as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file://inbox"/>
  <script>
    <groovy>resource:classpath:com/foo/myscript.groovy</groovy>
  </script>
  <beanRef ref="myServiceBean" method="processLine"/>
</route>

<bean id="myServiceBean" class="com.mycompany.MyServiceBean"/>
----

You can also refer to the script from the file system with `file:` instead of `classpath:`
such as `file:/var/myscript.groovy`
