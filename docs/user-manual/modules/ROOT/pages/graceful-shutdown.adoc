= Graceful Shutdown

Camel supports a pluggable shutdown strategy using
`org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy`. Its responsible for shutting
down routes in a graceful manner. The other resources will still be
handled by xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] to shutdown. This leaves
the problem at hand with properly shutting down all the routes reliably
to the `ShutdownStrategy`.

Camel provides a default strategy in the
`org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultShutdownStrategy` which is capable of
doing that.

== Default Shutdown Strategy

The default strategy (`DefaultShutdownStrategy`) will gracefully shutdown routes:

* in the reverse order they were started
* let pending and current in flight exchanges run to completion before
shutting down
* using a timeout of 45 seconds which then forces a _hard_ shutdown

The settings are configurable, so you can change the timeout, and
whether in case of timeout to force a _hard_ shutdown or ignore.

When shutting down the strategy will output to log the progress:

[source,log]
---------------------------------
2009-12-20 10:56:53,055 [main ] INFO DefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel (CamelContext:camel-1) is stopping
2009-12-20 10:56:53,056 [main ] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy - Starting to graceful shutdown routes (timeout 45 seconds)

2009-12-20 10:56:58,077 [main ] INFO DefaultCamelContext - Apache Camel (CamelContext:camel-1) stopped
---------------------------------

Notice how the strategy waits while there are inflight exchanges still being
processed before it shutdown the routes and after that Camel itself.

=== Suppressing logging due to timeout not allowing all inflight messages to complete

If a graceful shutdown could not shutdown cleanly within the given
timeout period, then Camel performs a more aggressive shutdown (hard) by
forcing routes and thread pools etc to shut down, and the routing
engine will reject continue processing xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange]s. If
this happens you may see WARN logs about xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange]s
being rejected and other failures due the forced shutdown.

If you do not want to see these logs, you can suppress this by setting
the option suppressLoggingOnTimeout to true.

[source,java]
---------------------------------
context.getShutdownStrategy().setSuppressLoggingOnTimeout(true);
---------------------------------

Notice that suppression is _a best effort_ attempt and there may still be some
logging from 3rd party libraries, which Camel cannot control.

=== Logging inflight exchange information on timeout

If a graceful shutdown could not shutdown cleanly within the given
timeout period, then Camel performs a more aggressive shutdown by
forcing routes and thread pools etc to shut down. When the timeout
happens, then Camel logs information about the current inflight
exchanges, which shows from which route the exchange origins, and where
it currently is being routed. For example the logging below, shows that
there is 1 inflight exchange, that origins from route1, and currently is
still in route1 at the "delay1" node. The elapsed is time in millis how
long at the current node (eg delay1) and duration is total time in
mills.

If you enable DEBUG logging level
on `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultShutdownStrategy` then it logs the same
inflight exchange information during graceful shutdown

[source,log]
---------------------------------
2015-01-12 13:23:23,656 [ - ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy -
There are 1 inflight exchanges: InflightExchange:
[exchangeId=ID-davsclaus-air-62213-1421065401253-0-3,
fromRouteId=route1, routeId=route1, nodeId=delay1, elapsed=2007,
duration=2017]
---------------------------------

If you do not want to see these logs, you can turn this off by setting
the option logInflightExchangesOnTimeout to false.

[source,java]
---------------------------------
context.getShutdownStrategy().setLogInflightExchangesOnTimeout(false);
---------------------------------

=== JMX managed

The `ShutdownStrategy` is JMX aware, so you can manage it from a
JMX console. This allows to adjust the strategy at runtime, such as changing the timeout setting.

== Controlling ordering of routes

You can configure the order in which routes should be started, and thus
also the same order they are being shutdown.
 See more at
xref:configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.adoc[Configuring
route startup ordering and autostartup].

== Fine grained configuration

You can control two areas that influence graceful shutdown in the Camel
routing:

* `ShutdownRoute`
* `ShutdownRunningTask`

These options can be configured on two levels: _context_ and _route_.
The route level take precedence over context, meaning that if not
explicit configured on the route level, then the context level is used.

=== ShutdownRoute

This option can control how a given route should act during graceful
shutdown. It has two values `Default` and `Defer`. The `Default` is
obviously the default option which lets Camel shutdown the route as
early as possible. The `Defer` is used to defer shutting down this route
to a later stage. This is useful when other routes are dependent upon
it. For example an internal route which other routes reuse.

NOTE: It is best to only defer shutting down internal routes only. Public
routes should shut down as quickly as possible otherwise it will just
keep intake new messages which will delay the shutdown processor. Or
even have it timeout if a lot of new messages keep coming in.

=== ShutdownRunningTask

This option control how a given route consumer acts during shutdown.
Most route consumer will only operate on a single task (message),
however the xref:batch-consumer.adoc[Batch Consumer] can operate on many
messages (in a batch). This option is for batch consumers.

The default value is `CompleteCurrentTaskOnly` which mean that the
current _in progress_ task (message) will be completed and then the
consumer will shut down. The other option `CompleteAllTasks` allows the
consumer to complete all the tasks (messages) before shutting down. For
example a xref:components::file-component.adoc[File] consumer will process all the pending
files it has picked up before shutting down.

== Stop individual routes

It is possible to stop (will do a gracefully shut down) an individual route using
`stopRoute(routeId)` method as shown:

[source,java]
----
camelContext.getRouteController().stopRoute(routeId);
----

Routes can also be stopped via JMX.

=== Stopping and marking routes as failed due to an exception

It is possible to stop and fail (will do a gracefully shut down) an individual route using
`stopRoute(routeId, cause)` method as shown:

[source,java]
----
Exception cause = ...
camelContext.getRouteController().stopRoute(routeId, cause);
----

This will stop the route and then mark the route as failed with the caused exception.

NOTE: The Camel xref:health-check.adoc[Health Check] detect the route as failed and report it as DOWN.
If the route is manually stopped, then the route is not marked as failed,
and the xref:health-check.adoc[Health Check] will report the status as UNKNOWN.

Routes can also be stopped and failed via JMX.

== Implementing custom component or ShutdownStrategy

If you develop your own Camel component or want to implement your own
shutdown strategy then read this section for details.

=== ShutdownStrategy

You can implement your own strategy to control the shutdown by
implementing the `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy` and the set it
on the `CamelContext` using the `setShutdownStrategy` method.

=== ShutdownAware

The interface `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownAware` is an optional
interface consumers can implement to have fine grained control during
shutdown. The `ShutdownStrategy` must be able to deal with consumers
which implement this interface. This interface was introduced to cater
for in memory consumers such as xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] which potentially
have a number of pending messages on its internal in memory queues. What
this allows is to let it control the shutdown process to let it complete
its pending messages.

The method `getPendingExchangesSize` should return the number of pending
messages which reside on the in memory queues.
The method `deferShutdown` should return `true` to defer the shutdown
to a later stage, when there are no more pending and inflight messages.

xref:batch-consumer.adoc[Batch Consumer] should implement
`ShutdownAware` so they properly support the `ShutdownRunningTask`
option. See `GenericFileConsumer` for an example.
