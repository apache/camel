[[GracefulShutdown-GracefulShutdown]]
= Graceful Shutdown

Camel supports a pluggable shutdown strategy using
`org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy`. Its responsible for shutting
down routes in a graceful manner. The other resources will still be
handled by xref:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] to shutdown. This leaves
the problem at hand with properly shutting down all the routes in a
reliable manner to the `ShutdownStrategy`.

Camel provides a default strategy in the
`org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultShutdownStrategy` which is capable of
doing that.

[[GracefulShutdown-DefaultShutdownStrategy]]
== DefaultShutdownStrategy

The default strategy will gracefully shutdown routes:

* in the reverse order they was started. The option
`shutdownRoutesInReverseOrder` can be used to use the old behavior.
* let pending and current in flight exchanges run to completion before
shutting down
* using a timeout of 45 seconds which then forces a shutdown now

You can configure the timeout, and whether it should shutdown now
remaining routes when the timeout occurred or ignore. See the setters on
the class.

It will output to log the progress during graceful shutdown as shown in
an example below

[source,bash]

---------------------------------

Notice how it waits while there are inflight exchanges still being
processed before it can shutdown.

[[GracefulShutdown-Suppressingloggingduetotimeoutnotallowingallinflightmessagestocomplete]]
== Suppressing logging due to timeout not allowing all inflight messages to complete

If a graceful shutdown could not shutdown cleanly within the given
timeout period, then Camel performs a more aggressive shutdown by
forcing routes and thread pools etc to shutdown. And as well the routing
engine will reject continue processing xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange]s. If
this happens you may see WARN logs about xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange]s
being rejected and other failures due the forced shutdown.

If you do not want to see these logs, you can suppress this by setting
the option SuppressLoggingOnTimeout to true.

[source,java]
---------------------------------
context.getShutdownStrategy().setSuppressLoggingOnTimeout(true);
---------------------------------

Notice the suppress is a "best effort" though there may still be some
logs coming from 3rd party libraries and whatnot, which Camel cannot
control.

[[GracefulShutdown-Logginginflightexchangeinformationontimeout]]
== Logging inflight exchange information on timeout

If a graceful shutdown could not shutdown cleanly within the given
timeout period, then Camel performs a more aggressive shutdown by
forcing routes and thread pools etc to shutdown. When the timeout
happens, then Camel logs information about the current inflight
exchanges, which shows from which route the exchange origins, and where
it currently is being routed. For example the logging below, shows that
there is 1 inflight exchange, that origins from route1, and currently is
still in route1 at the "delay1" node. The elapsed is time in millis how
long at the current node (eg delay1) and duration is total time in
mills.

If you enable DEBUG logging level
on `org.apache.camel.impl.engine.DefaultShutdownStrategy` then it logs the same
inflight exchange information during graceful shutdown

[source,bash]
---------------------------------
2015-01-12 13:23:23,656 [ - ShutdownTask] INFO DefaultShutdownStrategy -
There are 1 inflight exchanges: InflightExchange:
[exchangeId=ID-davsclaus-air-62213-1421065401253-0-3,
fromRouteId=route1, routeId=route1, nodeId=delay1, elapsed=2007,
duration=2017]
---------------------------------

If you do not want to see these logs, you can turn this off by setting
the option logInflightExchangesOnTimeout to false.

[source,java]
---------------------------------
context.getShutdownStrategy().setLogInflightExchangesOnTimeout(false);
---------------------------------

[[GracefulShutdown-Controllingorderingofroutes]]
== Controlling ordering of routes

You can configure the order in which routes should be started, and thus
also the same order they are being shutdown.
 See more at
xref:configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.adoc[Configuring
route startup ordering and autostartup].

[[GracefulShutdown-Finegrainedconfiguration]]
== Fine grained configuration

You can control two areas that influence graceful shutdown in the Camel
routing:

* `ShutdownRoute`
* `ShutdownRunningTask`

These options can be configured on two scopes: `context` and `route`.
Where a route will fallback to the `context` scoped option, if not
explicit configured. (same principle as xref:error-handler.adoc[Error
Handler], etc.).

[[GracefulShutdown-ShutdownRoute]]
== ShutdownRoute

This option can control how a given route should act during graceful
shutdown. It has two values `Default` and `Defer`. The `Default` is
obviously the default option which lets Camel shutdown the route as
early as possible. The `Defer` is used to defer shutting down this route
to a later stage. This is useful when other routes are dependent upon
it. For example an internal route which other routes reuse.

For example in the route below we have two routes, where route 1 is
dependent upon route 2. At shutdown we want route 1 to complete all its
current messages and we also want the 2nd route to do this as well. So
we can mark both routes to `Defer` but since route 1 is a
xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] based route its `Defer` by default (it uses
`ShutdownAware`).

A Java DSL based example to defer shutting down the 2nd:

---------------------------------

Defer shutting down internal routes only

Its best to only defer shutting down internal routes only. As *public*
routes should shutdown as quickly as possible otherwise it will just
keep intake new messages which will delay the shutdown processor. Or
even have it timeout if a lot of new messages keep coming in.

[[GracefulShutdown-ShutdownRunningTask]]
== ShutdownRunningTask

This option control how a given route consumer acts during shutdown.
Most route consumer will only operate on a single task (message),
however the xref:batch-consumer.adoc[Batch Consumer] can operate on many
messages (in a batch). This option is for those kind of consumers. By
default it uses the option `CompleteCurrentTaskOnly` which mean that the
current _in progress_ task (message) will be completed and then the
consumer will shutdown. The other option `CompleteAllTasks` allows the
consumer to complete all the tasks (messages) before shutting down. For
example a xref:components::file-component.adoc[File] consumer will process all the pending
files it has picked up before shutting down.

---------------------------------

[[GracefulShutdown-JMXmanaged]]
== JMX managed

The `ShutdownStrategy` is JMX aware as well so you can manage it from a
JMX console. For example you can change the timeout value.

[[GracefulShutdown-Shuttingdownindividualroutes]]
== Shutting down individual routes

It is possible to gracefully shutdown an individual route using
`shutdownRoute(routeId)` method on `CamelContext`. Its also possible to
provide a specific timeout to use instead of the default timeout
settings using `shutdownRoute(routeId, timeout, timeUnit)`.

[[GracefulShutdown-Developerrelated]]
== Developer related

If you develop your own Camel component or want to implement your own
shutdown strategy then read this section for details.

[[GracefulShutdown-ShutdownStrategy]]
== ShutdownStrategy

You can implement your own strategy to control the shutdown by
implementing the `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy` and the set it
on the `CamelContext` using the `setShutdownStrategy` method.

When using Spring XML you then just define a spring bean which
implements the `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy` and Camel will
look it up at startup and use it instead of its default. See more at
xref:advanced-configuration-of-camelcontext-using-spring.adoc[Advanced
configuration of CamelContext using Spring].

[[GracefulShutdown-ShutdownAware]]
== ShutdownAware

The interface `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownAware` is an optional
interface consumers can implement to have fine grained control during
shutdown. The `ShutdownStrategy` must be able to deal with consumers
which implement this interface. This interface was introduced to cater
for in memory consumers such as xref:components::seda-component.adoc[SEDA] which potentially
have a number of pending messages on its internal in memory queues. What
this allows is to let it control the shutdown process to let it complete
its pending messages.

The method `getPendingExchangesSize` should return the number of pending
messages which reside on the in memory queues. +
 The method `deferShutdown` should return `true` to defer the shutdown
to a later stage, when there are no more pending and inflight messages.

xref:batch-consumer.adoc[Batch Consumer] should implement
`ShutdownAware` so they properly support the `ShutdownRunningTask`
option. See `GenericFileConsumer` for an example.


== See Also

When Camel is starting up, then its xref:route-controller.adoc[Route Controller]
that handles this to ensure all the routes are started with support for managing
troublesome routes with restaring.
