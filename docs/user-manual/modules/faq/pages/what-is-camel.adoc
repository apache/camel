= What is Camel?

Apache Camel (TM) is a versatile open-source integration framework based on
known xref:components:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

Camel empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of
domain-specific languages (xref:manual::dsl.adoc[DSL], such as Java, XML, and YAML).
This means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE.

Apache Camel uses xref:ROOT:uris.adoc[URIs] to work directly with any kind of
transport or messaging model such as
xref:components::http-component.adoc[HTTP], xref:components::kafka-component.adoc[Kafka], xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS],
xref:components::netty-component.adoc[Netty] or xref:components::aws2-s3-component.adoc[AWS S3], as
well as pluggable xref:ROOT:component.adoc[Components] and
xref:ROOT:data-format.adoc[Data Format] options. Apache Camel is a small
library with minimal xref:ROOT:what-are-the-dependencies.adoc[dependencies]
for easy embedding in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work
with the same xref:ROOT:exchange.adoc[API] regardless which kind of
transport is used -- so learn the API once and you
can interact with all the xref:components::index.adoc[Components] provided
out-of-box.

Apache Camel provides support for xref:ROOT:bean-binding.adoc[Bean Binding]
and seamless integration with popular frameworks such as
xref:ROOT:spring.adoc[Spring]. Camel also has extensive support for
xref:ROOT:testing.adoc[unit testing] your routes.

A highly recommended video introducing Apache Camel and the concepts is a must to watch to get familiar and higher success of learning to use Camel:
