= Is it possible to start Camel as a standalone application, without embedding it in another application?

Yes, Camel can run standalone or in any container. Running Standalone is
as simple just to create a xref:ROOT:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext], add
routes and start it. If you don't want to write your own Java main, you
could use the one from xref:ROOT:spring.adoc[camel-spring]
(https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-spring/current/index.html) also used
by the xref:ROOT:camel-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Maven Plugin].

The starting guide is a good place to start: +
xref:ROOT:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started]

And the concrete walk through a plain old java main example: +
xref:ROOT:walk-through-an-example.adoc[Walk through an Example]

The FAQ have some more details: +
xref:index.adoc[FAQ]

And if you use Maven for your projects Camel has maven tools to boot up
in standalone mode and quickly run you Camel application: +
xref:ROOT:camel-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel Maven Plugin]

This is how you can run the xref:ROOT:examples.adoc[Examples] that is
included in the Camel distribution.
