= If I use ServiceMix when should I use Camel?

Camel is a routing and mediation engine which works great inside JBI.

So if you are already using http://servicemix.apache.org/[ServiceMix]
then you can use Camel implement the
xref:{eip-vc}:eips:enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration Patterns]
inside JBI such as
xref:{eip-vc}:eips:content-based-router-eip.adoc[Content Based Router], routing messages
between your existing JBI endpoints.

You can also reuse any of the Camel xref:ROOT:component.adoc[Components]
within JBI or expose Camel endpoints as JBI endpoints.
