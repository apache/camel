= How do I debug my route?

If you've created a route and its not doing what you think it is you
could try using one of these features from version 1.4 onwards:

* xref:ROOT:tracer.adoc[Tracer] to trace in commons-logging / log4j each step
that Camel takes
* xref:ROOT:debugger.adoc[Debugger] to let you set breakpoints at points in
the route and examine historic message exchanges
* xref:ROOT:debugger.adoc[Debug] from your unit test if you use the Camel
`camel-test` component

Some xref:ROOT:user-stories.adoc[third party tools] offers Apache Camel route
debugging.
