= How do I use a big (uber) JAR?

If you want to repackage all the Camel JARs into a single uber JAR then
you can use the Maven shade plugin. But you have to ensure all the
service files get appended correctly. If you do this you are taking
responsible yourself for this.

See some example in this
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3773[CAMEL-3773] JIRA
ticket.
