= How do I invoke Camel routes from JBI?

When you use the JBI endpoint as follows:

[source,java]
----
from("jbi:endpoint:http://foo.bar.org/MyService/MyEndpoint")
----

you automatically expose the endpoint to the NMR bus where service qname
is:

----
{http://foo.bar.org}MyService
----

and endpoint name is `MyEndpoint`.

Then if you send a message via the JBI NMR to this JBI endpoint then it
will be sent to the above Camel route.

Sending works in the same way. You use:

[source,java]
----
to("jbi:endpoint:http://foo.bar.org/MyService/MyEndpoint") 
----

to send messages to JBI endpoint deployed to the bus.

I noticed that people are used to somehow 'declaring' endpoints in SMX.
In Camel it is enough to simply start a flow from a jbi endpoint and
Camel will create it automatically.
