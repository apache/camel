= How do I restart CamelContext?

A xref:ROOT:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] provides operations to control
its lifecycle, see more at xref:ROOT:camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext].

[NOTE]
====
Obviously you can also restart a Camel application if its been
deployed in a server. For example a WAR application can be restarted
using the usual means for managing web applications.
