= Using camel-core-tests.jar

The `camel-core-tests.jar` is *not* for usage for Camel end users. This
JAR is only used internally by Camel itself when it tests the same unit
tests using different DSL such as Spring XML, Blueprint XML, etc.

End users who need a test kit should use `camel-test`
JARs instead. See more here xref:ROOT:testing.adoc[Testing].
