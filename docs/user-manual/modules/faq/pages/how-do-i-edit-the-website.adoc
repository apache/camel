There are two ways to edit the website:

* In local repositories

== Directly on the GitHub website

The website pages can be edited on the GitHub website. It's a very quick process and ideal for fixing typos or updating information.

Steps to edit a file:

. Go to the page you want to edit.
. Look for a link called "Edit this Page" and click on it.
. Edit the file.
. Preview your changes.
. Provide a title and description for your pull request.
. Click on the "Propose file change" button.

== In local repositories

To edit files locally, it's important to understand how the website is generated and where the files are located. The https://github.com/apache/camel-website[site generator] is located in its own repository. The documentation is located in the main https://github.com/apache/camel[Apache Camel] repository and sub-project repositories, such as https://github.com/apache/camel-k[Camel-K] and https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus[Camel Quarkus]. Have a look at the xref:how-does-the-website-work.adoc[How does the website work?] page for more details.

Steps to edit a file:

. Fork and clone the https://github.com/apache/camel-website[site generator repository] and the Camel repository that contains the documentation you want to change.
. Follow the build instructions located in the site generator's https://github.com/apache/camel-website/blob/master/README.md[README file].
. Open Antora's https://github.com/apache/camel-website/blob/master/site.yml[`site.yml`] configuration file and change the content sources to https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.1/playbook/configure-content-sources/#local-urls[local repositories].
. Edit the file.
. Build the website.
. Preview your changes locally.
. Revert changes to `site.yml`.
. Push your changes to your forked repositories and send a pull request.

[NOTE]
====
It's a good idea to spend some time and learn how https://antora.org[Antora] and https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] work.
