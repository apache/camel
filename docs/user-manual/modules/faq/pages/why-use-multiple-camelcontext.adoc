= Why use multiple CamelContext?

In general, you don't tend to want multiple camel contexts in your
application, if you're running Camel as a standalone Java instance.
However, if you're deploying Camel routes as OSGi bundles, or WARs in an
application server, then you can end up having multiple routes being
deployed, each in it's own, isolated camel context, in the same JVM.
This makes sense: you want each Camel application to be deployable in
isolation, in it's own Application Context, and not affected by the
other Camel applications.

If you want the endpoints or producers in different camel contexts to
communicate with another, there are a number of solutions. You can use
the ServiceMix NMR, or you can use xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS], or
you can use Camel's xref:components::vm-component.adoc[VM] transport.
