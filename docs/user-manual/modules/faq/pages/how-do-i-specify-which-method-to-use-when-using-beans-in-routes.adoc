= Ho do I specify which method to use when using beans in routes?

See xref:components::bean-component.adoc[Bean], xref:ROOT:bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration]
and xref:ROOT:bean-binding.adoc[Bean Binding]

However if you have overloaded methods you need to specify which of
those overloaded method you want to use by specifying parameter type
qualifiers. See more details at xref:ROOT:bean-binding.adoc[Bean Binding].
