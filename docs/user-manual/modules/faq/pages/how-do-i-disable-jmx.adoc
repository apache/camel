= How do I disable JMX?

== How do I disable JMX in Camel 3.x

JMX is disabled by default, and only enabled if `camel-management`
is on the classpath. So an easy way to disable JMX is to _not_ include this JAR.

You can also turn off JMX as shown below.

== How do I disable JMX in Camel 2.x

You can disable JMX instrumentation agent by setting Java VM system
property as follow. The property value is treated as boolean.

[source,java]
----
-Dorg.apache.camel.jmx.disabled=true
----

Or, by adding a jmxAgent element inside the camelContext element in
Spring configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <jmxAgent id="agent" disabled="true"/>
    ...
</camelContext>
----

Or in Camel 2.1 its a bit easier (not having to use JVM system property)
if using pure Java as you can disable it as follows:

[source,java]
----
CamelContext camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
camel.disableJMX();
----
