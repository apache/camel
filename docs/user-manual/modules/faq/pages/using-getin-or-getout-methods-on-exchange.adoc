= Message Exchange Patterns and the Exchange object

The Camel API is influenced by APIs such as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Business_Integration[JBI specification],
http://cxf.apache.org/[CXF] which defines a concept
called Message Exchange Patterns (MEP for short).

The MEP defines the messaging style used such as one-way
(xref:{eip-vc}:eips:event-message.adoc[InOnly]) or request-reply
(xref:{eip-vc}:eips:request-reply.adoc[InOut]),
which means you have IN and optionally OUT messages. This closely maps
to other APIs such as WS, WSDL, REST, JBI and the likes.

The xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] API provides two methods to get a
message, either `getIn` or `getOut`.
Obviously the `getIn` gets the IN message, and the `getOut` gets the OUT
message.

== Flow of an exchange through a route

* The out message from each step is used as the in message for the next
step
* if there is no out message then the in message is used instead
* For the InOut MEP the out from the last step in the route is returned
to the producer. In case of InOnly the last out is thrown away

[TIP]
====
**Beware of `getOut` to check if there is an out message**

`exchange.getOut` creates an out message if there is none. So if you want
to check if there is an out message then you should use `exchange.hasOut`
instead.

== Using getIn or getOut methods on Exchange

Now suppose you want to use a Camel xref:processor.adoc[Processor] to
adjust a message. This can be done as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
    // change the message to say Hello
    exchange.getOut().setBody("Hello " + body);
}
----

This seems intuitive and is what you would expect is the _right_
approach to change a message from a xref:processor.adoc[Processor].
However there is an big issue -- the `getOut` method will create a new
xref:{eip-vc}:eips:message.adoc[Message], which means any other information
from the IN message will not be propagated; which means you will lose
that data.

To remedy this we'll have to copy the data which is done as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
    // change the message to say Hello
    exchange.getOut().setBody("Hello " + body);
    // copy headers from IN to OUT to propagate them
    exchange.getOut().setHeaders(exchange.getIn().getHeaders());
}
----

Well that is not all, a xref:{eip-vc}:eips:message.adoc[Message] can also contain
attachments so to be sure you need to propagate those as well:

[source,java]
----
public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
    // change the message to say Hello
    exchange.getOut().setBody("Hello " + body);
    // copy headers from IN to OUT to propagate them
    exchange.getOut().setHeaders(exchange.getIn().getHeaders();
    // copy attachements from IN to OUT to propagate them
    exchange.getOut().setAttachments(exchange.getIn().getAttachments());
}
----

Now we ensure that all additional data is propagated on the new OUT
message. But its a shame we need 2 code lines to ensure data is
propagated.
What you can do instead is to change the IN message instead, as shown
below:

[source,java]
----
public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
    String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
    // change the existing message to say Hello
    exchange.getIn().setBody("Hello " + body);
}
----

[TIP]
====
**Consider using getIn**

As shown above you most often need to alter the existing IN message,
than creating a totally new OUT message.
And therefore it's often easier just to adjust the IN message directly.
====

Changing the IN message directly is possible in Camel as it doesn't
mind. Camel will detect that the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] has no OUT
message and therefore use the IN message instead.

[[UsinggetInorgetOutmethodsonExchange-AboutMessageExchangePatternandgetOut]]
== About Message Exchange Pattern and getOut

If the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is using `InOnly` as the MEP, then
you may think that the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] has no OUT
message. But you can still invoke the `getOut` method on
xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange]; Camel will not barf.

So the example code above is possible for any kind of MEP. The MEP is
_just_ a flag on the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] which the Consumer and
Producer adhere to.
You can change the MEP on the xref:exchange.adoc[Exchange] using the
`setPattern` method. And likewise there is DSL to change it as well.
