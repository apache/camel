= How do I retry failed messages forever?

If you want to keep the bad message in the original queue, then you are
also blocking the messages that has arrived on the queue after the bad
message.

By default Camel will retry consuming a message up til 6 times before
its moved to the default dead letter queue.

If you configure the xref:{eip-vc}:eips:dead-letter-channel.adoc[Dead Letter Channel]
to use `maximumRedeliveries = -1` then Camel will retry forever.

When you consume a message you can check the in message header
`org.apache.camel.redeliveryCount` that contains the number of times it
has been redlivered.

Or `org.apache.camel.Redelivered` that contains a boolean if its
redelivered or if its the first time the message is processed.
