How Do I Make It Transactional?

[[HowDoIMakeMyJMSEndpointTransactional-Answer]]
== Answer:

There are examples in the xref:{eip-vc}:eips:transactional-client.adoc[Transactional Client]
and it is described in the _Enabling Transacted Consumption_
section of xref:components::jms-component.adoc[JMS]. To make a session transactional
set `transacted=true` flag on the JMS endpoint and configure
a `transactionManager` on the xref:component.adoc[Component] or
xref:endpoint.adoc[Endpoint].
