= How should I invoke my POJOs or Spring Services?

The various options are described in detail in
xref:ROOT:bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration], in particular the
xref:ROOT:bean-binding.adoc[Bean Binding] describes how we invoke a bean
inside a route.

See the xref:ROOT:pojo-consuming.adoc[POJO Consuming] for examples using
either the `@Consume` annotation or using the routing DSL:

[source,java]
----
from("jms:someQueue").bean(MyBean.class, "someMethod");
----
