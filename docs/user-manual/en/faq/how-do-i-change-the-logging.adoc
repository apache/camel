=== How do I change the logging?

We use https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/[commons-logging] to
log information in the broker client and the broker itself so you can
fully configure the logging levels desired, whether to log to files or
the console, as well as the underlying logging implementation (Log4J,
Java SE logger, etc.) you wish to use. For Log4J, full instructions are
in its https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/index.html[manual], but in
a nutshell:

* Add `log4j.jar` to your classpath
* Create a `log4j.properties` file specifying desired logging
configuration (The Camel distribution has example `log4j.properties` files
you can use -- see for example in the
link:../../../../examples/camel-example-bam/src/main/resources[/examples/camel-example-bam/src/main/resources] folder.)
* Place the `log4j.properties` file in the folder where the compiled
`.class` files are located (typically the `classes` folder) -- this will
place the properties file on the classpath, where it needs to be at
runtime.
