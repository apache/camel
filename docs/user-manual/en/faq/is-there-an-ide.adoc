=== Is there an IDE for editing Camel routes?

Apache Camel offers no IDE out of the box.

You could use your Java IDE for smart completion when creating
link:../routes.adoc[Java routing rules] via the link:../dsl.adoc[DSL] which
will give you smart completion in Java code.
Or you can use your XML IDE (with XSD smart completion) to edit the
link:../spring.adoc[routing rules in XML] using the
link:../xml-configuration.adoc[XML Configuration]

Some of the link:../commercial-camel-offerings.adoc[Commercial Companies]
offers IDE's and other tooling for Camel.
