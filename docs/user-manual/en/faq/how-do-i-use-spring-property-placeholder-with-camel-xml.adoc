=== How do I use Spring Property Placeholder with Camel XML

We do *NOT* yet support the `${something}` notation inside arbitrary
Camel XML. For example at the time of writing this is *NOT* supported
(due Spring limitations).

*IS NOT SUPPORTED*

      <to uri="mock:results"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>

However you can use the `<endpoint/>` element to define endpoints which
does support the property resolving which you can then refer to by name,
using the <<ref-component,Ref>> component as shown below (notice the `ref:`
in the URI):

*SUPPORTED*

Camel does not yet fully support property placeholders as there is a
limitation in Spring. See JIRA
http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-4466[SPR-4466]

===== Bridge Spring and Camel property placeholders

From Camel 2.10 onwards you can bridge Spring and Camel property
placeholders, see link:../using-propertyplaceholder.adoc[Using
PropertyPlaceholder] for more details.

Here is a trick that you can use to define the uri in a property file
using Spring injection and Camel endpoint:
http://cmoulliard.blogspot.com/2009/05/trick-to-pass-uri-declared-in-property.html.

From Camel 2.3 onwards there is a <<properties-component,Properties>>
component build in Camel core which allows you to use properties in the
same way as Spring property placeholders, and even more.
