=== How can I become a committer

First of all you need to get involved and
link:../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md[Contribute] via the mail list, forums, edit the
documentation, work on the issue tracker and submit patches.

Once you're contributing and your work is good, one of our
link:../team.adoc[Team] may invite you to be a committer (after we've

kicks into place...

Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some
