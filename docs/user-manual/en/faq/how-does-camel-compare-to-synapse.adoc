=== How does Camel compare to Synapse?

We are Camel developers so take what you read here with a pinch of salt.
If you want to read a less biased comparison
http://rajith.2rlabs.com/2008/02/11/synapse-vs-camel/[try reading this
review which has a slight Synapse bias since the author mostly uses
Synapse] :smile:

However we think the main differences are:

* the Camel community is way more active according to the
http://www.nabble.com/Camel-f22882.html[nabble statistics] (Synapse is
inside the Apache Web Services bar) or by comparing
http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=camel[Camel] and
http://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=synapse[Synapse] on markmail.
* Camel is the default routing engine included in
http://activemq.apache.org/[Apache ActiveMQ] for Message Orientated
middleware with EIP and http://servicemix.apache.org/[Apache ServiceMix]
the ESB based around OSGi and JBI at Apache - both of which are
http://www.nabble.com/Apache-f90.html[very popular too].
* Camel is designed from the ground up around
link:../enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] -- having an EIP pattern language implemented in
link:../dsl.adoc[Java], link:../spring.adoc[Spring XML],
link:../scala-dsl.adoc[Scala] and link:../groovy-dsl.adoc[Groovy] as well as
link:../visualisation.adoc[EIP Visualisations].
* Camel is designed to work with pretty much all kinds of
link:../transport.adoc[transport] as well as working with any
link:../data-format.adoc[Data Format]. When we first looked at Synapse it
was based around Axis 2 and WS-* though apparently thats no longer the
case.
