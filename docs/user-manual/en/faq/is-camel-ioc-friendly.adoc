=== Is Camel IoC friendly?

The quick answer is, yes absolutely! :smile:
Now for the longer answer...

[[IsCamelIoCfriendly-Spring]]
==== Spring

In particular we've gone out of our way to make Camel work great with
link:../spring.adoc[Spring] and to reuse all of Spring 2.x's power. For
example:

* the CamelContext, Components and Endpoints and their dependent beans
can be configured in Spring using Spring custom XML namespaces or
traditional bean/property elements
* we implement a spring BeanPostProcessor to allow POJOs to be injected
with Camel resources along with powerful
link:../bean-integration.adoc[Bean Integration] which allows any
spring-injected POJO to be used inside Camel along with full support
for Spring Remoting.

What we've tried to do is implement the
link:../inversion-of-control-with-smart-defaults.adoc[Inversion Of Control With Smart Defaults]
pattern; namely that you can configure Camel in a
single XML element (or very small amont of XML) to get going, then you
can overload default configurations to add more explicit configuration
as and when you need it.

[[IsCamelIoCfriendly-OtherIoCcontainers]]
==== Other IoC containers

Spring is clearly the leading IoC container; though there are some
others such as Guice, OSGi, Pico, HiveMind & Plexus so we have made the
IoC pluggable in Camel.
For example camel-core has no dependencies on anything other than
commons-logging; camel-spring contains all the link:../spring.adoc[Spring]
integration, etc.

We hope to have closer integration to other IoC containers, particularly
with Guice. The current mechanism for hooking into other IoC containers
are:

* link:../injector.adoc[Injector] is used to perform dependency injection
on a type when sing the
link:../inversion-of-control-with-smart-defaults.adoc[Inversion Of Control
With Smart Defaults] pattern
* link:../registry.adoc[Registry] this strategy is used to abstract away
the ApplicationContext such as to use JNDI or OSGi to lookup services on
demand

[[IsCamelIoCfriendly-UsingnoIoCcontainer]]
==== Using no IoC container

Some folks don't even use an IoC container and thats fine too :smile:
For example you can just use camel-core with pure Java and then wire
things together using just Java code (or some scripting language, etc.).

By default when referring to components, endpoints or beans by name,
it'll try look them up in the JNDI context and we've got a POJO based
JNDI provier if you need one of those too.
