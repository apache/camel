=== How does Camel work with ActiveMQ?

You can use Camel to do smart routing and implement the
link:../enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] inside:

* the ActiveMQ message broker
* the ActiveMQ JMS client

So Camel can route messages to and from <<mail-component,Mail>>,
<<file-component,File>>, <<ftp-component,FTP>>, <<jpa-component,JPA>>,
<<xmpp-component,XMPP>> other <<jms-component,JMS>> providers and any of the
other Camel link:../component.adoc[Components] as well as implementating
all of the link:../enterprise-integration-patterns.adoc[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] such as link:content-based-router.html[Content
Based Router] or <<messageTranslator-eip,Message Translator>>.

EIP].
