=== Can I use Camel on Java 1.4?

Apache Camel was developed to run on Java 1.5 or later to take advantage
of the new language features like generics and annotations together with
using the Java 5 concurrency code. Starting with version 2.7.0, only
Java 1.6 is supported.

Starting with version 2.10.0, Java 1.7 is supported, but not required.
