=== Why does my JMS route only consume one message at once?

The default <<jms-component,JMS>> endpoint configuration defines
*concurrentConsumers* to be 1 so only 1 message is processed
concurrently at any point in time. To change this to make things more
concurrent, just configure this value; either at the JMS component level
or endpoint level.

E.g.

[source,java]
----
from("activemq:SomeQueue?concurrentConsumers=25").
  bean(SomeCode.class);
----
