=== How to validate the camel 1.x context xml from Apache Camel web site?

Since Camel became to be Apache Top Level Project for a while, and all
the request to the camel old web site
(http://activemq.apache.org/camel/) will be redirect to the new site
(http://camel.apache.org). We updated the camel schemas' target
namespace to refect the URL change in Camel 2.0. But we don't change the
schemas namespace of Camel 1.x to keep the compatibility.

We recently released Camel 2.0-ml, and the site schema maintenance
script always copys the latest released Camel version's schema to the
default schema without version number. You may meet the schema
validation problem if your application spring configuration is still
using the old Camel 1.x schema namespace and using the web site schema
for validations.

To walk around this issue, you just need to specify the schema version
in your Spring configuration's schemaLocation attribute.
