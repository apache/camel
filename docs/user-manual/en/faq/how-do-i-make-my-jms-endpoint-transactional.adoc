How Do I Make It Transactional?

[[HowDoIMakeMyJMSEndpointTransactional-Answer]]
==== Answer:

There are examples in the <<transactionalClient-eip,Transactional Client>>
and it is described in the _Enabling Transacted Consumption_
section of <<jms-component,JMS>>. To make a session transactional
set `transacted=true` flag on the JMS endpoint and configure
a `transactionManager` on the link:../component.adoc[Component] or
link:../endpoint.adoc[Endpoint].
