CVE-2015-5344: Apache Camel's XStream usage is vulnerable
to Remote Code Execution attacks

Severity: MEDIUM

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Camel 2.15.0 to 2.15.4, Camel 2.16.0
The unsupported Camel 2.x (2.14 and earlier) versions may be also affected.

Description: Apache Camel's camel-xstream component is vulnerable to Java object
de-serialisation vulnerability. Such as de-serializing untrusted data can lead
to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues.

Mitigation: 2.15.x users should upgrade to 2.15.5, 2.16.0 users should
upgrade to 2.16.1. And if you are using camel-xstream to serialize payload to Java objects,
then you need to explicitly list trusted packages. 

To see how to do that, please take a look at: http://camel.apache.org/xstream

The JIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-9297
refers to the various commits that resovoled the issue, and have more details.
