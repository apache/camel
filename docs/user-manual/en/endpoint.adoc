Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~

Camel supports the link:message-endpoint.html[Message Endpoint] pattern
using the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface. Endpoints are usually created by a
link:component.html[Component] and Endpoints are usually referred to in
the link:dsl.html[DSL] via their link:uris.html[URIs].

From an Endpoint you can use the following methods

* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createProducer()[createProducer()]
will create a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Producer.html[Producer]
for sending message exchanges to the endpoint
* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createConsumer(org.apache.camel.Processor)[createConsumer()]
implements the link:event-driven-consumer.html[Event Driven Consumer]
pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
when creating a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Consumer.html[Consumer]
* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createPollingConsumer()[createPollingConsumer()]
implements the link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] pattern for
consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/PollingConsumer.html[PollingConsumer]
