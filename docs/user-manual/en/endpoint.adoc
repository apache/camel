Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~

Camel supports the Message Endpoint pattern
using the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html[Endpoint]
interface. Endpoints are usually created by a
Component and Endpoints are usually referred to in
the DSL via their URIs.

From an Endpoint you can use the following methods

* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createProducer()[createProducer()]
will create a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Producer.html[Producer]
for sending message exchanges to the endpoint
* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createConsumer(org.apache.camel.Processor)[createConsumer()]
implements the Event Driven Consumer
pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
when creating a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Consumer.html[Consumer]
* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Endpoint.html#createPollingConsumer()[createPollingConsumer()]
implements the Polling Consumer pattern for
consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/PollingConsumer.html[PollingConsumer]
