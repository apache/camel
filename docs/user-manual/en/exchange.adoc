Message Exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support various message link:exchange-pattern.html[exchange patterns]
like one way link:event-message.html[Event Message] and
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] messages Camel uses an
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Exchange.html[Exchange]
interface which has a *pattern* property which can be set to *InOnly*
for an link:event-message.html[Event Message] which has a single inbound
link:message.html[Message], or *InOut* for a
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] where there is an inbound and
outbound link:message.html[Message].
