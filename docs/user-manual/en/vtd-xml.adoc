=== VTD-XML

*Available as of Camel 2.10*

The VTD-XML component supports the
http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/[VTD-XML Library] for very fast and
efficient <<xpath-language,XPath>> processing. The *camel-vtdxml* library
is provided by the https://github.com/camel-extra/camel-extra[Camel Extra]
project which hosts all *GPL* related components for Camel.

[[VTD-XML-Using]]
==== Using

The VTD-XML is implemented as a Camel <<language-component,Language>> which
allows you to easily use it in the Camel routes. This component is particular efficient for splitting files or other big
payloads.

For example to split a big file containing many persons, you could do:

[source,java]
----
from("file:inbox")
  .split().vtdxml("/persons/person").streaming()
    .to("activemq:queue:person")
  .end()
----

And in XML DSL:

[source,xml]
----
<route>
  <from uri="file:inbox"/>
  <split streaming="true">
    <vtdxml>/persons/person</vtdxml>
    <to uri="activemq:queue:person"/>
  </split>
</route>
----

This will run the <<split-eip,Splitter>> in streaming mode using
the *vtdxml* language.
