Registry

Camel supports a pluggable
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/spi/Registry.html[Registry]
plugin strategy. This allows Camel to easily work with some kind of
registry like

* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/impl/SimpleRegistry.html[SimpleRegistry]
which is a simple `java.util.Map` based registry.
* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/impl/JndiRegistry.html[JndiRegistry]
which uses the JNDI InitialContext as the registry
* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-spring/apidocs/org/apache/camel/spring/spi/ApplicationContextRegistry.html[ApplicationContextRegistry]
if you are using Spring, it uses the ApplicationContext as the registry

You can also access the Registry from the
CamelContext via the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html#getRegistry()[camelContext.getRegistry()
method]
