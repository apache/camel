Dependency Injection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Dependency Injection_ or _Inversion of Control_ is a pattern where
dependencies of an object are injected into the object without the
object being too aware of how the injection is performed. The two most
popular Dependency Injection libraries available at the time of writing
are

* Spring
* Guice
* CDI

Camel is developed such that any Dependency Injection framework can be
used easily - though we've tried hard to optimise Camel for both
Spring,CDI and Guice
