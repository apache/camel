Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Expressions and link:predicate.html[Predicates] can then be used to
create the various link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] in the link:dsl.html[DSL] or
link:xml-configuration.html[Xml Configuration] like the
link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List]. +
 To support dynamic rules Camel supports pluggable
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Expression.html[Expression]
strategies using a variety of different link:languages.html[Languages].

[[Expression-API]]
API
^^^

If you are outside of the link:dsl.html[DSL] and want to create your own
expressions you can either implement the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Expression.html[Expression
interface], reuse one of the other builders or try the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/builder/ExpressionBuilder.html[ExpressionBuilder
class].

[[Expression-Expression]]
Expression
++++++++++

The API for a Camel Expression is defined in the
`org.apache.camel.Expression` interface as shown:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public interface Expression {

    /**
     * Returns the value of the expression on the given exchange
     *
     * @param exchange the message exchange on which to evaluate the expression
     * @param type the expected type of the evaluation result
     * @return the value of the expression
     */
    <T> T evaluate(Exchange exchange, Class<T> type);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Expression-Predicate]]
Predicate
+++++++++

The API for a Camel Predicate is defined in the
`org.apache.camel.Predicate` interface as shown:

[source,java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public interface Predicate {

    /**
     * Evaluates the predicate on the message exchange and returns true if this
     * exchange matches the predicate
     * 
     * @param exchange the message exchange
     * @return true if the predicate matches
     */
    boolean matches(Exchange exchange);

}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Expression-UsingExpressionsinyourIDE]]
Using Expressions in your IDE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use different expression and predicates in your IDE you need to
perform a static import of the builder class for the language(s) you
wish to use.
