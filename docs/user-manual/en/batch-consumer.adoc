Batch Consumer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.0*

Batch Consumer is basically a link:polling-consumer.html[Polling
Consumer] that is capable of polling multiple
link:exchange.html[Exchange]s in a pool. What we have done in Camel 2.0
is to standardize this into a `org.apache.camel.BatchConsumer` interface
that a consumer can implement to indicate it support batching as well.

The following components supports link:batch-consumer.html[Batch
Consumer] by its consumer:

* <<atom-component,Atom>>
* link:file2.html[File]
* link:ftp2.html[FTP]
* <<hbase-component,hbase>>
* <<ibatis-component,iBatis>>
* <<jpa-component,JPA>>
* <<jclouds-component,JCLOUDS>>
* <<mail-component,Mail>>
* <<mybatis-component,MyBatis>>
* <<snmp-component,SNMP>>
* <<sql-component,SQL>>
* <<aws-sqs-component,SQS>>
* <<aws-s3-component,S3>>
