[[RoutePolicy-RoutePolicy]]
=== RoutePolicy

*Available as of Camel 2.1*

A route policy *`org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy`* is used to control
route(s) at runtime. For example you can use it to determine whether a
route should be running or not. However the policies can support any
kind of use cases.

[[RoutePolicy-Howitworks]]
==== How it works

You associate a route with a given *`RoutePolicy`* and then during
runtime Camel will invoke callbacks on this policy where you can
implement your custom logic. Camel provides a support class that is a
good base class to extend *`org.apache.camel.impl.RoutePolicySupport`*.

There are these callbacks invoked:

* `onInit` *Camel 2.3*
* `onRemove` *Camel 2.9*
* `onStart` *Camel 2.9*
* `onStop` *Camel 2.9*
* `onSuspend` *Camel 2.9*
* `onResume` *Camel 2.9*
* `onExchangeBegin`
* `onExchangeDone`

See the Javadoc of the *`org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy`* for more
details. And also the implementation of the
*`org.apache.camel.impl.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`* for a concrete
example.

Camel provides the following policies out of the box:

* *`org.apache.camel.impl.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`* - a throttling
based policy that automatic suspends/resumes route(s) based on metrics
from the current in flight exchanges. You can use this to dynamically
throttle e.g. a link:jms.html[JMS] consumer, to avoid it consuming too
fast.

As of *Camel 2.5*, Camel also provides an ability to schedule routes to
be activated, deactivated, suspended and/or resumed at certain times
during the day using a
link:scheduledroutepolicy.html[ScheduledRoutePolicy] (offered via the
http://camel.apache.org/quartz.html[camel-quartz] component).

[[RoutePolicy-SuspendableService]]
==== SuspendableService

If you want to dynamic suspend/resume routes as the
*`org.apache.camel.impl.ThrottlingRoutePolicy`* does then its advised to
use *`org.apache.camel.SuspendableService`* as it allows for fine
grained *`suspend`* and *`resume`* operations. And use the
*`org.apache.camel.util.ServiceHelper`* to aid when invoking these
operations as it support fallback for regular
*`org.apache.camel.Service`* instances.

[[RoutePolicy-ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy]]
==== `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`

The *`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`* is triggered when an
link:exchange.adoc[Exchange] is complete, which means that it requires
at least one link:exchange.adoc[Exchange] to be complete before it
_works_.

The throttling inflight route policy has the following options:

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|===

|Option |Default |Description

|`scope` |`Route` |A scope for either *`Route`* or *`Context`* which defines if the current
number of inflight exchanges is context based or for that particular
route.

|`maxInflightExchanges` |`1000` |The maximum threshold when the throttling will start to suspend the
route if the current number of inflight exchanges is higher than this
value.

|`resumePercentOfMax` |`70` |A percentage *`0..100`* which defines when the throttling should resume
again in case it has been suspended.

|`loggingLevel` |`INFO` |The logging level used for logging the throttling activity.

|`logger` |`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` |The logger category.
|===

[[RoutePolicy-ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy]]
====  ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy compared to the Throttler EIP

The *`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`* compared to
link:throttler.html[Throttler] is that it does *not* block during
throttling. It does throttling that is approximate based, meaning that
its more coarse grained and not explicit precise as the
link:throttler.html[Throttler]. The link:throttler.html[Throttler] can
be much more accurate and only allow a specific number of messages being
passed per a given time unit. Also the *`ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`*
is based its metrics on number of inflight exchanges where as
link:throttler.html[Throttler] is based on number of messages per time
unit.

[[RoutePolicy-ConfiguringPolicy]]
==== Configuring Policy

You configure the route policy as follows from Java DSL, using the
*`routePolicy`* method:

[source,java]
-----------------------------------------------------------
  RoutePolicy myPolicy = new MyRoutePolicy();
  from("seda:foo").routePolicy(myPolicy).to("mock:result");
-----------------------------------------------------------

In Spring XML its a bit different as follows using the
*`routePolicyRef`* attribute:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="myPolicy" class="com.mycompany.MyRoutePolicy"/>
   
<route routePolicyRef="myPolicy">
    <from uri="seda:foo"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
---------------------------------------------------------

[[RoutePolicy-ConfiguringPolicySets]]
==== Configuring Policy Sets

*Available as of Camel 2.7*

*`RoutePolicy`* has been further improved to allow addition of policy
sets or a collection of policies that are concurrently applied on a
route. The addition of policies is done as follows.

In the example below, the route *`testRoute`* has a *`startPolicy`*
and *`throttlePolicy`* applied concurrently. Both policies are applied
as necessary on the route.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="date" class="org.apache.camel.routepolicy.quartz.SimpleDate"/>

<bean id="startPolicy" class="org.apache.camel.routepolicy.quartz.SimpleScheduledRoutePolicy">
  <property name="routeStartDate" ref="date"/>
  <property name="routeStartRepeatCount" value="1"/>
  <property name="routeStartRepeatInterval" value="3000"/>        
</bean>

<bean id="throttlePolicy" class="org.apache.camel.impl.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy">
  <property name="maxInflightExchanges" value="10"/>        
</bean>
         
<camelContext id="testRouteContext" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
  <route id="testRoute" autoStartup="false" routePolicyRef="startPolicy, throttlePolicy">
    <from uri="seda:foo?concurrentConsumers=20"/>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </route>
</camelContext>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[RoutePolicy-UsingRoutePolicyFactory]]
==== Using `RoutePolicyFactory`

*Available as of Camel 2.14*

If you want to use a route policy for every route, you can use
a *`org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicyFactory`* as a factory for creating
a *`RoutePolicy`* instance for each route. This can be used when you
want to use the same kind of route policy for every routes. Then you
need to only configure the factory once, and every route created will
have the policy assigned.

There is API on CamelContext to add a factory, as shown below

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------
context.addRoutePolicyFactory(new MyRoutePolicyFactory());
----------------------------------------------------------

And from XML DSL you just define a *`<bean>`* with the factory

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<bean id="myRoutePolicyFactory" class="com.foo.MyRoutePolicyFactory"/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The factory has a single method that creates the route policy

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /**
     * Creates a new {@link org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy} which will be assigned to the given route.
     *
     * @param camelContext the camel context
     * @param routeId      the route id
     * @param route        the route definition
     * @return the created {@link org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy}, or <tt>null</tt> to not use a policy for this route
     */
    RoutePolicy createRoutePolicy(CamelContext camelContext, String routeId, RouteDefinition route);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note you can have as many route policy factories as you want. Just call
the *`addRoutePolicyFactory`* again, or declare the other factories
as *`<bean>`* in XML.
