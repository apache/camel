Exchange Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many different _Message Exchange Patterns_ you can use in
messaging. This concept is also demonstrated in WSDL and JBI's MEPs.

From there link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] the common examples are

* link:request-reply.html[Request Reply]
* link:event-message.html[Event Message] (or one way)

In Camel we have an
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/ExchangePattern.html[ExchangePattern]
enumeration which can be configured on the *exchangePattern* property on
the Message link:exchange.html[Exchange] indicating if a message
exchange is a one way link:event-message.html[Event Message] (InOnly) or
a link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] message exchange (InOut).

For example to override the default pattern on a link:jms.html[JMS]
endpoint you could use this URI

[source,java]

jms:MyQueue?exchangePattern=InOut
