Welcome to Apache Camel
=============================================================================== 

Apache Camel is a powerful Spring based Integration Framework.

Camel implements the Enterprise Integration Patterns allowing you to configure
routing and mediation rules in either a Java based Domain Specific Language
(or Fluent API) or via Spring based Xml Configuration files. Either approaches
mean you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE whether in your
Java or XML editor.

Apache Camel uses URIs so that it can easily work directly with any kind of
Transport or messaging model such as HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA
or CXF Bus API together with working with pluggable Data Format options.
Apache Camel is a small library which has minimal dependencies for easy
embedding in any Java application.

Apache Camel can be used as a routing and mediation engine for the
following projects:

    * Apache ActiveMQ which is the most popular and powerful open
      source message broker
    * Apache CXF which is a smart web services suite (JAX-WS)
    * Apache MINA a networking framework
    * Apache ServiceMix which is the most popular and powerful distributed
      open source ESB and JBI container
