Camel Data Format Project
====================

This Project is a template of a Camel data format.

When you create a data format project, you need to move the META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/dataformat/${name}
file to META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/dataformat/foo where "foo" is the URI scheme for your data format.

To build this project use

    mvn install

For more help see the Apache Camel documentation:
