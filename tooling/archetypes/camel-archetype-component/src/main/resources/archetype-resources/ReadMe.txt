Camel Component Project
====================
This Project is a template of a Camel component.

When you create a component project, you need to move the META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/${name}
file to META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo where "foo" is the URI scheme for your component and any
related endpoints created on the fly.

For more help see the Apache Camel documentation:
