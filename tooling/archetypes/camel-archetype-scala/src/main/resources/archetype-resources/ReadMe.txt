Camel Router with Scala DSL Project
===================================

To run this router either embed the jar inside Spring
or to run the route from within maven try

    mvn camel:run
    
This project builds an OSGi bundle that can be used to
embed the Camel routes in ServiceMix Kernel or another
OSGi runtime.
