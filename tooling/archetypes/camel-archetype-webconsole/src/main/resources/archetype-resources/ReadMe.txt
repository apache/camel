Camel Router WAR Project with Web Console and REST Support
==========================================================

This project bundles the Camel Web Console, REST API, and some
sample routes as a WAR. You can build the WAR by running

mvn install

You can then run the project by dropping the WAR into your 
favorite web container or just run

mvn jetty:run

to start up and deploy to Jetty.


Web Console
===========

You can view the Web Console by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/

You should be able to do things like

    * browse the available endpoints
    * browse the messages on an endpoint if it is a browsable endpoint
    * send a message to an endpoint
    * create new endpoints
