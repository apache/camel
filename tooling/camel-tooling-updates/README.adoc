= Apache Camel Update Recipes

This project contains recipes to assist in the migration of Camel projects.

You can find the recipes in the src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite directory.

The names of the recipes correspond to the Camel version they support, formatted as [major].[minor].yaml. To migrate from version X.Y to version A.B, apply all recipes with versions greater than X.Y and less than A.B.

For example, to migrate from version 3.8 to 4.4, you need to apply the recipes `*4.0.yaml*` and `*4.4.yaml*`.

== How to run from cmd

To apply recipes on a standalone Camel Project you can use maven plugin:

```

mvn -U org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:5.20.0:run \
-Drewrite.recipeArtifactCoordinates=org.apache.camel:camel-tooling-updates:4.7.0-SNAPSHOT \
-DactiveRecipes=org.apache.camel.updates.camel44.CamelMigrationRecipe
-Drewrite.recipeFile=/org.apache.camel.updates/4.0.yaml
```

== JUnit testing

Several migration paths to different versions must be covered by the tests.
Therefore, the project uses the maven-dependency-plugin to download various versions of certain libraries.

Libraries are not packed into the installed jar.

== Test jar

Project installs also test classes into a `test-jar` artifact.
This allows other projects (like https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-updates/[quarkus-updates]) to laverage from the tests.
