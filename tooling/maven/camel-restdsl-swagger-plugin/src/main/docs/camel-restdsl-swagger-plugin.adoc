= Camel REST DSL Swagger Maven Plugin

The Camel REST DSL Swagger Maven Plugin supports the following goals

 - camel-restdsl-swagger:generate - To generate consumer REST DSL
 RouteBuilder source code from Swagger specification

 - camel-restdsl-swagger:generate-with-dto - To generate consumer REST DSL
 RouteBuilder source code from Swagger specification and with DTO model
 classes generated via the swagger-codegen-maven-plugin.

 - camel-restdsl-swagger:generate-xml - To generate consumer REST DSL
 XML source code from Swagger specification

 - camel-restdsl-swagger:generate-xml-with-dto - To generate consumer REST DSL
 XML source code from Swagger specification  and with DTO model
 classes generated via the swagger-codegen-maven-plugin.

== Adding plugin to Maven pom.xml

This plugin can be added to your Maven pom.xml file by adding it to the `<plugins>` section,
for example in a Spring Boot application:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
      <artifactId>camel-restdsl-swagger-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>2.23.0</version>
    </plugin>

  </plugins>
</build>
----

The plugin can then be executed via its prefix `camel-restdsl-swagger` as shown

    $mvn camel-restdsl-swagger generate

== camel-restdsl-swagger:generate

The `camel-restdsl-swagger:generate` goal of the Camel REST DSL
Swagger Maven Plugin is used to generate REST DSL RouteBuilder
implementation source code from Maven.

=== Options

The plugin supports the following options which can be configured from
the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file 
in the `<configuration>` tag.

|========================================
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| `skip` | `false` | Set to `true` to skip code generation.
| `filterOperation` | | Used for including only the operation ids specified. Multiple ids can be separated by comma. Wildcards can be used, eg `find*` to include all operations starting with `find`.
| `specificationUri` | `src/spec/swagger.json` | URI of the Swagger specification, loaded using Swagger's resource loading mechanism, supports filesystem paths, HTTP and classpath resources, by default `src/spec/swagger.json` within the project directory.  Supports JSON and YAML.
| `className` | from `title` or `RestDslRoute` | Name of the generated class, taken from the Swagger specification title or set to `RestDslRoute` by default
| `packageName` | from `host` or `rest.dsl.generated` | Name of the package for the generated class, taken from the Swagger specification host value or `rest.dsl.generated` by default
| `indent` | `"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"` | What identing character(s) to use, by default four spaces, you can use `\t` to signify tab character
| `outputDirectory` | `generated-sources/restdsl-swagger` | Where to place the generated source file, by default `generated-sources/restdsl-swagger` within the project directory
| `destinationGenerator` | | Fully qualified class name of the class that implements `org.apache.camel.generator.swagger.DestinationGenerator` interface for customizing destination endpoint
| `restConfiguration` | `true` | Whether to include generation of the rest configuration with detected rest component to be used. 
| `apiContextPath` | | Define swagger endpoint path if `restConfiguration` is set to `true`. |
|========================================

=== Spring Boot Project with Servlet component

If the Maven project is a Spring Boot project and `restConfiguration` is enabled and the servlet component
is being used as REST component, then this plugin will autodetect the package name (if packageName has not been explicit configured)
 where the `@SpringBootApplication` main class is located, and use the same package name
 for generating Rest DSL source code and a needed `CamelRestController` support class.

== camel-restdsl-swagger:generate-with-dto

Works as `generate` goal but also generates DTO model classes by automatic executing
the swagger-codegen-maven-plugin to generate java source code of the DTO model classes
from the swagger specification.

This plugin has been scoped and limited to only support a good effort set of defaults for
using the swagger-codegen-maven-plugin to generate the model DTOs. If you need more power
and flexibility then use the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/modules/swagger-codegen-maven-plugin[Swagger Codegen Maven Plugin]
directly to generate the DTO and not this plugin.

The DTO classes may require additional dependencies such as:
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
      <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
      <version>2.8.5</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.threeten</groupId>
      <artifactId>threetenbp</artifactId>
      <version>1.3.7</version>
    </dependency>
----

=== Options

The plugin supports the following *additional* options

|========================================
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| `swaggerCodegenMavenPluginVersion` | 2.3.1 | The version of the `io.swagger:swagger-codegen-maven-plugin` maven plugin to be used.
| `modelOutput` | | Target output path (default is ${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/swagger)
| `modelPackage` | `io.swagger.client.model` | The package to use for generated model objects/classes
| `modelNamePrefix` | | Sets the pre- or suffix for model classes and enums
| `modelNameSuffix` | | Sets the pre- or suffix for model classes and enums
| `modelWithXml` | true | Enable XML annotations inside the generated models (only works with ibraries that provide support for JSON and XML)
|========================================


== camel-restdsl-swagger:generate-xml

The `camel-restdsl-swagger:generate-xml` goal of the Camel REST DSL
Swagger Maven Plugin is used to generate REST DSL XML
implementation source code from Maven.

=== Options

The plugin supports the following options which can be configured from
the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file
in the `<configuration>` tag.

|========================================

| `fileName` | `camel-rest.xml` | The name of the XML file as output.
| `blueprint` | `false` | If enabled generates OSGi Blueprint XML instead of Spring XML.
| `destinationGenerator` | | Fully qualified class name of the class that implements `org.apache.camel.generator.swagger.DestinationGenerator` interface for customizing destination endpoint
| `restConfiguration` | `true` | Whether to include generation of the rest configuration with detected rest component to be used.
| `apiContextPath` | | Define swagger endpoint path if `restConfiguration` is set to `true`. |
