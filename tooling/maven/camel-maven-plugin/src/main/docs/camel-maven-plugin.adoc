= Camel Maven Plugin

The Camel Maven Plugin supports the following goals

 - camel:run - To run your Camel application
 - camel:prepare-fatjar - To prepare your Camel application for being packaged as a fat-jar (such as by maven-assembly-plugin)

== camel:run

The `camel:run` goal of the Camel Maven Plugin is used to run your Camel Spring configurations in a forked JVM from Maven.
A good example application to get you started is the Spring Example.

----
cd examples/camel-example-spring
mvn camel:run
----

This makes it very easy to spin up and test your routing rules without having to write a main(...) method;
it also lets you create multiple jars to host different sets of routing rules and easily test them independently.

How this works is that the plugin will compile the source code in the maven project,
then boot up a Spring ApplicationContext using the XML configuration files on the classpath at `META-INF/spring/*.xml`

If you want to boot up your Camel routes a little faster, you could try the `camel:embedded` instead.

=== Options

The maven plugin *run* goal supports the following options which can be configured from the command line (use `-D` syntax), or defined in the `pom.xml` file in the `<configuration>` tag.

|===
| Parameter | Default Value | Description
| duration | -1 | Sets the time duration (seconds) that the application will run for before terminating. A value <= 0 will run forever.
| durationIdle | -1 | Sets the idle time duration (seconds) duration that the application can be idle before terminating. A value <= 0 will run forever.
| durationMaxMessages | -1 | Sets the duration of maximum number of messages that the application will process before terminating.
| logClasspath | false | Whether to log the classpath when starting
| logLevel | OFF | Whether to use built-in console logging (uses log4j), which does not require to add any logging dependency to your project. However, the logging is fixed to log to the console, with a color style that is similar to Spring Boot. You can change the root logging level to: FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, OFF
|===


=== Running OSGi Blueprint

Use the `camel-karaf-maven-plugin` which is intended for Apache Camel on Karaf/OSGi.

=== Running CDI

The `camel:run` plugin also supports running a CDI application

This allows you to boot up any CDI services you wish - whether they are Camel-related, or any other CDI enabled services.
You should add the CDI container of your choice (e.g. Weld or OpenWebBeans) to the dependencies of the camel-maven-plugin such as in this example.

From the source of Camel you can run a CDI example via

----
cd examples/camel-example-cdi
mvn compile camel:run
----

=== Logging the classpath

You can configure whether the classpath should be logged when `camel:run` executes.
You can enable this in the configuration using:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <logClasspath>true</logClasspath>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

=== Using built-in logging

If you want quickly to have logging to console, you can use the built-in logging by setting the logging level as shown:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <logLevel>INFO</logLevel>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

This runs the application with console logging, in color that is similar to Spring Boot logging.
This is default turned off, to use the configured logging system in the project.

The idea with the built-in logging is that you sometimes want to avoid messing with setting
up logging, and just want a quick and easy log to console that looks good.


== camel:prepare-fatjar

The `camel:prepare-fatjar` goal of the Camel Maven Plugin is used to prepare your Camel application
for being packaged as a _fat jar_. The goal scans the Maven dependencies to discover Camel JARs and
extract if they have type converters, which gets merged together into a single _uber_ file stored
in `target/classes/META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/UberTypeConverterLoader`.

This _uber_ loader file contains all the combined type converters the Camel application uses at runtime.
They are merged together into this single file.

This is needed as otherwise the _fat jar_ maven plugins (such as maven-assembly-plugin, or maven-shade-plugin)
causes the `TypeConverterLoader` files to be overwritten in the assembled JAR which causes not all type converters
to be loaded by Camel.

The `UberTypeConverterLoader` ensures they all type converters gets loaded as this file contains all the known
type converter files.

To use this goal, you can add the following to your Camel application `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${camel.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>prepare-fatjar</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
----

For example to use this with the `maven-assembly-plugin` you can do as below.
Remember to specify the class name of *your* main class where it says `com.foo.NameOfMainClass`:

[source,xml]
----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${camel.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>prepare-fatjar</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <archive>
            <manifest>
              <mainClass>com.foo.NameOfMainClass</mainClass>
            </manifest>
          </archive>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
