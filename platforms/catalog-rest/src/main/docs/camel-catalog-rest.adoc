= Camel Catalog REST Api

The camel-catalog-rest is a tiny REST API of the Camel Catalog. The API is implemented as a JAX-RS resource class
with Swagger Annotations to offer Swagger documentation.

== Dependencies

The camel-catalog-rest dependencies has been kept low and neutral so any JAX-RS server can be used to
host the Camel Catalog REST API.

```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
      <artifactId>camel-catalog</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- REST api -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.ws.rs</groupId>
      <artifactId>javax.ws.rs-api</artifactId>
      <version>${javax.ws.rs-api-version}</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- swagger annotations -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.swagger</groupId>
      <artifactId>swagger-annotations</artifactId>
      <version>${swagger-java-version}</version>
    </dependency>
```

== Trying the CamelCatalog REST Api

You can try the rest api by running the `camel-rest-app` application

```
   cd camel-rest-app
   mvn compile exec:java
```

Then a little standalone application with CXF and embedded Jetty starts up the Camel Catalog REST API service
which you can access using the urls the application logs to the console.

The application has built in Swagger UI which you can use to try the api.
