## Connector Component

The connector component is an abstract component that is used as a building block to build a Camel connector.


### What is a Camel connector?

A Camel connector is a simplified setup of any existing Camel component. The idea is to be able to pre-configure
  a connector to a specific use-case, such as _add contact to salesforce_, or _add calender entry_,
  or _new leads from twitter_.

The existing Camel components are generic and have many options. Therefore to use any of these components you
   need to understand how to use and setup all these options.


### How it works

The connector is based on one of the existing Camel components (or 3rd party component) by which you can specify
in a `camel-connector.json` file which options to pre-select and as well specify other default values etc.

Then the `camel-connector-maven-plugin` Maven plugin will build this as a Camel component,
so at runtime its just a regular Camel component.

Because connectors are just regular Camel component there is no problem running them in Camel applications.

In addition all existing JMX, tooling et all just sees this as Camel components and can use that.
Also at design time, for example the Apache Camel IDEA plugin will see the connector as a 3rd party Camel component
and offer code assistance to it etc.

You can have as many connectors you want, and a Camel component can have many connectors.
For example you can have multiple connectors to the `camel-salesforce` component, where each connectors
is specialized to do a different use-case with Salesforce.


### How to create a Connector

You can use the Maven archetype `camel-archetype-connector` to create a new connector. You would need to specify
some values as input to select the existing Camel component to use as base, and then in addition the name and title
of the connector, and a few other values as well.

You can also copy the existing examples from the `connectors` directory where the following connectors examples is provided:

- `foo-connector` - A connector that is based on the Timer component from `camel-core`.
- `bar-connector` - A connector that is based on the 3rd party `beverage-component`.
- `wine-connector` - Another connector that is based on the 3rd party `beverage-component`.

You can find an example using these connectors in the `foo-bar-wine-example` in the `connectors` directory.


### The connectors schema file

A connector has a schema file `camel-connector.json` located in `src/main/resources` directory.

This schema holds the information where you can pre-configure and specify which options a connector should offer.

The options the connector can provide is a limited set of all the existing options that comes from the Camel component
its based upon. Each option can then also be pre-configured with a default-value.

To understand this schema file, its easier to study those existing connectors from the `connectors` directory.
