## Contributing to Apache Camel

There are many ways you can help make Camel a better piece of software - please dive in and help!
- Try surf the documentation - if somethings confusing or not clear, let us know.
- Download the code & try it out and see what you think.
- Browse the source code. Got an itch to scratch, want to tune some operation or add some feature?
- Want to do some hacking on Camel? Try surfing the our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL) for open issues or features that need to be implemented, take ownership of an issue and try fix it.
- If you are a new Camel rider and would like to help us, you can also find [some easy to resolve issues.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=12316782)
- Leave a comment on the issue to let us know you are working on it and add yourself as a watcher to get informed about all modifications.

## Getting in touch

There are various ways of communicating with the Camel community.
- Join us on the [Discussion Forums](http://camel.apache.org/discussion-forums.html) and take part in any conversations
- Pop by on [IRC](http://camel.apache.org/irc-room.html) and say hi
- Add some comments to the [wiki](http://camel.apache.org/navigation.html)


## Improving the documentation

Documentation is massively important to help users make the most of Apache Camel and its probably the area that needs the most help!
So if you are interested in helping the documentation effort; whether its just to fix a page here or there, correct a link or even write a tutorial or improve what documentation is already there please do dive in and help!
Most of the documentation is stored on the wiki. We are currently moving the documentation into the code (AsciiDoc). From there it is automatically converted to the wiki. So before editing the wiki check the code because otherwise your changes may be lost. This transition is work-in-progress.

See [How does the website work](http://camel.apache.org/how-does-the-website-work.html) or [How do I edit the website for more details](http://camel.apache.org/how-do-i-edit-the-website.html).
To be able to edit the wiki you need
- an appropriate licence agreement on file with the ASF
- an account on the wiki (on the bottom of each page there is an edit button, that allows you to create an account)
- karma - mail the dev list asking for permission (to prevent spam we only offer access to the wiki by folks sending mail to the mailing list).


## If you find a bug or problem

Please raise a new issue in our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL)
If you can create a JUnit test case then your issue is more likely to be resolved quicker.
e.g. take a look at some of the existing [unit tests cases](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/)
Then we can add your issue to Subversion and then we'll know when its really fixed and we can ensure that the problem stays fixed in future releases.


## Working on the code

We recommend to work on the code from [github](https://github.com/apache/camel/).

    git clone https://github.com/apache/camel.git
    cd camel

Build the project (fast build).

    mvn clean install -Pfastinstall

If you intend to work on the code and provide patches and other work you want to submit to the Apache Camel project, then you can fork the project on github and work on your own fork. The custom work you do should be done on branches you create, which can then be committed and pushed upstream, and then submitted to Apache Camel as PRs (pull requests). You can find many resources online how to work on github projects and how to submit work to these projects.


## Running checkstyle

Apache Camel source code is using a coding style/format which can be checked whether is complying using the checkstyle plugin.
To enable source style checking with checkstyle, build Camel with the -Psourcecheck parameter

    mvn clean install -Psourcecheck

Please remember to run this check on your code changes before submitting a patch or github PR. You do not need to run this against the entire project, but for example in the modules you work on. Lets say you do some code changes in the camel-ftp component, then you can run the check from within this directory:

    cd camel-ftp
    mvn clean install -Psourcecheck


## Apache Camel committers should work on the ASF git repo

If you are an Apache Camel committer then clone the ASF git repo at

    git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/camel.git
    cd camel

or 

    git clone https://github.com/apache/camel.git
    cd camel

Build the project (without testing).

    mvn clean install -Dtest=false

PS: You might need to build multiple times (if you get a build error) because sometimes maven fails to download all the files.
Then import the projects into your workspace.


## Creating patches

We recommend you create patches as github PRs which is much easier for us to accept and work with. You do this as any other github project, where you can fork the project, and create a branch where you work on the code, and then commit and push that code to your fork. Then navigate to the Apache Camel github webpage, and you will see that github in the top of the page has a wizard to send your recent work as a PR (pull request).


## Pull request at Github

There is also a Git repository at Github which you could fork. Then you submit patches as any other github project - eg work on a new feature branch and send a pull request. One of the committers then needs to accept your pull request to bring the code  to the ASF codebase. After the code has been included into the ASF codebase, you need to close the pull request because we can't do that...

When providing code patches then please include the Camel JIRA ticket number in the commit messages.
We favor using the syntax:

    CAMEL-9999: Some message goes here

## Manual patch files
We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix Camel in some way.

We recommend using github PRs instead of manual patch files. Especially for bigger patches.

Most IDEs can create nice patches now very easily. e.g. in Eclipse just right click on a file/directory and select Team -> Create Patch. Then just save the patch as a file and then submit it. (You may have to click on Team -> Share... first to enable the Subversion options).
If you're a command line person try the following to create the patch

    diff -u Main.java.orig Main.java >> patchfile.txt

or

    git diff --no-prefix > patchfile.txt


## Submitting patches

The easiest way to submit a patch is to
- [create a new JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL) (you will need to register),
- attach the patch or tarball as an attachment (if you create a patch file, but we recommend using github PRs)
- **tick the Patch Attached** button on the issue
We prefer patches has unit tests as well and that these unit tests have proper assertions as well, so remember to replace your system.out or logging with an assertion instead!


## Using the issue tracker

Before you can raise an issue in the [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL) you need to register with it. This is quick & painless.


## Becoming a committer

Once you've got involved as above, we may well invite you to be a committer. See [How do I become a committer](http://camel.apache.org/how-do-i-become-a-committer.html) for more details.

The first step is contributing to the project; if you want to take that a step forward and become a fellow committer on the project then see the [Committer Guide](http://activemq.apache.org/becoming-a-committer.html)


## More resources

Git is not a brand new technology and therefore Camel is not the only ASF project thinking about using it. So here are some more resources you mind find useful:
- [https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/camel.git](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/camel.git): Apache Camel GitBox repository
- [http://wiki.apache.org/general/GitAtApache](http://wiki.apache.org/general/GitAtApache): Some basic notes about git@asf
- [http://git.apache.org/](http://git.apache.org/): List of git-mirrors at ASF
